An event in the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15, March 2020.
A growing trend in the case of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows the same rates in the European Union/ European Economic Area and the United Kingdom that, while in different regions of the world, the plague of Corvid-19 is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, emergency hospitals, and units should increase their willingness to accept many patients with COVID-19 who will need health care, and especially care for those in emergency situations.
In 31 December 2019, an unidentified group of pneumonia persons was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the technology that causes the new Coronavirus, now called respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-Cov2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV2 has been named Coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence to date indicates that 80 percent of the people with CIVID-19 are suffering from a mild form of respiratory disease, which is associated with or anti - pneumonia, and most of these people are recovering.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is developing into a most serious illness that requires hospitalization while 6% of the remaining circumstances are facing a serious emergency.
The deaths of patients laid for COVID-19 are 4%.
In this study, we examine the increasing stations of the COVID-19 in each European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those in the Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 persons in the EU/EA and UK and that of Italy between 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 states in EU/EA and UK
After China, COVID-19 was widely spread in terms and the change of the plague of COVID-19 worldwide is currently following what is taking place in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the director of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 was a disaster.
The 5 March of the Eurosurveillance 2020, the Sporter et al. reported on the first confirmed individuals of the COVID-19 European in harmony with WHO's definition.
In the EU/EA, the first confirmed individuals were reported by France on 24, January 2020 by the people who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the COVID-19 people had been discovered in all 30 countries of the EU/EA and the United Kingdom (UK), that is between 31 December 2019 and that day, 39,768 infected persons and 1,727 people died, in this case 17,750 persons with the virus and 1,41 dead were Italians only.
To obtain a growing number and an increasing number of cases of COVID-19
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the figures of the population with the COVID-19 in each country, which are found only by legal sources like the World Health Department of each country, national and provincial health authorities and WHO, are repeated each day by 8:00 a.m.
This chart was used to analyze the COVID-19 stations of the EU/EA and the UK, compared with those in Italy.
As a representative of the frequency of the COVID-19 conditions, we count the growing occurrence of the 14 days of the COVID-19 conditions, thus considering the normal continuation of the COVID-19, each EURO/EA and UK, during the 1 January–15 March 2020 period.
We also released an increasing number of reported conditions each country on 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared with Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 stations in the EU/EEA and the UK
In the EU/EA and the UK countries normally follow those of the Hubei Provence (Chinese) 14 days' status of COVID-19.
In all the EU/EA and the UK, the growing instance of the COVID-19 began to rise about 21 February and was very happy in 28 February 2020 (Supreme for reading).
This was greatly increased by the rapid increase in the number of reported conditions from Italy, but all the other EU/EA and the UK countries show the same increasing rates of the increase in the development of the COVID-19 (Reading Extension).
Model 2 shows an increasing number of COVID-19 conditions, in the EU/EA and UK countries compared with that of Italy in 31 January–15 March 2020.
It makes clear that, by March 15, 8:00 a.m., some 15 EU/EA countries and the UK had already reported a total that could be compared with that Italian in 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported conditions of COVID-19 increases rapidly in the EU/EA and the UK.
The stations noted in the growing instance of the COVID-19 show that the plague continues at the same speed in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are in different categories, the variety of public health responses of the country, and likely different explanations of conditions in countries as well as different prostheses for patients to be tested to ensure the approval of the COVID-19, which includes follow-up research.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian states described a situation in which 10% of the patients with COVID-19 needed to take care of critical conditions and the media reported that hospitals and emergency units in these regions had reached their highest level.
The data on the entry of the COVID-19 cases to the hospital and/or emergency unit is found in the EU/EA section in only 6% and 1% cases, in sequence (not shown).
It should, however, be gathered in an orderly manner to fit the current watch that focuses on the number of reported conditions and the number of deaths.
A survey conducted in 2010–11 showed a significant difference regarding the discovery of emergency beds and central care facilities in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in 4.2 in the Portuguese population.
This means that the countries may have more or less help than Italy (12.5 emergency - care beds and public care for 100,000 people by 2010–11).
Modeling conditions related to the total amount of health care care, which provides a standard for each EU/EA and UK state regarding the increase in conditions spread to the hospital because of the COVID-19 risk associated with the risk of crossing the number of emergency beds, is provided in a sixth review of the ECDC risk of ECDC in connection with COVID-19.
Since conditions are prevalent in some regions in the EU/EA and UK countries, and emergency - care hospitals and units often help some people to read, information about conditions and emergency beds should be found in the level of the Nomeclerature of terilitarian units for statistics 2 (NUTS2).
Italy's experiences as well as modern transoceanic rentals show that the COVID-19 epidemic is rapidly growing in the EU/EA and the UK.
The countries, hospitals, and emergency units should prepare for the ongoing SARS-CoV2 reception of SARS and the increasing number of patients affected by COVID-19 that require medical care, and especially emergency care, such as in the affected provinces of Italy.
As shown in the recent ECDC survey of an emergency, a quick, active, and detailed method is important to slow the flow of SARS-CoV2, by making a change from control mode to slow down, since the anticipated increase in the number of conditions may not provide sufficient time for decisionmakers and hospitals to understand, to accept and adapt their response if it is not used in advance.
Early - accident tests also state public health measures to control the cause of the plague.
There is little chance for countries to have access to further control of their efforts to reduce the incidence of SARS-CoV2 and reduce stress in health care.
Failure of this, it is possible that the regimens to be treated in some EU/EA countries will be met by a host of patients who need attention in the future or weeks.
The spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is currently killing over 3,000 people and affecting more than 80,000 people in China and other parts of the world, a success in human disaster.
Like its same virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV2 may also be transmitted from bats and produce similar symptoms.
The COVID-19, however, is more critical and death-rate than SARS, but is far more passed and affects more adults than the skin and more males than women.
As a way to respond to the rapidly growing number of prints about a new disease, this article is trying to provide a timely and detailed review on the subject of quick research.
We will discuss the basics concerning epidemiology, ecology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention of disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help us to understand and end the threat of a serious illness.
Spring Festival of January 25, 2020, has become an unforgettable and memorable memory for all Chinese who were encouraged to stay in their homes on vacation and then for many weeks afterward as a result of the outbreak of new virus disease.
The virus is closely related to the coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of an outbreak of the ve respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was named SARS-CoV2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 11, 2020, and a related disease called Corv Disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and spread quickly throughout the country and about 50 others around the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from the hospital as well as over 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a leading public enemy and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https:/wcb.nm.nilm.nilm..gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 pages have been printed regarding the COVID-19 issue involving its virology, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020, which decided a series of bacteria divided into many patients.
This review tries to reduce the progress of research on a new and rapidly increasing subject.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS with the other COV disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, the 2012th outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the nature of prevention and the cause of disease as well as the rest of the important but serious questions.
Corvs generally considered to be nonsmokers, primarily responsible for 15% of common colds.
In this century, however, we have had two cases of highly interstatic Corovs, that is, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the plague that began in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and were soon spread to other countries that caused terrible sickness and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third rise of the Corv record.
As shown at Death. Year 1.1.1.1), groups of Armenians with unknown origin began to be reported at Wuhan on December 31, 2019 in China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the CV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death toll was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly in neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, an influx of health - care workers was reported, which suggested that human contact was a possibility.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed down and all public transportation was set up.
On January 24 a study of the first treatment of disease reported that, of the 41 persons with confirmed conditions, only 21 had direct contact with the WUhan marine food market which was considered the first place to be a disease from an unknown source.
On January 30, WHO announced an emergency global health situation.
By the time of the report, disease has spread throughout China and about 50 countries around the world (Death.2).
As the situation changes rapidly, the outcome and the seriousness of the plague are not known.
On February 11, 2020, a study of a number of 8,866 patients involving 4,021, which were confirmed to be having COVID-19 shown a better version of the epidemic in the following way (https:/Weix.q.s.com/UlBI-HHHPHA1HA2hdA).
SARS-CoV2 has sick people throughout the years, but mainly 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50, fewer than 20, and only 14 persons less than 10.
SARS-CoV2 has caused more male cases (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The COVID-19 grew by the remainder of Hubei and nearby.
The COVID-19 took an average of 5 days (2-9) from the beginning to the test.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average period from the beginning to the end is 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic production number (R0) was 3.77 (95%: 3.51-4.05), and the modified R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of admissions increased immediately before 23 Jan.20, which was the same as the time of mass transport before Spring Festival in China.
The deaths of confirmed patients were 1.44% (95%: 1.10-1.86%), and the changed mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main factors of the COVID-19 risk were sex (man), age (.00), and acute pneumonia.
Corvs are part of a family of large, hidden viruses that contain one of the nerve fibers of the RNA.
They can be divided into four parts, that is, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, that is to say the Alpha and Beta Covs are known to infect the people.
The spike (S) of the glycoprotein envelope adheres to the receptive cells of Angiotsin-convening enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the DIPdianphydase 4 (SARS-CoV) and MES-CV, respectively, and the joining of the membrane.
The RNA gene is released from cytoplasm; after the recombinant gene, the RNA of the genes associated with glycoproteins and nucleoptic proteins build cells containing the cells, which include plasma membranes to release the virus.
The sequence of SARS-CoV2 genes was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV2 was found to be a new form of beta-CoV with 99.98% of a series of samples gathered in the first explosion, the Huananan Sead Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV2 is usually more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CV.
Using the microscopy of electron transmission, SARS-CoV2 crystals were found in the most clear parts of the epithelitium.
Ace2 persons were found to be SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV2 protein of SARS-Cov2 connects with ACE2 more rapidly than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV 2 causes less serious transmission in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV2 can also build a new short protein produced by orf3b and a extracted protein produced by an orf8.
The SARS-CoV 2 might play a role in the microchirogenicity of the virus and may prevent the appearance of IFN importance; however, the orf8 does not contain any known background or motif.
On February 18, 2020, the Zhou, et al., reported the ACEM building of ACE2 persons full height in fig.9 Å associated with the Amino acid vehicle B0AT1.
It was found that this link, with open and closed structures, was linked as a diamond and a combination of ACE2-B0AT1 to combine two S proteins, giving evidence of the appearance of the Corv and the flow.
B0AT1 may be a medical container for drug research to suppress the SARS-CoV2 flow.
Centrifugal and coagulator
It is known that both the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV began on bats and passed to people with civet cats and lawyers, respectively.
In contrast with the SARS-CoV2 phygenic and other Corvs, bats are recognized as the origin of SARS-CoV2 as the new virus is equal to 96% and 2 Corvs from bats called SL-CovZX45 of bats and the SL-CovZX2221 bat.
However, which of the shark that intervened helped the virus to cross the line between the creatures so that it could join humans is unknown, and the transmission route is still to be explained.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes may be carrying a virus from bats to people that involved the introduction of the youth of the same characteristics within S protein.
According to research, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggest that long-term lalolin - with her nose, water mammals commonly used as Chinese traditional medicines - they are probably the center of SARS-CoV2, based on 99% of the genes derived from lalolin and SARS-Cov2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genes makes a big difference; hence, the confirmed effects of strong femininity are still spared (Death.33).
The characteristics of SARS-CoV2 physicochemic factors are not known to date.
The SARS-CoV and the MEORS-CoV can survive without a creature up to 48 hours in a dry place and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40-50%.
SARS-CoV2 may have similar features.
The SARS-CoV2 is reported to be resistant to ultraviolet radiation and the 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% of ethanol, chlorine, pactic acid, chloroform, and other liquids, but not chlorhexidine, can make the virus ineffective.
All people lack immune defenses against SARS-CoV2 and therefore are at risk of developing a new virus.
In the meantime, no detailed research has been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV2.
Therefore, we can only refer to the previous surveys of other Corvs, especially the SARS-CoV and the MESS-CoV (Unfa.4).
Often, after the virus attacks the body, it is first detected by natural receptors that are detected by the ectops (PR), which include receptors such as jet C, receptors like Toll (TLR), receptor like NAD (NLR), and receptor like I (IR).
With different patterns, the virus causes a manifestation of inflammation, the structure of dendritic cells, and the production of interferons of I (IFNs) that speed up the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytics of antigens.
However, SARS-CoV’s protein can help the virus to avoid immune reactions.
Soon, the automatic response of the immune system joins the war against the virus.
T lymphocytes for combining T cells for CD4+ and CD8+ play a vital role in protecting.
The CD4+ T cells encourage the B cells to produce antibodies against the virus, as well as the CD8+ T cells that directly kill infectious cells.
T cells produce proinflamatory cytokines to help protect the protective cells.
However, the COV can prevent T cell activity by producing anoptics of T cells.
The invisibility of the shemoral, including such aids as C3a and C5a and defenses, is also important in the fight against infection.
For example, antibodies taken from a healthy patient render only only only MelS-CoV inactive.
On the other hand, overstimulating the body’s response creates a large proportion of radiation in an area that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other parts of the body, and, in the worst condition, multiple organs and even death.
The SARS-CoV2 disease, which has the first side of the group, has many opportunities to treat the older persons with comorbiditis and pregnant women.
It is not uncommon for people who are exposed to a high level of infection or who have an immune system to attack an infection, and they have a higher chance of getting involved in it than others.
The cause of the SARS-CoV2 incubation period is 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days based on the study of the first 425 people in WUhan.
However, studies of 1,099 people show that the incubation period was 3 days on average and had a width of 0 to 24 days.
Recent studies, as described above, have shown that the incubation period was four.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on the information of 8,866 people.
It is very important for health authorities to change the time of self - imposed vaccinations based on the right amount of incubation period, thus preventing infected but without symptoms from passing the virus on to others.
As is common practice, people who are infected, or infected, need to isolate themselves for 14 days.
Should the locking period be extended 24 days?
The fever is usually a major symptom of COVID-19, which may be incompatible with symptoms such as coughing, loss of breath, muscle pain, nausea, headaches, sore throat, rhinorhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia in one ward after the onset of the disease.
In critical situations, patients rapidly progressed to severe respiratory, hightic shock, metabolic acid, and coaglopathy.
Patients with fevers and/ or critical respiratory symptoms and fevers, even if no unusual features are seen on the map, should be screened for the virus in order to have a first diagnosis.
Human knowledge study conducted at the end of December of 1919 indicated that 98% of the symptoms were fever, 76% of the coughing, 55% of dyspnea, and 3% of diarrhea; 8% needed to breathe with the aid of a machine.
The same find was reported in two recent studies on the family unit as well as the sum total of membership in a nonsigned person.
By comparison, a study of public knowledge in 2012 revealed that the MelS-CoV patients also had a high fever (98%), a coughless cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed to breathe with the aid of a machine, far more than the patients with a COVID-19 and that corresponds to the highest rate of MERS killing than COVID-19.
The diarrhea (26%) and the painful throat (2%) were also mentioned in the MERRS patients.
For SARS patients, it was shown that fevers (99% 100%), mild cough (29-75%), dyspnea (40%42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throats (13-25%) were major symptoms and mechanical breathing was necessary for about 14-20% of patients.
On February 14, the deaths caused by CorVID-19 were 2% when the confirmed patients reached 66.576 worldwide.
By comparison, the deaths caused by SARS in November 2002 are 10% of all confirmed cases of 8,096.
According to MelS, based on research on June 2012, the death toll was 37% for the confirmed 2,494 cases.
The first survey reported that the SARS-CoV2 was high in 6.47 with a level of confidence (CI) of 5.71-7.23, where the SARS-CoV R0 was from 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV 2 with MER-CoV and SARA-CoV for their symptoms, deaths, and R0 is recommended as Table1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-CoV2 has a far higher ability to spread than MESS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has less lethal power than both.
Therefore, it is far more difficult to control the SARS-CoV2 epidemic than the MESS-CoV and the SARS-CoV.
The development of gangs often takes place in the same family or at the same meeting or in the form of a motorboat.
Patients usually have a history of visiting or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients in two weeks earlier.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms longer than two weeks and that abandoned patients who have been discharged from the hospital can still carry the virus again, with the warning to increase the time of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white perepheral blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in early stages.
For example, the lymphopenia has a number of white blood cells called < 4×109/L that includes the lymphocyte number < 1×109/L, as well as the high levels of as ampartate aminotransferrasase and the viremia found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The severity of chronic enzymes and muscles as well as myoglobin were high in the blood of other patients, and C-ental and erythropoietin levels were high in the blood of many patients.
For patients with serious illness, D-dimmer's rate, the production of fibrin decomposition in the blood, was higher, and the number of lymphocytes was significantly reduced.
The unusual finding was in the radiography of many patients with COVID-19 and with the characteristics of the urine with two faces or a ramp of glass or pacity on the lungs.
Patients often suffer from unusual pneumonia, severe lung damage, and acute respiratory disorder (ARDS).
In the event of ARVs, uncontrolled inflammation, growth of fluid, and developing fibrosis put gas in danger.
I-type-I-type pneucocyte lowers the surfacant level and increases the pressure of the upper area, thus reducing the lung capacity to expand and increase the risk of lung fall.
Therefore, the worst effects of radioography are usually similar to the most serious condition of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first tour survey of COVID-19 showed the rise of pneumocytes, the development of the hyyaline membranes, and the advent of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as multicated synaptic cells in the lungs of the patient, which is associated with Pathology and ADHD and the like for SARS and MESS patients.
The discovery of the SARS-CoV2 using reverse-trascriptase polymerase switchedaction (RT-PCR) was used as a major risk factor for a COVID-19 test.
However, because of the high percentage of the wrong virus, which may speed up the epidemic, medical appearances began to be used when testing (not only RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred when SARS tests were being made.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, medical evidence, laboratory tests, and radar effects is important and is essential for successful tests.
On February 14, 2020, a Feng Zhang team described a strategy based on THE UNERLOCK for detecting SARS-CoV2, which finds unusual SARS-CoV2 fragments of SARS-CoV2 in 20 × 10-L/L to 200 × 10-18 ml/L (10-10-100 copies per microliter) using a cross-stick for less than one hour without the most complicated devices.
It is hoped that a new approach will greatly improve empathy and benefits if it is confirmed in medical programs.
Because of lack of experience with new COV, doctors may primarily be able to provide support for the CoviD-19 patients, while trying various forms of treatment that have been used or promoted earlier to be treated by other Corvs like SARS-CoV and only only the ERS-CoV and other viral diseases (The Table2).2.
These treatments include modern treatment and possible antibiotics, emununosuppressants, steroids, plasma from healthy patients, Chinese drugs, and psychological help.
Even a suggestion is made to use the plasma of healthy patients as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to build defenses and antiviral goals.
SARS-CoV2 particularly attacks the lungs at the beginning and likely again, on a small scale, some body parts that indicate ACE2, such as the gastrointensal mast and kidneys.
Nevertheless, poor work and irregular breathing pose a serious threat to patients and is a major cause of death.
Therefore, the support of respiratory support is essential for the prevention of symptoms and health healing and includes regular oxygen treatment, high oxygen flow, air - conditioning, and air - conditioning.
Patients with critical respiratory symptoms should be based on the use of extracurreal membrane oxygen (ECMO), an improved surgical procedure used for cardiopulmonary therapy or life - threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, keeping in terms of the electrolyte record, second birth control and posttic shock therapy, as well as the protection of the active parts of the body are also important to SARS-CoV2 patients.
It is known that the cytokine hurricane is the result of the extreme reaction of the immune system to the SARS and MEORS patients.
The cytokine storm is a reaction to the cytokine system with the release factors of the cytokines of the cytokines, including TNF too, IL-1, L2, LL-6, FN., FN., AFN., and MCP-1.
These cytokines encourage the immune system to release a large number of free radars that are a major cause of ADHD and multiple limbs.
Immune stress is essential to treatment of cytokines, especially for emergency patients.
Corticosteroids as well as toyizub, an anti-L6 monoclonel, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other treatment for the immune system of cytokine involves the control of the immune response directed to the T cell; the prevention of IFN-ADDO, IL-1, and TNF; the hatred of JAK; the litinatumomob; the stresser for the use of cytokine; and the HDAC muscles.
Steroids, such as Immununsuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the risk of inflammation.
However, steroids on a high level did not benefit from severe lung injury to SARS patients and COVID-19.
Rather, it may cause unpleasant side effects, especially the vasectomy, which dramatically interferes with prognosis.
Nevertheless, a short program of corticosteroids in low levels to the middle has been recommended for careful use in the COVID-19 terminally ill patients.
By the time of writing, no effective treatment had been established.
However, remmesiviry, nucleotide alog, was found practical for an American patient with CIVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antibacterial drug first developed by Gilead for treating Ebola and Marlburg infections.
Later, the remdesivir demonstrated that it might have prevented the RNA bacteria in one of the cells that connect the MelS and SARS bacteria.
Based on this, Gilead has given China a framework to conduct studies in persons with SARS-CoV2, and the results are quite obvious.
In addition, bariitinb, interferon-ß, lopinavir/ritonavir, and Ribabilin have been promoted as a possible treatment for patients with critical respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other critical reactions may occur after treating her with the rotor/ritonavir.
The combination of these treatments and other medications used by patients should be considered carefully.
Plasma from healthy patients and the building of defenses
Getting the blood of patients recovering from a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting the disease instead of a long history.
In fact, healthy patients tend to have a high level of immunity against their blood disease.
The immune system is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight disease and other nonprescription factors in the body and is able to see different cells from disease and to render them virtually inactive.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was administered to 10 patients in a crucial way.
Their symptoms were better within 24 hours, which was accompanied by reduced inflammation as well as infection and increased oxygen volume in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed to make the recommendation that the procedure be used widely before a specific treatment can be improved.
Moreover, in view of the side effects of treatment, some of the disadvantages related to plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overexploit the immune response and cause cytokine, which may be life threatening.
The immune volume in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is great for patients to be treated in an emergency.
It is difficult to build and develop certain defenses too quickly to fight a global epidemic.
As a result, it is very important and reasonable to separate the B cells of patients who are correct and to mark genetic codes that have positive genes or that are able to isolate the antibodies that act to represent the important proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase immune reactions.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the combination of multiple parts in different formulas according to the diagnosis based on the TCM concept.
Most of the working parts remain unknown or unclear as it is difficult to select and confirm such well - worked parts or combinations.
In the meantime, because of the lack of active and direct treatment of COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major treatments for patients with less minor symptoms than among those who are recovering in critical stages.
For example, Shu Fung Jie Du pills and Lian Hua Qing Wen were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
High rates of treatment for patients with CIVID-19 were noted in most Chinese states who used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan 50%), while the province of Hubei, which used TCM for about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had a much lower rate of recovery (13%).
This is an incorrect comparison, however, as other factors like the number and severity of patients should be included in review.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and her colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) with WM combination therapy and TCM.
They found that the times required for body temperature to improve, lose symptoms, and hospitalization were shorter in the WM+TM group than only the WM group.
Most interesting, the severity of the symptoms (from the smallest to the most emergency) was significantly lower in the WM+TM team than the WM group (7.4% compared with 46.2%) and the deaths were much lower in the WM+TM class than the WM group only (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, the use and safety of TCM still await careful research at many levels and facilities.
It may also be interesting to note the method of action and make it clear that the effective components of TCM treatment or combinations are available.
Patients with suspicion or confirmed as having COVID-19 often have a high fear of a highly infectious and deadly disease, and those who are in prison are also more likely to be aggressive, lonely, and angry.
In addition, flulike symptoms, hypoxia, and coughing as well as serious side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased stress and mental depression.
In the first stage of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychological - related diseases including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, hyperactivity, delirium symptoms, mental depression, and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
A follow-up for compulsory and closed communication, as part of the public health response to the improvement of COVID-19, may cause many people to feel worried and guilty about the consequences of letting go of the relationship, closing, and burying the family and their friends.
As a result, mental health care should be given to the COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having them, and people with whom they are connected and the community needs.
Mental help should include the development of mental - health centers of many fields of the brain, clear communication with regular and correct responses regarding the development of SARS-CoV2 and treatment programs as well as the use of electrical therapy and programs to avoid close contact with others.
Practical goals are essential to break the chain of contact between animals and humans that may be exposed and often associated with antibiotics in the control of new microbes.
Efforts have been made to achieve goals based on S protocol in order to develop long-term and powerful life-protective defenses and/or protection against SARS-CoV.
Self-controlled goals have been examined in animals in regard to SARS.
However, the workings of living organisms are the applications of these goals for adults as well as their deadly molecules and protection from the virus from animals to humans before the beginning of medical research.
This is because the SARS was silent 17 years ago and no new disease has been reported since then.
On the other hand, less sensitive conditions and groups of MelS continue to appear in the Middle East and spread in other regions as a result of the persistence of bacterial sources from animals to humans in disease areas.
Prevention strategies have been designed for MERS by using noninfected bacteria, DNA plasma, microfossils, nanopartics, bacterial crystals, and synthetic units and some have been tested in animal models.
The building of a safe and effective goal opposite SARS-CoV2 to persons engaged in is an emergency essential in controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to cope with difficulties because of the long period (an average of 18 months) needed to build a goal and changing types of Corvs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full medical program for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover little without the effects of a previous disease.
However, like SARS and MEORS, COVID-19 is also associated with the high rate of illness and death in patients with serious illness.
Therefore, building a model for the cause of the disease is essential to health care services for the introduction of their helpers, especially in areas with small aids.
Based on reported medical studies until now, the following factors may be affected or linked to the cause of the COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the causes of SARS, which is also true in COVID-19.
The COVID-19 arose mainly at 30-65 years and 47.7% of those patients were more than 50 in 8,866 patients' studies as described above.
Patients who needed attention for emergency conditions had a greater chance of being affected by other disorders and disorders and were significantly older than those who did not have (66 compared to 51), which suggests that age is a contributing factor in the impact on patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV2 has caused more males than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Already present and complex diseases: COVID-19 patients who need emergency care have a higher chance of having severe heart attacks and arthythmia.
Heart - related events also became a major cause of the deaths of SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV2 is also capable of sticking to ACE2- postigovive chulacytes, which may lead to liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is good to note that age and illness are already related to strength and may interfere.
The unusual effects of the laboratory: C-reactive protein level (CRP) in the blood shows the risk of inflammation or muscle damage and has been raised as a potential cause of disease, response to treatment, and complete recovery.
There is also a link between the CRP and the crucial cause of COVID-19.
In addition, high lactate dehydrogenese (LDH), aspartate aminoferase (AST), alane aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely shown in many organs, especially in heart and liver, and are released during muscle damage.
As a result, they are common signs of heart failure or liver failure.
Key medical symptoms: chest radiography and the passing of medical symptoms should be considered together with other problems predicted outcomes and the problems of the COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, Immunosuppressant steroids are often used as alternative therapy to reduce the risk of inflammation.
Since the high number of corticosteroids is widely used for patients with severe SARS, the majority of survivors were suffering from a vasectomy with a life disability and a poor quality of life.
As a result, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low and short time for the OVID-19 patients.
Stress: As described above, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients suffered severe depression as they had to endure long periods of isolation and severe uncertainty and experience the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is vital that mental counseling and long - term support be given to help these patients recover from depression and return to normal health.
In accordance with human information studies so far, CorviD-19 appears to have epidemiological characteristics different from SARS.
In addition to re-intervention, SARS-CoV2 can easily multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause little or no symptoms in the first phase of transmission, similar to the Corvs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients who have entered the first stage or the period of pregnancy can produce a large number of infections during daily activities, resulting in a greater difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV infections were thought to occur when patients were very ill, while most infections did not occur in the first stage.
As a result, the outbreak of COVID-19 is more critical and more difficult to control than SARS.
There are many current efforts in China that include the banning of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued closing of the whole population in hopes of hindering the transmission of SARS-CoV2.
While these measures have greatly damaged the economy and other parts of the world, the number of new cases is declining, which suggests a reduction in the rate of epidemics.
The most promising rate is that the shift will end in March and the decrease will continue for 3-4 months.
Some scholars, however, doubt that.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that the COVID-19, which appears to be more interconnected than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Londini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV2 might carry two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV2 was found in both the mid-turbinate tubes and the earlobes of patients who recovered from the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus may have been a double range like a flu.
However, promising signals have come from China based on the dwindling number of young people who are sick, indicating that present plans may be practical.
It had been predicted that Ebola would hold a million people and that half a million people would die.
However, because of strict restraint and isolation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible, as in SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV2 may be weak and eventually eliminated or become a less susceptible to human relations.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MEORS is given below (Unfa.55).
SARS-CoV2 is more susceptible to coughing or sneezes, and it is likely that it is in direct contact with bacterial matter.
The virus was again detected in the wild, which reveals a new chance of transmission from the mouth to the mouth.
A recent study of some 83 patients reported that 41% of the patients may have been admitted to hospitals, including 17 previously afflicted patients and 40 health caregivers.
Hence, much caution should be exercised in order to protect individuals, especially those with health - care, social, family members, friends, and even those standing next to the sick or the vulnerable.
The first line of protection that may be used to reduce the risk of transmission is wearing masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator (inline # 1860s) help control the progression of bacteria.
Simultaneous masks block tiny lymph nodes from a person who may be more likely to walk away from the air and stick to the face, where they can be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (inline #1860s) can prevent you from sniffing 10 to 80 m, while only 5% of the fully able to pass; SARS-CoV2 have the same size as SARS-CoV.
Since bacterials are able to pass through five combination surgical masks, medical surgeons who work directly with patients must wear N95 masks (line # 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health - care surgeons have to wear well - balanced immune globulins to reduce contact with germs.
Germs can enter the human eye.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor contracted SARS-CoV2 even though he was wearing N95 masks; the virus may have entered his body by entering his eyes and waking up.
Hence, health - care surgeons also need to wear masks that cannot show or mirrors when operating patients.
In the general community of affected or affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with soaps that are fired more often than usual, try to stay indoors to keep in touch and to avoid contact with potential travelers.
A three - step walk is considered the ideal distance for people to get away from patients.
These measures are practical ways to reduce the risk of infection and to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV2 came as a new virus in the world of mankind, its holding the same structure as SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should be a Chinese warning because it still remembered the SARS outbreak in 2003.
Until 19, January 2020, however, the director of the Center of Disease Control in Wuhan convinced citizens that the new virus can be small and relatively small receptors when it is passed from person to person and that it is not a problem to prevent and control disease.
This message kept the public safe, especially when the whole country prepared for the Spring Festival, and they missed the crucial time to control the virus before it reached Wuhan.
Chinese disease control ratings may learn from this crucial lesson and make important progress in the future.
For example, these websites should (1) be more careful when making public declarations as each term is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) they are more sensitive and more responsive to unusual information from a health clinic than they are waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) they may prevent further damage to him during the first stage instead of trying to comfort the community; and (4) they are more likely to improve public awareness concerning diseases that have ended and can be tested and improved at certain times.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV2 virus at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world by the time it was written.
Since the virus is much like SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a feeling that SARS are repeating.
However, there is a significant difference between COVID-19 and SARS, which is vital to control the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
The COVID-19 affects more people who are older and more male than women, and the risk and mortality rate is higher for adults than for young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared with 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they do not have symptoms while the SARS patients transmit it when they become more ill, causing an even greater problem with the improvement of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV2 is increasing faster and more rapidly than SARS-CoV.
The general assessment of SARS-CoV2 RNA may be very aggressive to some patients of COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients who have been treated may also be more prone to infections.
This discovery greatly increases the risk of infection infection infection.
With the rapid progress of the COVID-19 research, there remain a few serious problems that need to be solved, including:
Where does SARS-CoV 2 come from?
Although it found that 96% of the genetic structure between SARS-CoV2 and two SARS bats, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV2 is emerging from bats.
What animal was in the middle of the area that transmitted the virus from the first pond, say to bats, to people?
If we don't know the answers for#1 and 2, we cannot successfully cross the transfer, and the relapse can be worse at any time.
Although cell models and biochemic analysis have shown that SARS-CoV2 adheres to ACE2, how does the virus actually enter the respiratory cells and cause the changes that cause the result?
Does the virus return to the cells that show ACE2 in other parts of the body?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot reach any early and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How do the genes of the virus change during human contact?
Will it become a global plague, will it end like SARS, or will it become worse from time to time like a cold?
It is important, but it may take some time to find the answers to the above questions and a host of other questions.
Regardless of the cost, however, we have no choice other than to prevent the epidemic as quickly as possible and to restore our health to normal conditions.
The roots of the virus from animals to humans of the solar system
The change and adapting has encouraged the co-evolution (CoVs) and its liquid, which include people, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two People (HCoVs) were known as causing minor illnesses, such as the common cold.
The outbreak of an vete respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (IMERS) has changed the situation to show how much damage HCOV disease can cause and how much life threatening.
The appearance of SARS-CoV2 in central China at the end of 1920 also set the Corvs in the theater and surprised us with a high rating but with a reduced parathogenicity compared with her SARS-CoV.
HCOV is zonosis, and understanding the origin of HCOV’s zoological roots can help.
Most HCOVs come from bats and cause no illness from them.
Those in the middle of some HCOVs are also known.
Coordination of ignorant animals has a direct effect on the prevention of human diseases.
Research on animals for the use of the CV can produce important insights about the makeup of the CoV in humans.
In this review, they present a summary of the already available information about the seven HCOVs, and it will focus on the history of their discovery and their zoological origins and interconnection.
More important, we compare and split different HCOVs according to the theory of bacterial and genetic mutations.
The current COV-19 epidemic (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful treatment and the effects of bacterial changes in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) are part of the Coronavidae family, made up of a bacterial group that is closed, sensitive, with a single RNA.
These bacteria contain the largest geometry of 26 to 32 kilobases between the RNA bacteria called "CoVs" because of their crownlike microscopic bacteria under the electron microscope.
As a rule, Corvs with no geometrys have the same order.
About three quarters of the geometry contain two large floating frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), translated to be replicase polyproteins of ppp1a and p1ab.
The polyproteins are further tested to build 16 additional non-built proteins, called pp1 ~16.
The remaining portion of the geometry contains UrF proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
The number of polynomial proteins also has a code of different CV ranges.
Based on the sequence of proteins, Corvs are classified in four categories (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the form of beta-CoV contains a number of HCVs and divided into four categories (A, B, C, C and D).
The evidence of phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and mice are the source of alpha-CoV genes and beta-CVs, while birds are the source of gammaCVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have progressively passed over the boundaries of creatures and most of them have become the most important pethogens in humans.
So far, seven people (HCOVs) are known.
Among them HCoV229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five positives include HCoV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, respiration syndrome (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respirary syndrome (MYS-COV) and SARS-CoV2.
HCoV229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause minor symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MER-CoV and SARS-CoV2 recently discovered cause serious illness, causing an acute respiratory disease in so many patients, causing a high chance of a higher recovery of respiratory radiation syndrome (ARDS) and other diseases that occur outside the lungs.
The first form of HCoV229E, B814, was divided from the noses of normal cold patients in the mid-60s.
Since then, more information has been obtained about more HCoV229E research and HCV-OC43, both causing these resulting signals.
In fact, the view was adopted that HCOV cases are usually harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 is one of the sadest in modern history, causing more than 8,000 cases of illness and about 10% of deaths.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a continuing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, which is occurring from time to time in other parts of the world.
The new HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV2, is the cause of the ongoing epidemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,20 people and contributed to more than 91,000 persons by March 3,20.
The alarm has been crying and the world should be ready for the coming plague of SARS-CoV2.
All seven HCOVs are derived from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Much of the evidence supports the origin of the evolution of all HCOVs from bats, where bacteria adapt well and do not cause illness but demonstrates a wide range of genetic differences.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented serious medical, scientific, social, and social challenges in China and the world.
Tracking the origin of HCOV’s zoological origin provides a framework for understanding the natural history, dynamic energy and reproductive features of the jumping of life.
This can also guide or help to consider the cause, middle and design of SARS-CoV2 seals, which will have a significant impact on future transmission control.
In this review the introduction of zoological origins, interconnected organisms and HCOV's parathogenes.
Especially, we feature and discuss the same unit that the HCOV’s parent viruses often cause no illness in their natural pool but cause illness after a combination of various creatures and new swamps.
We also reverse the HCOV revolution in which the increase in transmission usually occurs and the reduction of parathogenicity.
The effects of SARS-CoV2 further are discussed in this context.
Animal Corvs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first division of HCoV29E, B814 from the noses of patients who had received the common cold, separate CVs were separated from a variety of animals, including galik, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
Over the past decades, seven HCOVs have been discovered.
A brief summary of the history of HCOV access in its sequence (Tab 1) may be beneficial and educational.
The first form of HCoV229E was divided into the respiratory system for upper respiratory patients in 1906, and was adopted to develop in the WWI 38 lungs cells.
HCoV229E patients had symptoms of normal cold, which included headaches, sneezes, laise and sore throat, and fever and coughs were seen in 10,~20%.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 separated the organ of the tissue and the sequence of the next sequence in the brain of the lymph nodes.
The medical aspects of HCoV-OC43 seem to be the same as those caused by HCoV229E, which was not distinguished by symptoms in the transmission of other respiratory diseases such as influenza A virus and rinoviruses.
Both HCoV229E and HCoV-OC43 are global, and it is usually associated during the winter season in good weather.
Usually, the incubation period for the two is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy HCoV229E sufferers are exposed to mild flu.
Only a few patients with depression have shown an acute respiratory disorder.
SARS, also known as the "manomonia", was the first recorded HCOV plague in human history and the commission responsible for SARS-CoV, the third HCOV discovered.
The first SARS disease can be traced up to the end of 2002 in China’s Guangdong Province.
The SARS epidemic led to a report of 8,096 cases and 774 deaths, which are spread in many countries and continents.
With the exception of the main operators, it was estimated that each incident could cause at least two more accidents, during a four - to 7-day incubation period and that the rise of the virus volume appeared on the 10th day of illness.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially seemed to suffer from dyalgia, headaches, fever, malaria and flu, followed by dyspnea, coughing and respiratory stress as later symptoms.
The lymphopenia, the wrong liver test, and the high creatine kinase are among the most common laboratory products because of SARS.
The spread of anal effect, the explosion of epethal cell, and the rise of macrophages are noted in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients need emergency care and oxygen installation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many body organs involving the gastroins, liver, and kidney can also be susceptible to these critical conditions, often accompanied by cytokine, which can kill especially patients with antibodies.
The virus was first isolated from open lung surgery by a relative of the first patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, extensive efforts have been made in connection with HCOV research.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a child of 7 months in the Netherlands towards 2004.
At first it was found to be grown in young children, elderly people, and patients with respiratory infections.
Coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchioliitis are common in HCOV-NL63 disease.
One independent study described the partitioning of the same virus from the liver of an eight - month - old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was found in the Netherlands, it is, in fact, worldwide.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of normal respiratory infections, and its high incidence occurs early in summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with oprusive radiation, also known as macrop.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old male who was admitted to the Neumonia and bronchioliitis hospital in Hong Kong.
In addition to the common pneumonia and bronchiolitics, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthmatic integrity.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCoV29E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was found around the world, causing small respiratory infections.
All these HCOVs are found in the community and are generally less likely to change to become high - risk parathogenic diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons as in the unusual condition of a highly lethal HCV-NL63 type, reported to cause serious respiratory disease in China.
Often, when HCOVs develop the ability to absorb easily and keep themselves in a constant state within humans, they also kill or become less parathogenic.
MelS-CoV was first separated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient who had severe pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the guaranteed cases are from the Middle East, introduced conditions are spreading to local contacts reported in various European and Tunisia countries.
Another second outbreak took place in South Korea in 1915 with 186 confirmed incidents.
The medical appearance of MelS is similar to that of SARS, which is characterized by a progressive pneumonia.
In contrast with SARS, most cases of ChristS have a serious kidney failure, which is currently different from MERS among HCOV - related diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastroinstinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Since February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases of corvettes with high death factors have been reported by 34.4%, making the MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous bacteria in the population.
From mid-December 2019 to its end, many patients with pneumonia known as SARS-CoV2 were diagnosed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization called the outbreak of sub - respiratory syndrome created by SARS-CoV2 as the State Health Emergency of the World and named the disease COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, it was reported that there were 90,053 reported cases worldwide, with 3.4% death rates.
Significantly, the death toll in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the other outside is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV2 causes severe respiratory disease such as SARS-CoV and MERV, which has been introduced as fever, coughing, and dyspnea.
Patients also suffer from diarrhea.
The pneumonia is one of the most critical symptoms and can rapidly develop into a system of respiratory disease syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 are almost identical because of the same high order of nucleotide as 82%, there are different groups in the branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV2 looks less pathogenic but is more related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It is reported that there are people who do not have symptoms with SARS-CoV2 and may be contributing to its rapidly spreading around the world.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV 2 with six other HCOVs constitutes a more interesting difference.
For one thing, the incubation period and the length of time of HCOV’s progression are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV2 follows the normal rent of six other HCOVs.
Secondly, the focus of the COVID-19 signals is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs received from the community (HCoV229E, HCoV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV 2 indicates common symptoms during HCV infections, which include absence of clear symptoms, minor symptoms or absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a minimum set of COVID-19 emergency conditions can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV, although the average level is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV2 communicate also shows interesting carpets with both HCOV and SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, the transfer of SARS-CoV2 is as high as the HCoVs received from the community.
On the other hand, it will still be certain that SARS-CoV2 transfers will be reduced to people as in the SARS-CoV situation and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCOVs, SARS-CoV2 can be found in the domestic samples.
Whether SARS-CoV2 transmission plays an important role when it comes to SARS-CoV under certain circumstances will still be discussed by future research.
It is also of great interest to see whether SARS-CoV2 will indicate an appearance at certain seasons of the year as are the HCOVs found in the community.
Nevertheless, the SARS-CoV2 factors that include its in-intervention, parathogenicity, and sustainable development after transfer to humans will affect the final conclusion of the continue recovery of COVID-19.
All HCoVs found in the community cause little symptoms and better socialization.
According to one theory, it may also be true that people are well adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both might have survived the ancient HCOV plague.
HCOV causes serious disease in humans and people with serious HCOV diseases are no longer present.
To accomplish this, HCoVs must repeat to the people enough enough to allow the growth of changes that occur in accordance with the aspects of the urinary pregnancy.
In this way, if the SARS-CoV2 outbreaks persist and joins more people, there will be a great chance that it will become more friendly with people.
If he adapts so well, his participation may be difficult to halt by closing or other methods of transmission.
For many years, four CoVs have been found in the community around the public, causing common cold among people with proper immune response.
These bacteria need no animal source.
On the contrary, the SARS-CoV and the IMS-CoV of the giant pleasure-CoV are no longer well compatible with humans and their internal connections cannot be maintained.
They need to keep themselves in shape and grow in their source of the magnetic field and seek opportunity to pass on to the victims who can be affected, almost one half or more of them and raise the ignorant.
SARS-CoV2 has features similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCOVs found in the community.
It is as highly accessible as HCOVs found in the community, at least as the first creature.
However, more popogenic than HCOVs are found in the community and has less parathogenic in SARS-CoV or MERMS-CoV.
It is still going to be determined whether it will fully adapt to humans and orbit outside the center of the animal’s well or water source.
Before discussing the origin of HCOV animals, it will help us to discuss the explanations and features of the nonevolution, natural, source, and HCOV magnifyers.
An animal becomes a HCOV revolution if it harbors a closely related cork relative to its mate with a homology high in the order of nucleotide.
Coral bacteria usually adapt well and do not cause illness in the lake.
Similarly, a source of water still holds HCoV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the ignorant are naturally transmitted and are not natural HCOV's or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCOV is reintroduced to a medium - middle or toward the introduction of humans, it is well adapted to a new pill and often causes illness.
This central fluid may be a source of zoological human transmission and play the role of raising an eagle that allows the virus to multiply for brief periods and to be transmitted to the people for the increase of human transmission.
HCoV can cope with the final transmission if it is able to maintain its flow inside the centre of water.
On the contrary, HCoVs are able to adjust to a medium - size shark and even develop a long - term telepathy.
In this case, the central gouge becomes a natural source of water.
A detailed epidemiological data showed that in retrospect it is considered that the SARS patient had a history of contact with hunted animals.
The next study of repulatory studies showed that animal traders had an IgG anti-SARS-CoV as high as the average population.
Masked palm civets (papapavata larvata) and a racon dog in the markets of living animals were found to carry germs like SARS-CV that are almost like SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no additional SARS was reported after the murder of all the cuvets in the market.
It has been reported, however, that the boom palm civets in the wild or on farm never reported in the market of living animals were highly aggressive when it comes to SARS-CoV, which suggests that masted palm civets may be a central supporter but not a natural source of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy, that 80 percent of the various animals in Guangzhou’s market have anti-SARS-CoV defenses, we cannot ignore the possibility that many mammals are not the losers of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the final lack of SARS-CoV.
A subsequent study of this natural animal of SARS-CoV produced a coV closely related to a bat, called SARS-related Rhinolopus bov HKU3 (SARSR-R-R-Bat Corv HK3), which is found in Chinese horse-boats.
These bats are very sensitive when it comes to the immune system against SARS-CoV and the sequence of SARSR-Rh-BatCK3 genes.
This together with other batnelic Corvs that account for 88-92% of the complex nucleotide and SARS-CoV.
These studies have led to the development of the new theory that bats are posing a threat to man’s new pathogens.
Corvs like SARS (SL-CVs) are marked on bats, but they are not except for the one called WIV1 that can be classified as a living virus.
Human Angiotsin conning enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV assignment.
The WIV1 samples taken from the insect's sewage has been shown to use bats, civets and ACE2 humans as a delivery to the cell.
Interestingly, the AIDS epidemic of patients recovered from SARS was able to kill VV1.
Thus far, the WIV1 represents the closely related ancestor SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence.
Although there is a high level of homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that VIV1 is not the nearest parent virus SARS-CoV and bats that contained the nearby SARS-CoV virus.
The analysis of phylogenetics includes MERS-CoV and a group similar to the Corv-HKU4 bat and the CV-HKI5 bat.
The Corv-HKU4 bats and the MERS-CoV use the same diesel reactor, dipypyl perpidase 4 (DPP4), in bacterial infection.
The RNA-based RNA-CoV polymerase unit is closely related to the phylogenetical forces of the beta-CoV bats discovered in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV is found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative CorV-HKU25 of the bat share only 87% of the subsectional nucleotide.
As a result, bats may not be the nearest source of MEORS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels from a seropostory are directly in the immune system, similar to camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
A live MERS-CoV like a human virus was separated from the camel’s nose tube, which further showed that camels are the true source of the MERMS-CoV.
It is also remarkable that it was usually seen in small cases but a large release of the virus to the ERS-CoV via a study.
It is noteworthy, that more than a handful of camels not only remove the bacteria through the respiratory tract but also through the mouth of the mouth, which is also the primary channel for the removal of the virus from bats.
Questions remain, however, since most of the MERS disease has no history of communicating with camels before the onset of symptoms, it may be that contact from person to person or of unknown interconnections involving unknown animals that incubate the MEORS-CV.
SARS-CoV2 shared the nucleotide comology of 96.2% with the CV RaTG13 bat divided from the Rhinolopus affinis bat.
As with SARS-CoV and MEORS-CoV, the successive variations between SARS-CoV2 and RaTG13 are too large to be assigned to parent relations.
That means, bats may have had the nearest source of SARS-CoV2 unless nearly identical bats are discovered.
It is estimated that, in the midst of the SARS-CoV2 wildlife, they should be among the animals sold and killed at the Huanan Seaped Whoolale Market, most of them associated with the first oviD-19 disease, which suggests there may have been a corvée from humans.
A few recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of small mammals known as barin (Manis javanica) may be incubating old basta-CoV related to SARS-CoV2.
These new gnomes of the barin COV count 85-92% of the numleotide sequence and SARS-CoV2.
However, they are relatively closely related to RATG13 by about 90% in the order of nucleotide.
They meet to be two subdivisions of about SARS-CoV2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares the background of a relatively similar distribution (RBD) and SARS-CoV2, with a succession of amino acid.4%.
In sharp contrast, the SARS-CoV 2 RATG13 RBDs are quite different, though there is a high degree of extensive commuting.
Early research of sick lalolins reported the discovery of micrologic contraceptives in the lungs, which appears to be similar to SARS-CoV2.
The study used various forms of construction and hand-made planning to form a sequence of a partial geometry made up of about 86.3% of the total length of the micromeme.
We cannot set aside the chance that a lalolin is one of the nearby live creatures of SARS-CoV2.
In the meantime, however, there is no evidence to support that a lalolin is the correct origin of SARS-CoV2 because of successive variations between SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV2 of the laidlin related to beta-CoV.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV2 and RATG13 is much shorter between SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV2 of the rainbow related to the beta-CoV.
The cycle of SARS-CoV2 in bats, labarins and other mammals is still going to be discovered.
Although high-orderly Homology has been found in RBD between SARS-CoV2 and barlin, SARS-CoV2 related to beta-CoV, SARS-CoV 2 and RaTG13 share a higher mutine sequence.
There are high charges that the high rate of RBs-CoV2 coV 2 of the bar related to beta-CoV and SARS-CoV2 is driven by the choice of interconnecting.
Another recommendation recommends reunification between SARS-CoV2 of a joint related to beta-CoV and RaTG13 on the third wild animal.
As a force that continues to change, reunification is widespread among the beta-CoVs.
The conclusion has not yet been reached regarding the origin of the nearby SARS-CoV 2.
In addition to HCOV very high pothogenics, the origin of HCOV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
The evidence of phylogenic has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV29E may have been introduced to bats, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were discovered from rats.
It is reported that an ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) discovered in a three-color North American bat showed close contact with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV29E was genetically related to another bat’s Corv, called Hipposes/GhanaWam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while the calamids have been accused of being its nearest guide.
To clarify it, current knowledge about the origin of known HCOV animals is summarized in diagram 1 and Table 2.
The analysis of phylogenic has given evidence of HCOV contact conditions in history.
When HCoV-OC43 moved from one animal to man from domestic animals about 1890, a respiratory epidemic was recorded.
The HCoV229E life history is not quite clear.
We have discovered bat-CoV related HCoV29Eals.
Among them is the alpha-CoV alpha of alphaaca.
Few evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats directly to humans.
First of all, humans, not alpicas, may communicate with bats in the same environment.
Rather, people are closer to the Altacas.
Secondly, bat-CoVs related to HCoV29E are different and do not cause disease in bats, while the alpaca's alpha-Covic has caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alpha-CoV has not yet been found in wild animals.
As a result, we will not overlook the possibility that the alpacas receive an alpha-CoV related HCV29E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of germs that cause human infections that include the rabbi virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus, and the Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV229E to people.
On the other hand, when the alpha-CoVs function as a group of HCOV29E genes, the alpacas as well as dromedary camels may be a midmediate agent that transmits the virus to humans, as is the case with MERS-CoV.
MERSS-CoV is a good example of intercommunclementation between species from bats to people.
The origin of the MEDS-CoV mutations from bats is known for its first attempts and is strengthened by the following findings.
Clearly, bats provide a host of microorganisms that offer opportunity for genetic exchanges between different animals and different types of animals.
Long health, crowded colonies, close social ties, and the ability to fly all are ideal conditions for bats to become a good ‘ infectious agent ’.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced to a camel from a damdary for centuries.
It is well - suited to these camels to turn into a medium - sized duck that becomes a stable and natural source of water.
MelS-CoV causes less disease and lowers the rate of change in these animals.
Its access to humans is a mistake and people remain the last layer of MERC-CoV as its transfer cannot be maintained.
In contrast with the role of camels in the transfer of the MEORS-CoV, the role of labarins, if available, in the SARS-CoV2 delivery is different.
Particularly, the bota-Cov lalolins cause severe illness in the barlins.
They may be the last available beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV2, like coves in the SARS-CoV state.
SARS-CoV 2 from animals to humans should be considered or considered in future research.
First, bats may be a source of SARS-CoV2 related to SARS-CoV2 similar to SARS-CoV2.
People may play the same role with bats by performing animal or coal drills.
Secondly, lalolins may be a magnifying liquid in the middle where the SARS-CoV2 - related virus has recently been introduced.
People are being infected by surgery and by eating meat.
It is possible that many reptiles, including domestic animals, can be exposed to SARS-CoV2.
A survey of animal and wild animals is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the reunification and recognition of SARS-CoV2 may occur in a third animal connected with both bats and galins.
SARS-CoV2 conservation continues.
Apart from the variety of animal ignorances, there are three major factors on the side of the virus that are vital to the ability of the CoVs to cross the boundaries of the species.
First, their high number of changes in RNA repeats.
Compared with other RNA bacteria having a single strip, the average number of CV changes may be viewed as "less" in terms of the "higher" changes of ~10-4 each year for each of the 2 units, depending on the CV coordinates for the new memory.
Corvs have exoribnucle errors, their removal results in very high changes and loss of energy or ability to develop properly.
Interestingly, nucleotic nalogue Remdesivir is known to suppress the repeal of the Corv by preventing this choribnucle and RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising trials against SARS-CoV2 for medical research.
Nevertheless, the number of Corv changes is about a million higher than those that are not otherwise.
In addition, the number of changes is usually higher if the COV is not fully compatible with the ice.
Compared with SARS-CoV with a higher rate of change, the number of SARS-CoV2 change appears to be lower, suggesting a higher level of socialization.
Supposedly, it may already have been recommended by another man - made tiger.
In addition to SARS-CoV2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which fits closely with dromedary camels.
It is thought that it is unlikely that genetic mutations could cause the goals and antibiotics against SARS-CoV2 to be ineffective.
Secondly, a large RNA in the Corvs uses more flexibility in the replacement and recombination of the geometry, thus increasing the possibility of co-evolution, which is beneficial for the development of new Corvs when conditions are in motion.
This is supported by many different different reading frames and the use of a protein produced by the third end of the geometry.
Thirdly, permanent Corvs change samples in random order during RNA repeats in the different manner of "copying".
In a liquid that acts as a blender, a change of type occurs regularly during the CV RNA transscript.
Too long homologous RNAs with full length and subgenonomic may reunite to build new Corvs.
Evidence of natural reunification has been found in both HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and animal Corvs such as the SL-CoV bat and the barCOV-HKU9.
Integrated Epilepsy
In addition to the three aspects of the virus mentioned above, contact with the virus’s hostel is another major factor that has a bearing on the interaction of different creatures.
Here, a reunification of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which showed evidence of extreme selection during interconnection events.
Based on contrasting analysis between people separated and SARS-CoVs in covet, it is thought that SARS-CoV is subject to rapid flexibility in different options, especially with changes in SBD on S protocol.
Usually, RBD in a Corv protocol cooperates with the cell transfer and is carefully selected for the immune system's response.
For SARS-CoVs, RBD is in 398 amino acids to 510 of the S1 part, which adheres to a person's ACE2 and its coreceptors to enter the virus.
The SARS-CoV RS are able to identify ACE2 different animals, including bats, civets, rats, and raccoons, which allow the bacterial contact of different creatures.
In fact, only 6 remains of amino acids marked as separate from the human virus and 4 of which are found in a motif that adheres to the agent to deal with the ACE2 assignment.
SARS-Cov has a K479N change and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the level of contact between the Spike protein and the ACE2 public health unit.
In other words, this change of two amino acids may be essential to human transmission.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV2 has the same cell distribution as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV 2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protocol S1 means that the level of S protein combination of S and ACE2 persons may have changed.
In fact, EM research shows a high degree of curve 10-to 20 – of this curve rather than between ACE2 people and SARS-CoV's prognosis.
It will also be of interest to determine whether further accounting is required in the SARS-CoV2 connection.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also attached to ACE2 but with a different S component.
There are other HCOV distributions, such as the aminoptics N in HCoV29E, and 9-O-acetated salic acid HCoV-OCC3.
They may also be viewed as a reason for the successful link between the CoVs to humans after contact with different creatures from their animal waste.
In addition to cells, the result of HCOV combinations of different organisms is recontrolled by dependence on another creature and the end properties.
The variety of these prognosis between humans and strangers that are not a natural source of HCOV as bats, dromedary camels, and rats may result in a combination of different species.
HCOVs should take the characteristics of dependence on the owner and interfere with the characteristics of the whale's halting so that there is a successful interconnection of species.
In this regard, cell resolutions in this vital area are still going to be identified and marked.
The extensive analysis of the genome's non-utilisation and SARS-CoV2 synthesis by using modern CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCOV output: return to
The variety of bat Corvs provides many opportunities for new HCOVs.
In this sense, bats have served as a collection of HCOV genes.
In addition, rapid changes and reuniting of genes continue the HCOV transition and serve as two vital steps in this process.
For example, the discovery or loss of the genes that make up a new protein code has the power to dramatically change the virus’sphanotypes.
Among the key proteins in SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to be important in socialization, since bats related to SARS-CoV are separated but found producing different OF8 proteins.
The characteristic of SARS-CoV removal of 29-nucleotides is found in different types at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal separates the ORF8 from ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an automatic change that encourages the conversion of the ignorant.
Besides, SARS-CoV may have a history of recognising with the tables of the Alpha and gamma, where a large number of subdivisions were discovered from the RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Recontamination facilities were recovered from Sp9, for a large part of the sp10, and for parts of the sp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic met events of reuniting among the various categories, which took place in Saudi Arabia camel.
Apart from SARS-CoV and MEORS-CoV, instances of reunification have been noted in other HCOVs, where HCOVs reunite other animal Corvs in their genes without a building.
It should also be recognized that artificial selection may contribute to unexpected changes in the immune system, which may result in the release of bacteria from the stress of choice used, such as that of the immune system.
An example of these results is the loss of the double-length of the HCoV29E model, due to the removal of the double nucleotide.
Although the complete ORF4 was seen in bat and camel related to HCoV29E, the alpaca's alpha-CoV indicates the installation of a single nucleotide, leading to the change of the frame.
Finally, but important, the HCOV changes are retributed by the pressure to choose from its sources.
There were no signs or only minor symptoms found when bats were transmitted with the CVs, showing a similar link between the Corv and bats.
It seems that bats are well suited to the Corvs according to structure and operation.
For example, reactions that encourage inflammation in bats are easily reduced by the compasses that the CVs are introduced.
Besides, the function of the natural killer cell against bats is stressed because of the increase in the response of the immune system of NKG2/CD94 and the low rate of exposure of the cells of the I complex shistocodentity.
In addition, the high level of oxygen-inflammation (ROS) built by a high - food processing task may affect both the pressure of the CoV repeat and affect the testing of error with exoribinoclease, thus giving the pressure to select more potogenic forms when they are introduced to the new species.
The most effective metogenic types of CoV may also be altered by recombination, leading to the discovery of new proteins or protein properties for refrigeration.
As a result, it is not just a surprise that three new HCOVs have developed in the last two decades.
Corvs do not get sick or cause minor symptoms to their main disadvantages like bats and camels.
They abruptly relapse without encouraging a strong immune reaction.
Here are the secrets of why carriers who have no symptoms are identified and what is behind critical conditions in people’s illness.
The most serious symptoms are caused mainly by the multiple antibodies and by the cytokine storm when there is strong immune reactions, the damage to the lungs is much greater.
In contrast, for those who do not show symptoms, the immune reaction has been twice separated from the increase of the CV.
The same tactic of dividing immune reactions may have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV2.
The interferon reaction is particularly strong for bats.
As a result, the use of interferon I at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV2 transmission to people should be beneficial.
Moreover, the use of NLRP3 inflammasomes for bats is invalid.
According to this opinion, NLRP3 inflammasome with MC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV 2 follows a regular SARS-CoV unit and MERS-CV.
Although the bat's beta-CoV is discovered that shared by 95% of nucleotide homology and SARS-CoV, there is also an femin of the bat which shares 96% of nucleotide homology and SARS-CoV2.
Although civets and other market animals have been found to harbor germs such as SARS-CoV, nearby sARS-CoV2 strangers have not yet been discovered.
The discovery of the beta-Cobarlins has a structure similar to SARS-CoV2, which indicates that the lalolins may be some of the mid-detectables or the beta-CoV-Callins may have a hand in the genetic component of the last SARS-CoV2 version.
While the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV2 is deliberately or indirectly built.
The Corvs have returned to the theater because of the recent SARS-CoV2 outbreaks.
The study of CoVs and other animals has greatly influenced our view of the importance of the origin of the zoological origin and the animal sources of HCOV in human contact.
The widespread evidence shows that the SARS-CoV, the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 are of bat origin and is passed on by middle ignorant people.
Since SARS-CoV is derived from contact between people and covets in the market, closing the markets of living animals and killing civets could have ended the SARS epidemic.
By the same reasoning, lalolins should be taken out of the biological markets to prevent the zoological flow, considering the discovery of many beta-CoV columns in the alolin closely related SARS-CoV2.
However, how and how SARS-CoV2 is passed to people in lalolins and other mammals will still be reported in future research.
On the other hand, the ERS-CoV has always been there for the camel in a damdary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, honey, skin, and yellow products to the local people.
They are widely scattered throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to kill all the camels to control MEORS, as did China’s wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV 2.
In order to prevent a relapse of MERS, a more detailed method must be used to build effective goals against the ORS-CoV of the camel, which is accompanied by other measures of control of disease.
Since we cannot eliminate these bacteria, new genotypes may appear to cause inflammation.
The variety of zootic Corvs rotates in the wilderness.
In particular, bat Corvs have a vast variety of zootic energy.
There are many possibilities for these zootic Corvs to change and reunite, which will result in more interconnected and/or death of humans in the future.
The custom of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS events, the ERS and the COVID-19, there should be a better method of preparation and response.
In fact, most bacteria have developed over a long period of time on earth.
They live in their natural habitats until they have opportunity to leave.
Although fruit bats have many characteristics that promote the spread of germs, the chance that humans can communicate with bats and other wild animals can be eliminated if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continued care of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the COV and its natural predators, which will be useful in preventing the passing of animals from humans and in future outbreaks.
When it does, the best way to prevent zonosis is to keep people away from the natural source of zootic bacteria.
A few parts of the SARS-CoV2 cause puzzles are not yet found.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV2 native to the lalolins, it will be beneficial to see what conditions the bats and the labarins are able to share with each other the environment.
Second, if bats play a very specific role in human migration, they should be identified with how humans communicate with bats.
Third, if the mammal acts as a true medium - sized fluid, the way it interacts with a variety of creatures that include humans, bats, and gloins should be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals as well as domestic animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV2, both the monitoring and the flow of research should be done.
If it is a bat, a lalolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV2 or its almost similar parent viruses will be found in its natural water supply in the future.
Further research in this area will explain the range of SARS-CoV2 conversions to animals, and the important results of the preventing and control of the COVID-19 people.
A review of the case of those who are "accused" and "confirmed" that they are affected by CIVID-19 requires that they are
On February 6, 2020, our team had published a summary of the early diagnosis and transmission therapy of the new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and this version provided our experience as well as a suitable guide for the global plague.
However, the 1990 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and understanding increase based on ongoing research and experience of treatment procedures; that is why, testing techniques and treatment continue to be criticized.
In this book, we answered one comment about our method and gave a new look for those who are "accused" and "confirmed" that they are sick according to Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new Coronavirus of 1990 (2019-nCoV) had caused outbreaks, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named a respirary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2).
In 11 March 2020, WHO referred to the COVID-19 as a plague.
In order to fight the SARS-CoV2 transmission, our team has established a method of rapid response and printed on the Miriam Medical Research in 06 February 2020.
It has received much attention since it was printed.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, awareness and awareness increase based on research and medical experience; hence, testing techniques and treatment continue to be postponed.
For example, the Diannosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http:/www.hc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, has issued seven volumes when other things were altered.
Our calendar received a comment from Zou et al., present a simple summary based on their experience.
Their work adds to the new evidence of our galaxy and made an important reference to this plague worldwide.
We commend them for their valuable work and express our gratitude.
However, their developer needs to be revised in accordance with the Dipnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (September of Research) and later research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to ensure the diagnosis of a suspected illness requires that any one of the aspects of epidemiological history and two of the medical evidence for general analysis, or that it requires to meet three types of medical evidence that have no specific history of epidemiological records:
The history of epidemiological: (1) the history of visiting or living in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other societies where the COVID -19 has been reported for the 14 days before the beginning of the symptoms; (2) the history of contact with people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV2 (by the unacleic acid examinations of fever or symptoms in the city of Wiuhan and the surrounding environment); (3) the history of communication with other communities where the COVID-19 days prior to the early symptoms; (4) the history of meeting with a number of multiple patients who have been able to be able to communicate with each other patients at the schools, such as the schools, such as the schools, may have been at home.
Medical appearances: (1) fever and/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) which have features in the picture of the introduction of COVID-19; (3) the total number of white blood cells that indicate the normal, low, or low, number of lymphocytes in the first paragraph.
The diagnosis of a confirmed disease should be based on the one suspected of the following criteria of Papogenic or sterological evidence: (1) the critical PCR test of the real time SARS-CoV2; (2) the complete immune sequence of the homogengengenity that indicates high in the known coronavirus bacteria; (3) the loss of self-infection of the IgM as well as an Ig SARS-CoV2 immune from an internal control; or the direct control of the SGS coV 2 of the SAR virus from the SAR virus, it is going to develop more than 5 times.
We see that real time tests of Nucleic acidic PCs in the respiratory system or blood samples are related to the second processes (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
The discovery of the pathogenic blood sample for the world's four sets (27 January 2020) and five (8 February 2020); and the testoological evidence is included in the seventh edition.
These changes based on the ongoing research activity of research for the discovery of high - quality nucleic acid scans, as well as airway samples that include the sample of blood, which promoted the availability of different tissues, and supported the introduction of the final effect of the immune system on the confirmed matter.
Besides, there is additional evidence to remind us that we are alert to patients with unusual symptoms and those without symptoms.
Hence, Zou et al's guide chart. It should be repeated, since it refers to a person who has no medical symptoms as a "substance risk".
The process of analysis also requires confirmation at work and in continued medical studies.
In conclusion, we hope that there is more evidence to come and ask that the students identify.
In order to make a test of the "professing" and the "criminations," we recommend that they be followed and laid up new international journals in their home.
Our army will also return our path to offer help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths caused by COVID-19, the highest rate of the day.
Last night, Bangladesh confirmed the five new deaths caused by COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of day - to - day infections.
Since the day, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, the Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reports that reported cases are 114 and 33 healthy persons sitting at home.
A total of 17 dead persons were recorded.
In the Internet news service, the IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the dead include four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over 60, two between 51 and 60, and one between 41-50.
And he said again that two were come out of Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 fatal March 11.
The hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news source, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an Internet video announcement, the President of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, said that public transportation will be closed for longer than that set up, until this coming Saturday.
This public ban had begun on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of important items -- for treatment, fuel and food -- is still permitted.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on March 8, for two persons who returned from Italy with the wife of one of them.
On March 19, these three are already recovering.
The number of SARS-CoV2 cases exceeds one million worldwide.
On Thursday, the total population of SARS-CoV2 coronavirus passed a million worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths were associated with COVID-19, the disease caused by the Coronavirus.
This happened on the same day that the Malawi confirmed its first outbreak of coronaavirus and Zambia had its first outbreak of colonavirus.
North Korea has said, since Thursday, it is one of the few countries that have no coronary disease.
The previous day, the World Health Organization has submitted a registered report of 1,051,635, including 79,332 cases of illness in 25 hours before 10 a.m. according to the Central European European (19800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of colonavirus have been recorded, associated with about 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reports, quoting Johns Hopkins University data, that more than 1,000 US deaths occurred on Wednesday from the colonavirus flow.
Worldwide, nations have proclaimed tough measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyenin, a city of Moscow, extended the city’s ban until May 1.
Throughout the world, President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians will continue to be paid without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament has voted to expand the national emergency within 15 days; the vote is granted 215 votes, 10 votes, and one with a vote against this.
Saudi Arabia calculates the time to return from the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to continue all day; before, the time to return home was between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to use between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The emperor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the province had enacted its law to stay at home until May 1.
Australian stores have reduced the likelihood of buying a small - room paper at each purchase.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian shopping network Wolkhoworths and Coles has reduced its limit to the sale of toilet paper so that a person can buy two packs and one pack at each store throughout the country, in order.
ALDI again opens the end of one pack on Monday.
These levels have been transmitted as messages on exits and in the Facebook pages of this store.
Buyers would continue to buy large quantities because of the fear of COVID-19 if they had to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Wolkhoworths again caught up the purchase of a toilet paper for those who were put homewards to make one pack for each order.
These changes follow the front end of the 4-pounders for each purchased Wollyworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"Coles, in its March 8, news department, reported that by the end of the four-detectables, "many stores still lose goods after the hour of their import", and call the need "unequal"", while the LDI, in its lower Facebook post on Tuesday, "unforeseen".
"Selling "high" on previous week, according to a Wolkhoorths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also calculates the number allowed to be two acres last week.
In order to cope with the wear, Coles ordered the largest hallways for the surgeons and announced the increase of the sale, Woyeworths an extra suit, while ALDI made stores of a specially designed Wednesday to be available as soon as possible.
Russell Zimmerman, senior director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that merchants try to raise a stock, but the local council's conclusions about the time of truck collisions make things difficult.
He expects production costs to increase, as surgeons try to meet the demand, with a few polishers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of the quick release of the store, some stores could not continue with the Wednesday pants.
In a NewS.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in marketing for Queensland University of Technology, said that shops fill the store every night.
Note that a small - room paper is a weight - weight product, leading to a low number of stores in terms of numbers, and, when completed, it leaves a large space open, strengthening the feeling that it is devoted to worship.
Coles and Wollyworths have a [that] if there were too many items on the shelves, if a product like a small - house paper truck with a [solderable] label may be purchased and there are many, you would probably reduce your fear by ABC News.
The producer of the recently produced Who Gives a Crap has said on Wednesday and has lost the stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who made the Kleenex Tourit Tissue, and Solar Paper who made the Sorbonne, emphasized that they worked 24/7 to keep the output available, according to a NewS.com report.au.
Domaiin.com, a home - sales website, reports that some householders offer free paper to the first person who has ever been upgraded to Melbourne, where few euros are held because the buyers have time off because of the long weekend of the Lauour Day.
The Thursday version of the NT News, a Darwin daily printed newspaper, fitted an appendix with nine pages intended to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
Shoppings were initially reluctant to set limits, according to a ABC Australia report on March 3 when they said they did not have programs to introduce credit limits.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a high need, including masks, potatoes, dried foods, detergents, and flour.
Similarly, except in Australia, on Sunday night the supermarket that sells to the British Internet, Ocado was seen conning the purchase of the Andres private paper so that there were two of the 12-rokers.
The World Health Organization calls COVID-19 plague
Thirdly, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called the continuing outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by Coronavirus SARS-CoV2 — plague.
"While the term "disease" refers to the extent of the disease being affected, not the way specific examples are dangerous, the WHO has shown attention to the need to conduct governments in taking action:"
All countries are still able to change the nature of the plague.
If the nations investigate, survey, treat, separate, follow-up and respond by controlling the lives of the people, says Tedros Adanno Ghebreyesus, the director-O authority of WHO.
We are deeply concerned about both the frightening and the difficult expansion and the alarming lack of movement.
"According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the plague "is not former contrasts."
"He said, according to the observations made to CNN in February, "except the flu, no other respiratory virus has been traced from it to spreading the world."
"Ghebreyesus has expressed the same view, saying "Never before have we seen a plague removed from the beam of the coronavirus."
"He has gone ahead," and "and you've never before seen a disaster which can be controlled at the same time."
The new epidemic situation follows WHO's January decision to call outbreaks a global crisis of public health emergency.
"The director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who said, "the rest, will be worse."
Since Thursday, the Associated Press reports that there have been at least 176,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, leading to more than 4.600 deaths.
The 20th plague of the Coronavirus disease is the ongoing plague of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the secondary respiratory syndrome, 2 (SARS-CoV2).
The outbreak was launched in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as the International Public Health Emergency of Health on 30 January 2020, and it was considered a plague on 11 March 2020.
Since 10 April 2020, 1.61 million accurate examples of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and borders, leading to 97,000 dead.
About 364,000 people are humble.
The number of examples of extinction has been estimated at 4% in China, while the globes range from 13.04% in Algeria to 1.8% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and respiratory inactivity.
Problems may include pneumonia and acute respiratory disorder.
The period of exposure usually lasts five days, but it can last from two to fourteen.
There is no known cure or treatment that can conquer the virus.
The basic approach to treatment that looks for symptoms and practical care. The above - mentioned precautions include hand washing, covering the mouth during a cough, keeping a distance between you and others, and guarding and isolating yourself from people who suspect that they are potentially contagious.
Authorities around the world have already responded by setting limits on transportation, quarantine, motion - control times, safety measures in the workplace, and land restrictions.
The plague has led to a serious global economic and social crisis, a drop or demand for sports, religion, politics, and cultural events, as well as a shortage of needed items that have been eliminated overnight.
Schools as well as school reports are banned worldwide or in 193 countries, affecting 99.4 percent of the majority of students worldwide.
Misconceptions about the virus have spread to the Internet, and there have been circumstances that discriminated against the racism and discrimination of Chinese peoples, other persons from the East and the fertility and the appearance of the North Asian countries, and others from the elderly with many examples of the virus.
As a result of the reduction in travel and blocking of major industries, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (Hubei district capital) reported a network of cases of pneumonia having an unknown origin in 31 December 2019, and the investigation was started in early January 2020.
Many examples have been related to the Huananand Seaped Wholeile Market and so the virus is susceptible to having a genetic origin from the animal.
The virus that caused the outbreak became known as SARS-CoV2, the emerging virus closely related to bats, colonaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first known person who indicated the symptoms was later diagnosed as having developed a disease on December 1, 2019, and that person never had a clear relationship with a full list of wotmarkets.
In the first set of examples reported on December 2019, three parts were found to be connected to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post raised that a follow-up example of 17, November 2019, a 5-year-old person of the Hubei province, may be the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new examples are being reported on in China but growing in Italian, Iran, and South Korea, a number of new examples outside China and is still beyond a number of new Chinese examples for the first time.
There may be reports under examples, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, small cases had been reported among young people, who were 19 and less constitute 2.4% of the world's examples. The chief science consultant of the United Kingdom's sciences, Patrick Vallance, imitating 60% of the British public will need to pass through so that the effactive human population would be accessible.
Examples refer to the number of persons tested by the COVID-19, and their tests proving to be confirmed in accordance with the procedure of law.
Since March 23, no country has studied more than 3% of its population, and many countries had laws to avoid screening those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
The survey published on 16 March found that in China, until 23 January, 86% of the COVID-19 transmission rate was not yet available, and this unprinted link is the source of 79% of the recorded cases.
Statistics analysis published on 30 March estimated that Italian transmission numbers are much higher than reported examples.
The first estimate of the light birthrate (R0) of COVID-19 was from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that there may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
Those who cannot recover, the time from the formation of symptoms to death is between 6 days and 41, most commonly 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, at least 97,000 deaths were established as the cause of COVID-19.
In China, from about 5 February 80% of the deaths were over 60, and 75% are already present with health problems including heart disease and diabetes. Official death rates of the COVID-19 refer mainly to dead persons tested for the COVID as a legal procedure.
The true number of COVID-19 deaths may be very large, since it does not include every person who dies without checking - isib at home, in an adult home, etc.
Part of the data from Italy found that the number of extreme deaths during the epidemic exceeded the official mortality rates due to a COVID in 4-5x.
"A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the death toll] is less than the same as"", a statement corresponding to the "anecdotal reading reports under the U.S.A. such estimates are common when a plague occurs, such as the H1N1 epidemic has a cold in 2009. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.".
The first death that took place outside China itself took place on February 1 of the Philippines, and the first death that took place outside Asia took place in France on February 14.
On February 28, apart from China itself, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and areas had reported death, on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are often used to calculate the mortality rate.
These numbers vary from the place and over the chart, and are influenced by the magnitude of testing, the state of the medical care process, the type of treatment, the time from beginning to outbreak, and the social factors such as age, sex, and general health. Diath-to-cace Ratio shows the number of the dead and divide them into the number of examples considered during a certain period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case Ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) since 10 April 2020.
Statistics vary from place to place.
In China, the measurement of death-to-cace Ratio fell from 17.3% (of those who had symptoms ranging from 1–10 January 2020) to .7% (of those who have symptoms that appeared in 1 February 2020). Other measures include the actuality rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people who have died as a result of disease, and ininfectity radiation (IFR), which shows the percentage of those who have died from infection (IFR).
These figures are not based on time, and they follow the number of individuals from which they come to the conclusion of an illustration.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these figures for a number of people.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence- Based Medicine estimates that the general risk ratio of epidemics is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
A higher estimate of this rate is accompanied by the results of a COVID-19 survey in Germany, and a survey of statistics studying the results of CFR estimates.
WHO asserts that the plague can be controlled.
The exact stage and height of the explosion are uncertain and may vary from place to place.
"Miciej Bonni of Penn State University said, "If left unchecked, concurrent outbreaks become less frequent and begin to decrease with the loss of the disease."
"But it is almost impossible to make a good guessing right now as to when it will be."
" Chinese public health adviser Zhong Nanhan said that "it is probably late by June" if all countries are able to move to follow the WHO's edvn steps to prevent the spread of the virus.
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine spoke of SARS-CoV2 "SAv2" to move around, vigorously for a year or two".
"According to the Imperial College study headed by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other measures will be required "until the solution is found (by washing 18 months or more)."
"U. William Schaffer of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus" will easily disappear forever" may also "a year' and "a year' has become a year's disease, return again."
The return can depend on the solid defense of the flock and the degree of change
COVID-19 symptoms may be misdirected and persons affected may have no symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are heat (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, saliva and saliva from the chest (phlegm), loss of smell, loss of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throats, headaches, colds, vomiting, shemoptysis, diarrhea, or cynosis. WHO has said by no means that 1 in 6 person suffers from severe respiratory problems and respiratory problems.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list that shows symptoms of an emergency such as respiratory difficulty or depression, persistent chest pain or depression, difficulty in getting up, and dark faces or lips; rapid medical attention is encouraged when these symptoms are present. The progress of the disease is likely to lead to severe pneumonia, a risk of pneumonia, a respiratory disease syndrome, sypsis, and death.
Some of those infected may not have symptoms, have no medical symptoms, but their test results confirm the transmission, so researchers have issued advice that those who had close contact with those confirmed should be given close precautions and be tied up to ensure that there is no infection.
China's ratings for those without the signals ratio fix from a few to 44%.
The normal period of warming (the period between passing and exposure) is between one to 14 days; generally is five days. To make an example of uncertainty, measuring half of the people with CIVID-19 who lost their smell at the beginning was 30% and later dropped to 15%.
Some details of how disease spreads are still being discussed.
The disease is believed to be spread mainly during close contact with small droplets that develop when you cough, sneeze, or speak; when the nearest contact is between six and six feet [1 and 2 m].
The study has found that uncovered coughs can lead the falls to a distance of up to 15 feet (4.5 m) to 8.2 milles (27 g).
Some have raised the possibility that the virus may be transmitted by tiny droplets that stay in the air longer, which can be present during speech. Breathing devices may also be built during breathing, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally airborne.
Steels can linger in the lips or noses of people nearby or may be absorbed into the lungs.
Other treatments, such as invasion and cariopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may cause respiratory despiration to swell and result in air loss.
It may also disappear when someone touches the infected area, which includes the skin, and then touches the eyes, the nose, or the mouth.
Or there is concern that they may become more aggressive, the danger they believe is low.
The Chinese government has denied the likelihood of SARS-CoV2 infection by touching the mouth after contacting the feces. The virus has an increased risk of infection within the first three days when symptoms appear even before the onset of symptoms and in the final stages of the disease.
People have been diagnosed with the virus for up to three days before signs of transmission can occur before major symptoms are developed.
Only a few reports of cases do not contain the documented symptoms of the laboratory, but the without signs have been picked up by some countries during subsequent cross - examination.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) points out that although it is not clear how easily disease spreads, one person usually infects two or three others. The virus lives on for hours to days over.
Directly, the virus has been found up to three days in plastics and 304 in pillars, one day on board, until four hours in the colon.
This, however, varies depending on the temperature and temperature of the temperature. Family and other animals have believed that they actually had a COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, even though British drums have ordered man to clean his hands after touching animals, as after contacting areas where infected people may be infected.
Release by respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2) is a new virus, which began to be isolated from three persons with pneumonia and associated with a series of respiratory symptoms in WUhan.
All symptoms of the new SARS-CoV2 virus occur in a way that is related to the nature of the Coronaviruses. Without the human body, the virus dies with the hands of the home, as it dissolves its external defenses. SARS-CoV2 is closely connected with SARS-CoV.
This is because of the origin of the transfer from animal to animal.
Genetic research has revealed that the coronavirus is naturally connected to the Betacoronavirus type, the subtype of the Sabecovirus (lineage B), and the tiny bits of bats.
It is 96% equal to the entire number of samples of other bats. (Bat Cov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is a single amino acid that differs from parts of the chemical structure between the galillins and those of the people.
All the comparison of elements to this day has found that it may be 92% of the original element between the laronvirus and the SARS-CoV2, which is not enough to prove that the millilins are middle-keepers.
The infection may be detected in others by seeing the symptoms, although the sureness eventually occurs by converting transscript polymerase switchaction (rT-PCR) to leaking through a CT or a CT image.
A study comparing PCR with CT in WUhan has raised the appeal that CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although its visibility is lower, since its many group images are in other measures of pneumonia and diseases.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radioology recommends that "CT should not be used for research or that it is the first method of testing the COVID-19".
WHO has published a number of RNA protocols for SARS-CoV2, the first issued on January 17.
Tests are using a re-time retransactation polymerase switchaction (rRT-PR).
Tests can be performed with respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually achieved in periods of a few hours to days.
This test is usually done with a sapwood of the vocal cords even though the throat-washb can also be used. The number of cables and companies improve the natural harvesting process, which is capable of obtaining antibootics.
Since April 6, 2020, not one of these has been advanced as adequate for authority to be used everywhere.
In the U.S. a natural system test developed by Cellex has been approved to be used only in emergency situations with documents.
The characteristics of the icon in the slides and compacted tomography (CT) of the persons displaying the symptoms include a symmetric peripheral sphere or patterns and a set of values.
The Italian Radiological Society combines the netline global database for discovery by verified model images.
As a result of some diseases, such as adenovirus, photographs without PCR confirmation have the limit of pointing to COVID-19.
China's major research has compared the effects of CT and PCR and has shown that the image, although small enough to explain the transmission, is faster and more sensitive, which raises the thought of a test instrument in the ballic areas of the epidemic.
Environmental nethers based on the physical connections are developed so that they can investigate the characteristics of the virus by both radiographs and CT.
Antiviral techniques include maintaining personal hygiene, washing the hands thoroughly, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezes using a brushing paper and putting a clean paper straight into a bottle.
Those who may have received a ride are encouraged to wear a mask in public.
Measures of physical isolation are also encouraged to prevent transmission. Many governments restrict or warn of unnecessary travel to or from the affected countries.
Yet, the virus has reached a high level of infection in many communities in parts of the world.
This means that the virus is still transmitted within communities, and some community members do not know where or how it is transmitted. Health surgeons who care for someone who is likely to be infected are encouraged to use a fixed method of monitoring, contacting, and protection. Following those affected by health authorities is an important way to see the source of continued contact and prevent communication.
Using space space in the pocket for this purpose has removed concern about privacy, Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations are releasing a statement calling for limits on this method of observation.
There are now different mobile vehicles installed or promoted for voluntary use, and since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen professional groups have worked with confidential solutions, such as Bluetoth to install the user's connection log.
Users can now get a message in the event and come close to someone who has been checked confirmed to have a COVID-19. There are quite a confusing idea of how to prevent transmissions; for example, to clean the nose and moushing is not effective.
There is no solution to the COVID-19, though most organizations are working to build it.
Hand washing is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least two seconds, especially when you leave the toilet or the dishes appear unclean; before eating; and after breakfast, coughing, or sneezing.
The reason for this is that apart from the human body, the virus is killed by the home soap, for it explodes its protective rifle.
The CDC also encouraged the use of alcohol-based hand-based nitizers and at least 60% of alcohol Volume if soap and water are not available at that time.
WHO urges people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Areas can be cleared of pollution with a few solutions (in one minute of exposure to the testicles testee), including 62–771% of ethanol, 50–100% of theospropanol, 0.1% of sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% of hydrogen perxide, and 0.5% of phovidone-odine.
Other solutions, such as eselconium chloride and chrohexidine glue, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if the example of the COVID is suspected or confirmed in such places as office or day care, all areas such as offices, toilets, public facilities, public equipment such as tabloids, contact screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by patients should be killed by the virus.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a elbow or a throat when coughing, or sneezing, and quickly discard any chimney.
Surgeons are greeted by those who may be highly contagious, since wearing masks puts the limit in size and the range of breathing droplets goes out in speaking, sneezes, and coughs.
The WHO has issued guidelines about time and how to use masks.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a logologist at the University of Leeds, "Dailying the mask may reduce [people's] tendency to touch their faces, which is the main source of access without proper hand hygiene. "Buckskis are also encouraged to be used by those who care for someone who is likely to have a disease."
WHO has encouraged that nonpatients can wear masks only if they are in high danger, such as those who care for a OVID-19 person, although they also agree that wearing masks can help people avoid face - to - face contact.
Many countries have begun to promote the use of masks by members of society.
In the U.S., the CDC encourages wearing cloth masks rather than using health services. China has specifically recommended that non-patient members use discarded health masks, especially when they are too close to one another at three feet [3 m] or below) with other people.
Hong Kong encourages to wear a surgical mask when taking public transportation or living in full areas.
Health workers in Thailand encourage people to make plastics in their homes and clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia officially closed the doors to the public without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
In March 16, the Vietnamese asked everyone to wear masks when traveling to public places to protect himself and others.
The Austrian government insisted that everyone entering a restaurant should wear a mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear a government mask when in the community.
Taiwan, as it has been producing ten million masks a day since the middle of March, asking city railway and bus passengers to wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made it compulsory to wear a mask whenever you go out, while at the same time it encourages you to build a mask at home for those who can't afford the facial masks.
Facial masks have been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Sitting apart (also known as physical isolation) includes steps to control relationships intended to minimize the spread of disease by reducing contact between people.
Roads include separating; travel restrictions; school closeds, places of employment, stadiums, parks, and shopping centers.
Individuals may be able to use isolation by staying at home, getting pregnant, avoiding crowded places, greeting without contacting one another, and physically isolating others.
Many governments are now pressuring or encouraging social dialysis in those areas affected by the plague.
A high gathering number raised by the U.S. government and health agencies were quickly reduced to 250 persons (if there was no increase of the COVID-19 in the area), placed 50 people, and later reached 10.
On 22, March 2020, Germany officially closed a social gathering of more than two persons. The elderly and those with existing health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory, and multiple immune systems face the risk of severe illness and problems and the CDC warned them to stay at home as far as possible in areas of the plague. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health branches began to use the term 's physical isolation' instead of that term 's isolation', so that it is clear that it is intended to reduce physical contact at the same time of contact and physical contact is kept in contact.
"Use of the term "secular isolation" and leads to the conclusion that people must be fully involved in social isolation, which may encourage them to continue to communicate with others in different ways. Some authorities issue guidelines for sexual health that can be applied while the plague continues.”
These include the urge to have sex alone with a roommate, who is free of the virus or the symptoms of the virus.
Separating home stay is what has been encouraged for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect that they are likely to be infected.
Health - care providers have issued detailed instructions for separating themselves properly from home, and many governments have either enforced or encouraged the isolation of everyone living in the affected areas.
The heavy - run house safety regulations have been passed on by those in high - risk groups.
Those who may be exposed to someone with a COVID-19 and those who have recently visited the country or the most widely transmitted area were encouraged to shut them up for 14 days from the time of the last exposure.
Tactics for control of the plague to close or pressure, and to reduce.
The ban is followed in the early stages of the plague and intent on searching and isolating those involved and that other control programs were introduced to control transmissions and remedies to prevent the spread of disease to other people.
If there is no possibility to prevent the spread of disease, efforts are being made to reduce the risk: steps are taken to minimize the spread and reduce the effects of health - care and social work.
Stimulating both locking steps and lowering may be followed at the same time.
Pressure requires very hard measures to reverse the epidemic by reducing the light birthrate to less than 1. The part of the control of the outbreak of infectious disease to try to reduce the height of the plague, known as crossing the line of the plague.
This reduces the risk that health services are found to be frustrated and gives more time for medicine and medicine to be developed.
Simple interventions that can control the eruption include physical precautions, such as physical hygiene, wearing masks, closing, community measures that are intended to isolate schools as well as to give rise to public events; participation in encouraging the public to take part in such such; and so natural measures as to clean up the environment. The more stringent measures to prevent eruptions were taken in China when the size of the eruption became clear, such as closing off the cities, and setting down the laws to protect the visit.
Other countries have also taken different measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has created public viewing and has made neighborhood arrests, and it issued warnings about the movements of those affected.
Singapore has suffered financial support from those who have come under arrest and has forced a high price on those who have failed to do so regularly.
Taiwan has raised an image production of weeks and has imposed a penalty for machin treatment. The situation of Great Britain and the United States indicates that reducing (fundamental but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and stress (to reverse the growth of the epidemic) is extremely difficult.
Major reduction laws may reduce the serious need for health care by 2.3 per cent, yet the conclusion is to the death of hundreds of thousands and confusion of health programs.
Pressure may be better but requires preservation as long as the virus continues to surround human society (or until the solution is found, if the solution comes first), since the exchange jumps quickly when the steps are relaxed.
Long - term intervention in the wake of a plague creates a cost both for society and for the economy.
There are no direct medications to fight COVID-19, but efforts to build them are on the way, including testing available drugs.
Taking drugs from stores, drinking liquids, and rest may help ease symptoms.
Dependence on weight, breathing therapy, constipation, and breathing support may be necessary.
Using steroids may spell consequences.
Most of the elements authorized to work on other growing diseases are tested for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also issued that "some old and domestic remedies" could be operated on these symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Promoting energy and adapting health care according to the need of the COVID-19 patients is raised by WHO as a crucial step toward reaction.
The ECDC and the European regulatory of WHO have released key hospital and health care providers by dismantling services in different categories, including centering the functions of the laboratory in the assessment of the COVID-19, demanding options where possible, selecting and separating the approved COVID-19 patients, and raising the critical control capacity of the staff and increasing the number of breathing aids and beds.
Opinions vary as to where the first example (called the egg patient) came from.
The first famous example of the new corona is returning to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In a month or so, the figure of the Coronavirus examples in Hubei was slightly higher.

Australia, the plague created a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The development of this has resulted in a shortage of bottle feed for children in some major stores by the Australian government and then closed. Despite the high quality of the disease Covid-19 in Northern Italy and in the Wuhan region and the great need for subsequent food supplies, both areas had no major food shortage.
The steps of China and Italy against the acquisition and trafficking of the most important goods will be successful and preventing the expected food shortages in Europe and North America
Northern Italy and its abundance of crops saw no great decline, but according to those representing the industry, the numbers may rise.
The absence of food from the restaurants was temporary even in the town of Wuhan, and in China, government officials have given up live pigs ’ meats to protect the population’s food supply.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require those who undergo surgery for food to have an emergency period.

A test of reppiratory coronavirus disease 2019 Corvid-19 and SARS-Cov2 virus associated with it includes methods of detecting the presence of viruses and those that see positive antibodies as a result.
The presence of viruses in templates is confirmed by RT-PCR that detects the presence of the coronavirus RNA.
This study was specially designed to examine the SARS-Cov2 virus.
It is used to ensure new or existing diagnosis.
The provision of antibodies, deserology, can be used both for screening a person's disease or for pension.
A study of antibodys shows how many people have developed a disease and those whose symptoms were too small to be reported or without any symptoms.
The exact number of deaths from this disease and the extent of the general incendiary population can be determined by the outcome of the test.
Because of the estimates, by March 2020, there were no countries whose statistics were not reliable as to the number of viruses spread to their population.
In March 23, no country has studied more than 3 % of the people in its countries and there is a significant difference in the number of surveys done in various countries.
These differences may have a profound effect on reported deaths that may have exceeded the borders of certain countries.
With the use of re-time repositories transfer, rt-PCR, this test can be made on repiratory recovery in various ways, including non-superative tab or sputum recovery.
Results are usually within two to two hours.
RT-PCR tests with throats can only have confidence in the first week for cases of disease.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but continues to grow in the lungs.
In people who have a second week's examination, some partial metamorphosis can be removed from the depth of the smell catheter or by coughing the metabolic, sputum, can be used.
Some of the first PCR tests were developed in Berlin in January 2020 with the use of the re-time transisteration transfer function, the source of the circulation of the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom had also developed a method of testing on 23 January 2020. The South Korean Company Kogenebiotech developed PCR-based SARSCV2 kit to the level of clinical research on 28 January 2020.
"The "Egene" is the same for all the beta coronaviruses and RdRp gene available only to SARS-CoV2. In China, the BGI Group was one of the companies that received approval of the National Products Administration Administration of China to use the PCR-base SARS-CV2. In the United States, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centres of the WesternC, published 20-Nvirusive Development, 2019, by the National Development of the Development of the National Development on-NI-T Development of the Development.
Three of the genetic test methods of early test methods resulted in some vague results because of the results of the problem of the problem with the CDC and the complexity of tests in Atlanta, which resulted in a level of less than 100 samples per day that they succeeded in February 2020.
The two sections were not found to be reliable until February 28, 2020 and until then state and local survey stations were allowed to begin the survey.
This method of testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Administration. The independent laboratory began a survey early March 2020.
5, March 2020, LabCop proclaimed international discovery of the COVID-19 survey based on RT-PCR.
The Quest Dialogues similarly made a COVID-19 survey discovered from 9 March 2020.
No amount of calculation announced, collection and processing of specims should be done according to the CDC requirements.
In Russia, a survey of the COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR
In 11 February 2020 this test was registered by the Federal Service for Survey in Health. In 12 March 2020, May Clinic was reported to have developed a type of testing on COVID-19. On 13, March 2020, Roche Diagnoss received a FD code of research within 3.5 hours and thus allowed one device to do a 4128 test in 24 hours.
In March 2020, the FDA released the Abbot Laboratories permission of critical times, the EUA, to investigate the Abbott m2,000 policy, the FDA had already given the Hollogic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific authorization.
On March 21-2020, Cephed likewise received a EU by a FDA test type that lasts less than 45 minutes.
The FDA has allowed a test type that uses the sothermel nucleic acid an against technology instead of PCR.
Because this does not require a series of cold and heat cycles, this type can provide results in postitive in five minutes and four minutes.
Currently there are some 18,000 devices in the U.S. and Abbott is expected to increase its sensitivity to 50,000 tests per day. The tests that use the monoclonetic antibody that adhere to nucleopsid protein, Nprotein, nonvel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan in hopes that it may be able to produce results in 15 to 20 minutes like influenza.
"A revision of the March 2020 text concluded that "" chest radiographs do not help much in the first paragraphs and that the CT, computer tomography, may occur before the symptoms of the disease develop.
Common CT features include the bilateral multime-flags epacies with peripheral, ammetricand posterior navigation.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving and conconsoledation increase as the disease changes it.
A survey comparing PCR with CT at Wuhan at the site where the plague started suggests that CT is more sensitive than PCR but has no details, most of it corresponds to other pneumonia and disease procedures.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radioology encourages "CT to be used for sorting or testing COVID-19" according to March 2020, the CDC encourages the PCR for the first death."
Half the immune respose to disease is the production of antibodies including Igm and IgG.
These can be used to test the presence of the disease since the last 7 days or more began the symptoms of disease, in order to indicate public incompetentness and employment. Assays can be made up of major check centers, CLTs, or point-of-caring, PUCT.
A high degree of automated Systems in many medical research facilities will be able to work with Esys, but their availability will depend on the speed of each one.
With CLT, only one perpecimen of peripheral blood is used normally, although separatians can be used for immune reactions.
With POCT, one blood specim is usually discovered by pulling the skin.
In contrast to PCR methods, the jump action is not necessary before the essay. On 26 March 2020, the FDA introduced the 29 engraved words that reported this Agency as necessary and is now able to distribute their antibody test.
On April 7, 2020, only one method of testing permitted by the FDA under the supervision of emergency conditions. By the end of March 2020, the Euroimium Medical Laboratory Dignotics and Erootme Dignotics found the permission of their European testic testics to identify the IgG and IgA antivirus against the baslods.
The range of tests is a few hundred times during an hour, so it is much faster than the plantation PCR assay of the Viral RNA.
The presence of antibiotics is usually tested after 14 days of infection. In April, the UK discovered that none of the antibody testits could be used effectively.
"HS" in which suspects of patients may stay at home, "" "" for the purpose of emergency conditions to give the patient a spleen tube", to breathe in, get back and get results after a short period of time. The British NHS has announced that it starts a home - check program to eliminate the threat that the patient will take to others for treatment or the need to clean up the person's vehicle if it is used. As for those who are warned of an illness in cases of CoVID-19, the health worker who takes the appropriate use of the device.
The drivering stations helped South Korea perform a very fast, overly intense survey on any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statary Health Insurance Physicians spoke of 2 March, saying that it contained some 12,000 tests per day on the blackboard and 10.700 studies were conducted the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance when a medical examination is called by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to include 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19 a study of the passing of the motor vehicle was given in many large cities.
Since March 26, 2020, a German survey rating was unknown, since only true results are reported.
"The first survey of the web showed that from the week of the calendar 12/20/20, the total of at least 483,995 samples tested until it included 12/2020 checks and 33.491 samples of SARS-CoV2. Israel, researchers at the Technion and Ramham Hospitals and tested the way to test records of at least 484 cases once, by including only a sample screening one when the composite device showed that the WD is a guarantee of the 2,0-Modogue (6.9%) was approved of SARKUB, or "UMP" for "UMP" February".
Since the building is still run by the BGI founder Wang Jian and took 5 days, the model model shows that the Hubei examples would be high by 47% and the necessary cost of meeting imprisonment would be doubled if the capacity to compile a test did not be found in time.
The Wuhan Leb is quickly followed by the Huo-Yan cables in Shezen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities throughout China.
From March 4 2020 the total transfer of the day is an experiment of 50,000 tests per day. The open, intricate designs released by Origami Assays have been opened to enable them to examine most patients' sample samples up to 1972 for 1CoVID19 using only 93 assys. These techniques with technology can work in small labels without the need of hydrologics.
Since March, shortages and insufficient numbers of sharks have become at least as many as between the EU and the UK and the US.
This led to some writers ’ studying the policies for the samples that involve burning samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release more of the RNA elements being examined. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now studying the number of its increased population looking at Coronavirus head than any other country, and were walking well on the test level to reach a greater population.
"This was a combination of combinations of the power of passing the motor, and the purchase of pop-scale ms-throughupt laboratory in Group 42 and BGI (based on "Huo-Yan" emergency division in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of directing tens of thousands of tests on the RT-PCR daily and the first in the world of this active level outside China.
Various research techniques for research on various parts of the coronary elements are built in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization chose the German process of building chain pumps that were sent to poor countries with no resources to build their own.
The German policy was published on 17 January 2020; a policy developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control did not occur until 28 January, delayed studies available in the U.S.. China and the United States faced the problems of confidence in laboratory tests at the beginning of outbreak, and these countries and Australia could not build and issue up adequate teams to meet the need and encouragement of health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that the extensive discovery of research in South Korea has reduced the spread of the new corona.
The capacity to include testing, especially on independent cables, is built over a period of years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the use of research methods as the best way to stimulate the outbreak of the COVID-19 plague. The increased demand for screening for the extent of the spread of the virus caused a buildup of hundreds of thousands of workers in the U.S. web sites to be isolated, and the removal of basbs and chemical reages was stressfuled.
In March 2020 China reported problems with the accuracy of its check tanks.
"In the United States, CDC scans were found "" with "mistaken"" by the government removed law walls that had prevented private investigations. Spain bought companies from the Chinese organization Sonzen Bioney Biotechnology Cotd, but found the results were not correct.
The company explained that the wrong results may be due to judging the collection of samples or the proper use of cookies.
The Spanish Ministry said that it would produce mistaken results, and it will put in its own room separate weeks of checkpoints prepared for by the Songeen Bioneyy. 80% of the Czech Republic checkpoints bought in China produce faulty results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million checks from China that were found to be wrong.
"Prime Minister Matovič recommended that it be discarded in the Danube. The Ateş Kara of Turkish Health Ministry said that the Turkish check cookies in China were found with "the high degree of error" and didn't """" was used. "The UK bought 3.5 million checks in China but at the beginning of April 2020 reported that they were not used.
Tests, followed by the arrest of those who were found to be sure on tests and followed by those who had made contact with persons who indicated that the SARS-CoV2 tests were checked, and the results were confirmed as well.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vą, the first place of the COVID-19 in Italy, headed a total of 3,400 people, at least ten days away.
At least half the people who went to the survey had no symptoms, and all the examples that were found were locked up.
Since visits are completed, this takes away a completely new connection.
In keeping with the eager anticipation of the victims, incoming visits are caught, testing, and blocking, the 2020 Coronavirus plague in Singapore has continued to be sweeter than other developed countries, but without such heavy limits as forcing closed restaurants and other commercial markets.
Many cases have been proposed, and Singapore began to advise citizens to stay at home on March 28, but schools opened in time after holiday on March 23.
Several countries have also been able to care for the devastation with the effort to follow up those involved, to close the internal journey, to finish the inspection, and to be shut down, but to a small degree, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistics have found that nations are studying more and more, in contrast with the number of deaths, have lower rates of death, which may be due to reason that they are in a better position to investigate those with signs of poverty or none at all.
WHO recommends that the nations that have no capacity to compile tests and that have national laboratorys with limited experience with the COMPID-19 will send the first five and ten reliable samples of the COVID-19 to one of the 16 trusted WHO Web pages to ensure a test.
Among the 16 reliable, 7 Asian, 5 European, 2 African, 1 North American and 1 Australian.
In the next chart, column "Certification" is affected by the global survey method.
The world that checks only the admitted patients will have many assurances of % of a test that checks all its citizens, no matter whether they show signs or not, some things are the same.
Hand washing (or washing your hands), also known as hand washing, hand washing with the purpose of removing the soil, ice, small objects, or unwanted sponges.
Cleaning your hands with soap without mention in those "critical times" during the day protects the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are interconnected with the nervous system.
People can also be exposed to respiratory diseases such as colds or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is to say, the characteristics that are unpleasant to us).
The five critical periods during the day when washing your hands with soap are important include: before and after removing them, after cleaning the eggs or changing the diapers, before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or domestic birds.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization encourages hand washing:
Before, inside, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning the child using the toilet.
After a cough, a cough, or a sneeze.
After touching an animal, an animal’s diet, or an animal’s pollution.
Sanitary hygiene refers to cleaning methods that are related to the medical process.
Washing your hands before offering medication or medical help can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to purify the hands by cleaning the parathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is important to those handling food or working in the medical field, but it is an important procedure even for the common community.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of colds, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the communicable causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and to reduce the infant mortality rate in the home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing may lead to a small improvement during the development of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the death toll associated with respiratory and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple lifestyle changes, such as detergent cleansing.
Simple action can reduce the mortality rate with these diseases by about 50%.
Intriguing methods that encourage the washing of hands with soap can reduce the portions of diarrhea by three parts, and this can be compared to the cutting of clean water in poorer areas.
The reduction of diarrhea pieces by 48% can be linked to the washing of hands with soap. Soiling with soap is one effective and inexpensive method for protecting diarrhea and scisspiratory inputs (ARI), as a natural behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
pneumonia, the largest ARI, leads alone as a cause of infant deaths under five years of age, destroys an estimated 1.8 million childhood health benefits a year.
Both diarrhea and pneumonia contribute to the death of about 3.5 million babies a year.
According to UNICEF, switching hands washing before meals and after using the toilet that it has become a fixed habit can save more health than any single solution or medical intervention, it decides to die for at least half the reason of diarrhea and death by respiratory diseases.
Hand washing is usually combined with other interventions for transporting waste as part of the water, sewage and sanitation (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against emphysema by direct contact.
A minor accident as a result of regular washing of the hands is damage to the skin from dry skin.
The Danish study of 2012 found that hand washing too much could have the effect of bite, and the shape of a covered leather known as hand eczema or ddermatitis, which is the most common in people who are not in health care.
Cleaning hands is also seen as one of the most common signs of OCD disease.
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of the disease through oral control: after using the toilet (washing, self - defecating), after cleaning the baby's genitals (constitutions), before feeding, before eating or after handling raw meat, fish, or domestic birds.
Sometimes a proper hand - washing procedure should be followed to avoid passing the disease before and after handling the injury or injury; after coughing, coughing, or coughing; after touching an animal’s nose or handling animals; and after handling waste.
In many countries, there is a low rate of soap - washing.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 1915 found that, on the average, 38.7% of families follow a soap-washing process. The 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had a high rate of 97 percent; the United States near the middle of 77 percent; and China at a low rate of 23 percent. The few habits are now in promoting the practice of washing hands at critical times. Cleaning as a group of children at school times in the developing countries has increased their hands in order to keep their hands dry.
The "E Essential Health Care Program" instituted by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the practice of encouraging the health and education statistics.
Removals are twice a year, accompanied by soap and hand washing, daily washing with fluoride, a key element of the world order.
It was also successfully begun in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganism from the skin is better done with the installation of soap or the cleansing of water.
The main function of soap and cleaning is to reduce the decomposing of the solution, and to increase soluty.
Water alone does not wash the skin away because oil and protein, which are built into the soil, do not easily dissolve in the water.
But cleaning helps the flow of water to the extent possible.
A pot of soap, since it is capable of reuseing itself, may keep the bacteria remaining in front of you.
The small number of studies that watch the transmission of a virus from a contaminated pot of air conclude that it is impossible to correct bacteria and foam.
The CDC continues to say that ‘ liquid soap and control without hands is better.
Gifts that eliminate germs are highly advertised by health - conscious members of the community.
To this day, there is no evidence that the use of proposed anti-retics or disinfectants prefers natural antibiotic-resistants.
However, antibacterial soaps have ordinary agents such as atrosan, which has a long list of organist movements.
Thus, even if non-disistant starins are an antibacterial soap, they may not be able to function properly as best as they are sold.
Besides that the surfacant and the protection agent, complex structures may contain acids (accetic acid, anacoric acid, anaccic acid) as ruler of the pH, an antivirally active benic acids and other skin caregivers (aloe vera, proteins, limbs, plastics, plaques). An extensive examination from the U.S.
Hot water with which you can wash your hands doesn’t burn to the right extent to cause bacteria to die.
Viruses grow more when the temperature of the pond is (37 °C).
Yet, warm, soapy water works better than cold water, containing soap in the form of natural oils that trap soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that using warm water does not contribute to reducing microbial lead.
Hand sanitizer or Hand antiptic is a representative of non-water detergent detergent cleaning.
At the end of the 1990s and early part of the 21st century, non-salcoid detergents from rubbing alcohol (also known as alcool-based rubs, antistemp cand rubs, or handizers) began to gain popularity.
Many of these are based on the propyl alcohol or ethanol that has been added together by a heated representative like Carbon (polymer of acrylic acid), or amucant such as glycerin, or foam so that it is easier to use and lower the calcium condition.
Immune hydrogen-peroxide increases the effectiveness of an antibacterial activity. Handnitizers have 60 to 95% alcohol, effectively killing bacteria.
Alcohol rub sanizers kill bacteria, multi-ductive bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tubicullis, and other microbes (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rTSV, rinovirus, vicinia, enfluenza, and hepatitis).
Alcohol rub rubers with 70% of alcohol kill 99.97% (-3.5 log on less, similar to 35 decibel) bacteria in the hands in 30 seconds after they are anointed with 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 kg) in the hands of bacteria by drop) a 1 minute after loading. The hand tanizers function in some bacteria.
Hand sanitizers are virtually inactive in nonrovirus (or Norilk) type of bacteria, the main cause of intercommunteritis. The sufficient anti-simpic or alcohol rub must be used to soften completely or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the fluid, foam or cell is dried.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing the hands rather than rubbing with sand furniture, a lady when it is clear that the hands are clean.
The rise in the use of these symbols is due to their simple action and quick ability to kill micro-organisms; however, they should be used to replace appropriate hands washing except where soap and water are not available.
The regular use of alcohol-based handnzizers can cause a dry skin unless it is applied to organics and/or skin sanitizers in combination.
The alcohol - dry process can be reduced or eliminated by installing glycerins and/or modules in combination.
In medical studies, a hand sanitizers based on alcohol with almonds produce a skin that is much easier and dry than soaps or amphibials.
Allergic contact listmatitis, contact untcaria syndrome or hyperactivity to alcohol or adives that are present in alcoholhand rubs are rare.
The low position of causing the critant contact to be attractive when compared to washing your hands with soap and water.
Regardless of their effectiveness, unregulated vehicles do not wash their hands from nature, but they do kill only bacteria.
This is because the sand sands do not work properly as soap and water to prevent the spread of more and more parathogens, as the pothogens continue to be in the hands.
Success of non-alcohol can be attributed more to ingredients and combinations, and they are historically more embarrassing than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, the combination of esalconium chloride has shown the persistence and increase in the operation of an antimispheric function after anointing, in contrast with alcohol, which has been shown to reduce the working rate after repeated working, may be due to further skin reactions.
Many people in economically poor communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or soil in place.
Steam or soil may work better than water, but it works less than soap.
One concern is that when soil or ash receives micro-organism pollution, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also an antibacterial agent because when mixed with water, a mixture of alkaline is formed.
The WHO encourages ash or sand instead of soap if the soap is not available.
A proper hand - washing procedure recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for Prevention of Transmission of Disease includes these steps:
Rinse in warm or cold running water.
Flowing water is encouraged because standing snails may be contaminated, whereas cold or hot water does not show the difference.
Wash your hands with proper soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap raises germs in the skin, and studies indicate that people usually clean their hands better when soap is available than when they use water.
Disconnect for at least 20 seconds.
Sneaking results in heat, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and prolonged diarrhea removes more germs.
Clean well under running water.
Cleaning in a wash can defile the hands
To dry with a clean towel or allow them to dry with air.
Wet and thorny hands take away waste: areas easily forgotten by the thumb, event, space between the fingers, and under nails.
Veil fittings and eaten Polish can hold microorganism.
A wet watch is often encouraged to keep the hands dry; a dry skin can lead to skin damage that can raise the exposure of the disease.
A variety of inexpensive programs can be made to meet up with hand washing when water is piped and/or soap is not available. To fill the water by hanging up the vessel or drum with appropriate holes and/or using ash if required in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water (such as schools or rural areas in the developing world), there are procedures for saving water, such as "tappy-taps" and other types of saving money.
Tappy-lap is a simple technique for using a rope-laid drum, and a foot pad that pumps little water into the hands and a bar of soap.
The working dryness of the hands is an important part of the system of hand hygiene, but there is a disagreement about how to make a better fire in public cleaners.
An increasing level of research suggests that the paper towels are better cleaner than the gas extinguishers found in the laundry.
In 2008, research directed by the University of Westminster, London, which was also sponsored by the European Tissue Sympium, to compare the standards of hygiene found in paper towels, voyenogens, and fresh - air fertilizers.
After washing and drying of the hands with hot gas, the total number of bacteria was found to rise on the fingers at a rate by 1941 and on the finger net by 254%.
Steel dryness was achieved by an average of the total number of bacteria in the hands of 42% and in hand net 15%.
After cleaning and drying the hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria dropped by the average to 76% of the fingers and on the fingers of the hands by reaching 77%. Scientists also took a second look at the possibility that there was a chance of contact with the cleaner operators and cleaning as a result of each method of drying.
The fast-smoker, which pumped the air from it at the 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), succeeded in reducing micro-organisms in the hand and in almost joining other users and cleaning up to a distance of about 8 feet [2 m].
The use of hot air can spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 meters away from ours.
Paper towels did not indicate a significant spread of micro-organisms. In 2005, research directed by TąV Prodult und Ullt, different methods of drying were examined.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after the drying of hands were observed:
There are many manual manufacturers available, and handmills have been compared to dried by the towels.
Cleaning hands with sanitics is another way to take a trip in soap and water.
Alcohol-built lover must have alcohol by at least 60%.
Medical hand washing was forced long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis obtained its work (1846) to protect the disease in the hospital area.
There are electrical relievers that operate with a note reminding hospital workers to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a reduction in the rate of disease by its operation.
Hand washing takes 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or glue to anoint or rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed together with fingers held together.
If there is contamination under nails, a bronze shell can be used to remove it.
Since germs can stay in the water in the hands, it is important to clean up and clean the soil with clean towels.
After drying, a sheet of paper should be used to fill the water (and open any exit if possible).
This is to avoid again polluting your hands in those places.
The idea of washing your hands in a state of care is to remove the parathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid passing them on.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that cessation of hand washing continues at unacceptable levels in many medical facilities, a large number of doctors and nurses continue to forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus transfer microorganisms.
One study showed that hand washing by way and other simple procedures can reduce the level of catheter-radted bloodstaam inputs by6 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing the program of hand washing and rubbing hands in the field of health care.
Organizational procedures that are maintained by hand - cleaning can be obtained from its compass so that the public can observe it.
The proper compensation was directed by Whitby et al.
Shopmarkets can balance and ensure proper hand hygiene, provided they are required to show and conform to the law.
The World Health Organization "has five times" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood/ plasma
period during the period of the
and after the care of the patient. Applying antigens ("in medicine" or gifts "to prevent microbes") gives you the power to kill in that washing of hands.
That power of death may be required before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organ elements are plentiful. 'Class' for the purpose of operating, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without hand contact, chloxidine or iodine wassh, testels to dry after washing, and the test blue light for cleaning and other testery elements for cleaning under nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of the hands and arms to the elbow, usually for 2-6 minutes.
Long periods of sniffing (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When you are hung, the water in your arms must be stopped and not run back into your hands.
After the final washing of the hands, hands are dried with sterile cloth or the surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is best to wash your hands or use a handcuff before and after taking care of a sick person.
In order to control scaphyloccal disorders in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from clean hands comes from 20% of the first cleaning, and that there is very little more benefit available when repeated hand washing is raised than 35%.
Cleaning with empty soap results in a third-rate of an bacterial infection compared with cleaning with a non-ubbination. Contrasting the sand-rubing with alcohol-based sool solution with the antibacterial field for a quarter of 30 weeks followed by the alcohol consumption by the alcohol-dubing factor.
But soap and water work better than alcohol-based rubbs in reducing H1N1 influenza A virium difficles in hand. Intervention to improve hand care conditions may include teaching workers by washing their hands, promoting the availability of alcohol-based varnd bullb, and written and memorials to workers.
There is a need for further research that checks which of these methods of intervention work best under different health - care conditions.
In developing countries, soap - washing is recognized as a means of preservation, an important instrument for achieving good health, even a physical nourishment.
Yet, lack of reliable water feed, soap, or hand washing facilities in people’s homes, schools, and workplaces presents a challenge to the practice of washing the hands of the world.
In many African villages, for example, handwashing taps and private toilets are missing, even though there are inexpensive methods to build hand - cleaning facilities.
However, low hand - washing levels may be the reason for habits that are stronger than those of soap or water shortages.
Advertising and a demonstration of soap - washing can contribute to making legal decisions, promoting awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and leading to a change of traditional practices.
For this to work properly, caution and concentration are essential.
A review of 70 studies has found that social programs are useful in promoting hand washing in the LMICs, while social advertising campaigns are less effective. One example of advertising in college "The Three Stars" of UNICEF encourages schools to take simple, protective steps to ensure that students are cleaning their hands with soap, during other requirements of hygiene.
When small amounts are reached, schools can move from one to another and eventually into three stars.
Creating hand washing can be part of a hand - cleaning campaign that is done to reduce the disease and death of infants.
Earth's Day for Cleaning the Hands is one of the examples of safety efforts in trying to achieve a change in habits. As a result of the 20th-20 epidemic of colonavirus, UNICEF declared the widespread use of the automation engine.
A few studies have considered the cost of hand - washing work in developing countries and cooperation and the prevention of DALYs.
One review, however, raises the point that a soap - washing advertisement saves more expense than other water interventions and cleaning.
The importance of washing one’s hands in a person’s health - especially underfowl conditions such as mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first observed in the mid - 19th century by two hand cleaners: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English "The founder of modern beauty".
At that time many people still believed that disease was caused by bad odors called maasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks from diet and medical - related illnesses led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand washing as an important way to prevent the spread of disease.
The outbreak of candy flu in 2009 and the plague of COVID-19 in20 led to a high - security awareness in many countries regarding the importance of detergent washing with soap to protect one from this type of infectious disease.
For example, posters with the inscription "the proper method of hand washing" are hung up near the washrooms and private rooms in the offices and airports in Germany.
The saying "Clean your hands" means clearing someone who does not want to take responsibility for something or to be involved in it.
Its origin is part of the Bible in Matthew when Pontius Pilate cleanses his hands in making the decision to impale Jesus Christ, but it has become a universal expression in other English communities.
In the Maccabees of Shakespeare, Macbeth's lady begins to force her hands to purify herself by trying to cleanse herself of supposed uncleanness, which represents a guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and persuaded her husband to do.
It was also found that people, after having recalled or contemplating the wrong actions, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and they tend to appreciate the value of more hand washing.
Moreover, when they are not allowed to wash their hands afterward, their chances of sharing in “clean ” acts, such as volunteerism, are limited.
Religion encourages the washing of hands with both the purpose of cleanness and symbolism. A symbol in the use of water, but without soap to purify the hands, is part of a system of hand washing that exists in many religions, including Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and nenetic dye for Judaism, Lavabo to Christianity, and Lauhu to Islam. Religions also encourage hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam force hand washing behind the use of the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam force the washing of hands before and after meals.
COVID-19 work environment management
Risk management in the area of the COVID-19 work is the application of Occupational risk factors and Halth in preventing Coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The appropriate management of an accident in the workplace depends on the work environment and the type of activity, based on testing the risk of exposure, the difficulty of the disease in the community, and the hazards to individual workers who may be weak in preventing the COVID-19.
According to the U.S.O. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSA), low - risk activities with social contact with other employees, which means that simple precautions are encouraged, include cleaning the hands, encouraging workers to stay at home when they are sick, breathing habits, and keeping the routine of cleaning and killing bacteria in the workplace.
Substantial activities include those that require regular and close contact with people unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but they may be infected because of ongoing social or international travel.
This includes employees who can contact the common population as schools, work - intensive businesses, and multimillion - market transactions.
The risk management controls in this group, in addition to simple preventive measures, include High-efificiency arfers, sneeze vectors, and a personal protocol available in cases where a OVID-19 person is found.
The Osha considers health workers who are exposed to the public or who are accused of having COVID-19 as a higher risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure when workers make up aerosol-generating procedors, or carry out or treating specimens from people who are known or accused of having COVID-19.
The safety controls that are appropriate for these applications include building controls such as the internal pressure processoms, and the personal protocols suitable for the project.
The flow of*COVID-19 can have serious consequences within the working area.
Workers may be away from work because of sickness, the need to care for others, or fear of being exposed.
Marketing habits may change, both of which are needed, with ways of getting these goods (such as buying on time when you are not busy or by getting a ride or by driving jobs).
Finally, the transfer of items from hard-controlled COVID-19 may be disturbed. The preparation for a communicable disease and response systems can be used to direct protective actions.
Programs consider the risks involved in different places of work and type of work, including exposure, hazards from home or social conditions, and the hazards of individuals as well as from higher years or conditions of chronic illness.
They also clarify proper control so as to cope with the risks, and the following programs of situations can develop as a result of eruptions.
The readiness for infectious disease and reactor programs may depend on the promotion of national or regional law.
The goals of responding to the explosive situation include reducing leisure activities between employees, protecting people at high risk of serious health problems, keeping a business, and reducing the adverse effects of other businesses and shopholders.
The weight of the disease in the community the business is affected by the reactions taken.
Risk-control ladders are a general use for the Occupational safety and health control by the effects.
When the risk of COVID-19 is not removed, effective management of building control is followed by management discipline, and ultimately personal protection.
Construction management involves separating workers from work - related dangers without relying on the worker’s routine, and it can be a step toward placing too much expense.
Offices for changes in business policy or procedures that require the action of an employee or an employer
Personal Protection Equiption (PPPE) is less effective than control of the building and control of the administration, but it can help to avoid exposure.
All PPE types must be chosen on the basis of an employee's risk, dressed appropriately as appropriate (e.g., ambulances), worn regularly, checked regularly, maintained, and altered, according to need, and removed properly, and kept or disposed for contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Others), low - risk activities have little social contact with the community and other peers.
Simple measures to protect against germs that are encouraged in all workplaces include washing hands frequently and kindly, encouraging workers to stay home when they are sick, encouraging good breathing habits including covering coughs and sneezes, performing home - and - bed massages, preparing them to work around the home or to keep up with each other, encouraging the workers to avoid using tools and equipment, and keeping the process of cleaning and killing germs in the workplace.
Early detection and quarantine of infected people may be a vital step in protecting employees, customers, watches, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with a system of scissors stay at home until they can't get heat, and some symptoms for at least 24 hours without using antidepressants, and that the rules for day care of the sick family member, allow workers to stay at home to care for these rules.
According to OSA, the physical tasks involved include those activities that require regular contact (.8 m) with people who are considered to be COVID-19 patients, who have been infected with the SARS-CoV2 virus because of ongoing social friction in a nearby community, or because someone has recently returned to a foreign land where there is a potential link with COVID-19.
These include staff members who can contact the public community as schools, high - level jobs, and high - risk market conditions. Creating control of these high - risk groups includes putting up high - risk groups, setting up high - speed air markets, establishing a high - traffic range system, setting limits as security boundaries, setting up traffic control limits for traffic traffic, driving traffic control programs for consumers, controlling high levels of the client population, and monitoring trade practices, and monitoring routines.
Workers in the case of the attack don’t usually need to use ambulances.
If a person begins to get ill in a plane, proper control programs for workers and other passengers include separating the patient from others by a distance of 6 points, placing one member of the crrew to care for the patient, and giving a face mask to the patient or asking to cover his mouth and nose when he coughs or sneezes.
The cager must wear gloves while tending a patient or affecting body defecating or areas that may be unclean, and there may be additional precautions if the patient has a fever, persistent cough, and difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other losses should be disposed of in a biohazard case, and the areas that have received pollution should be cleaned and contaminated later. In connection with the merchant ships, including travel ships and other passenger transport vessels, control the donkey includes stopping the journey when you are sick, and separating yourself and cherishing the treatment center as soon as someone begins to heat or other symptoms while riding.
If possible, medical follow-up should be damage to a separated patient. In schools and day- care facilities, the CDC encourages a temporary ban on cleaning and killing bacteria if an infected person has been inside the school building regardless of the spread.
If there is little or no room in the community, live - in separating techniques may be introduced as an invitation to thefield trips, meetings, and other large gatherings such as natural education, attending classes or meals in restaurants, increasing space between desks, coming in half and return times, marriage of less important visitors, and using a different office for children with flulike symptoms.
When the virus spreads dramatically in the community, in spite of efforts to isolate it, it may be considered closed schools. In law enforcement workers who carry on daily activities, the health risk of this time is considered low by the CDC.
Legislation workers who must contact persons who are confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as those of medical emergency workers, including appropriate personal safety products.
If there is a close connection when available, workers should clean and remove germs from their work belts and clothes before using them again with a spray or house cleaning cloth, and they should follow the usual procedure to prevent the spread of infection and the loss of operating and maintaining and washing of clothing.
The OSA considers that certain medical and cold personnel are at greater or greater risk of exposure to disease.
The activities of the most vulnerable include medical, relief supplies, bureaucratics, and medical transport personnel who are exposed to known patients or who are suspected of having COVID-19.
These become the greatest risk of infection when workers develop aerosol, or collect or handle samples, from known patients or suspects that they have COVID-19.
The procedures that develop the aerosol include abrasion of the body, procedures that cause coughing, bronchoscopies, procedures and examination of the teeth, or the collection of samples of the body.
Cold treatment activities include personnel involved in preparing the bodies of people who have known or who are suspected of having COVID-19; these become extremely dangerous during automation. More engineers of these risk groups include private rooms for known patients or suspected cases of COVID-19, which include the procedure for the establishment of aerosol.
Special air pressure pressure can be good for some health - care and cold systems.
Samples should be handled by the Biosafity Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients on arrival be separated into separate waiting sites for any suspected positive-19. In addition to the other PPE, Osha encourages respirators to those who work apart from known, or suspected, that they carry the SARS-CoV2 virus, and that those who develop aerosol procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH - approved or better - approved NIOSH scans must be used as a complete set of pre-respirators, which involves a physical examination, exercise, and medical examinations.
Some types of repirators can offer more protection and development to the employee's well-being. WHO does not encourage coverals, since COVID-19 is a disease that does not pass through body fluids.
The WHO only encourages the surgical masks with the crew cleaning in the entrance areas.
To those who collect a sample of the smell, care for, or deliver the COVID-19 patients without the development of aerosol, WHO encourages surgical checks, mirrors, or facilitate cheese, lawn, and gloves.
If an aerosol procedure is performed, N95 or FFP2 repirator is replaced by a surgical mask.
Because PPE is not available enough in the world, WHO encourages reducing the need for PPE by telephone contact, physical defenses as the window shows about it, which only allows those who are directly involved in the treatment to enter a room with CIVID-19, use only the appropriate PPE, and continue to use the same respirator without removal while caring for many patients with the same disease, watch out and control the availability of PPPPE, and avoid the use of plastic in people who have no symptoms of the disease.

PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS: [Covid-19] To reduce the burden and prepare for the future
DAY/FORMINATION: 14 March 20, 00:24 UTC
COUNTRY OF ORIGIN: CC0: No privileges granted
We find ourselves in a unique position this month.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic is a factor that makes it clear how people in the world are connected with one another's responsibility.
We have never been confronted with challenges like these, but we know that our response to it depends on the type of compassion we have in the world, the efficiency of the organization, and the structural structure of the society that is at the heart of this organization.
The cooperation and care we have seen in all our workers by means of e - mail, telephone calls, and chats is a remarkable guarantee that we have good fellow workers.
I am truly happy and proud to work with you.
Last week, someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
He reminded me of how reasonable it is for the earth to be able to open up Wipedia now, and this is a powerful sign with this key source that is always available to the Internet and is available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep open or do our employees paid for it or our communities.
The world needs the knowledge that is available in Wipedia, now more than ever.
This time, it is not only when we do what we do but also how we do it, which will have a profound impact on the earth.
Because of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will make significant changes in the way we deal with them, starting with the next summer.
Changes in our work with termites
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the bar-c has met yesterday and discussed how we will work with our host for the days and months to come.
In that discussion, we have considered what we feel will be the best response to our circumstances and the best way to keep the organization going during this time.
We should not expect to remove stress and support our long - term goal.
If you need to drive again, that is fine.
For all the workers, contract companies, and contract workers:
Our expected daily work will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the change is announced.
We do not announce a vacation - if you can work extra hours, the company can use it.
However, things are uncertain in the world now, and whether you need to care for loved ones, buy food, or go to a doctor, your health comes first.
We cannot follow up on a time that works well.
If you are sick, don’t work.
We don’t really have to say this, but we’ll say it.
You do not need to install sick days or PTO - you will simply tell your manager and help your fellow team to reprogram calendars and clubs to ensure that the major work parts are being accomplished.
( If you are diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus, please tell Bryan between T&C Ops so that the T&C can assist with support and ensure that your condition is properly cared for by the administrators).
Part - time workers will be paid to the full.
We have already said, and we are committing ourselves to fulfilling our obligations to our employers and to those who work hours.
Everyone will be paid for his regular working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes when you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we have our support.
Many people use work as a means to bring their stress to balance with the things around us.
What we are doing can have a unique reward, especially in times like this.
Again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We ask you to contact your manager, so that we know what we can expect and plan accordingly.
Some of the work assignments are taken seriously.
There are things that we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fudraing (in others) perform a critical task that may require further support.
We will begin the process with every door to investigate current goals and adjust our focus to support what is essential to our goal.
There is much that all of us need to do, only to concentrate on the most important projects of all.
Reducing now will not hurt us later.
We don't plan to "work again to catch the hangover" when the epidemic is over.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to finish at an unusual time right now.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work at setting new goals and times when they are appropriate.
What happens with the AP (Annual Planing)?
To change to our new circumstances and hours of work we expect every day, we intend to change our Annual Plan of20-2021.
Our aim is to suggest the expanding of our 2013-20 edition that allows more time for the work force to take priority, to take care of themselves, and to care for their loved ones while helping those who need or wish to work a reduced term within the next few weeks.
This stretching of the working age greatly reduces the current job schedule and the pressure it is exerted on the entire organization.
We will introduce what we suggest to Boaz about the coming week and will reward the representatives and teams on the following steps as soon as we have the assurance.
Thank you for the APP team for taking the lead in this regard.
Office structure, exposure, and cleaning
Last week, we read that one of our SF workers may be exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we sent a cleaning crew to remove germs from all parts of the San Francisco office.
Use hospital soap to remove germs everywhere, as well as in the reception area, and in the neighborhood of tourists and electrons that enter our area.
A building uses its own conservation protocol by using products that support the safety of its kernel.
We feel that the office will be right when we decide to return to it.
Our DC office is in We Work, which shared with us its COVID-19 protocol with all the DC staff.
Since last week, our DC office has moved to a remote area that has been completed in accordance with the direction given by San Francisco.
As our other NYC staff knew, we have been discussing renting in Brooklyn.
These conversations continue but may take a little time.
Some of our employees are working far away for the first time.
Our long - term employees know that it can be big changes, and they want to give you advice:
Cut back on meeting length for at least an hour or two.
If larger gatherings are needed, consider how you can arrange for them during several days.
Explain clearly what the meeting is about, go with the ya, and send things to be read in advance.
Do so often with video, using instruments such as Google Docs and Zoos to work and connect to each other alive.
Have someone to take the lead in organizing all the meetings, someone to look up the questions in the outline and follow up the speakers, and someone to help write notes (or make notes for all of you).
Send e-mail to those who support you in any way if you need a suitable headset.
Use your social money to buy what is on demand.
If you want to specify #remoths in Black to chat with your colleagues about the sent task
The HR Operations team needs guidance from Internet engineers with effective methods of operation to support the increase in the activity sent to the entire Company.
This past week we have invited all who receive a lower income from the community to protest public events supported by Wikimedias, such as showings, WHO until the epidemic is over.
We will tell them that we have come to understand that our request for a loan and that other restrictions would prevent them from finishing their work on land that was agreed upon and that no one would be paid for delays or change those goals.
This next week we will follow another direction to Wikimania and other national and regional councils.
The general feeling of the world’s population seems to be a loss of frustration but to be free of the interpretation and opportunity to concentrate on their communities, Wikimedia and so forth.
In time, the CRT works to filter a page on Malta-Wiki so that it can provide a public space to watch the impact and follow our discussions with them.
Keeping in touch with news related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar next Thursday, by 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special meeting for the staff.
We will use the time to share some responses, respond to your questions, and spend time with each other.
We work together and will help you wherever we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to receive information in these emails, along with all other vital information in connection with the COVID-19 key, from the Office Wiki.

B'Angiotsin-convening enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an external enzyme (in the lungs cell), the arteries, the heart, the kidneys, and the intestines.
ACE2 combats the operation of angiotsin-conning enzyme (ACE) by reducing the number of angiotsin-I and raising Ang(1-7) and making it a promising drug for treating heart disease and blood. ACE2 also serves as a place for entering the cells in certain coronaries.
The human enzyme is usually referred to as HACE2.
Angiotsin-convening enzyme 2 is a zic metalized medolloenzyme found in the face of the endorial and other cells.
ACE2 protocol contains the N-terminal terminal configuration M2 and the C-terminal terminal terminal renal amino acid exporter.
ACE2 is a protein of the membrane I-type type, with its enzymes exposed to the face of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer cells of the ACE2 cell are separated from the unit of transmembrane by a enzyme known as shedase, and the luminary protein that occurs is extracted from the blood and is eventually flushed out of the urine.
ACE2 is present in many body components: Ace2 is associated with the cell membranes of the second type of alvaric cells, small internal and bacterial cells, and the delicate tissue cells in many body parts.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and bransem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as ACE register.
ACE separates angiotsin I hormone from angiotsin I into vasoconstricating annotsin II.
ACE2 split the carboxyl-terminal into a virtual virtual terminal from animiosian II (Asp-Arg-Arg-Val-Yr-Yle-His-Po-Pro-PE) and split it into a vasodator anamotian (1-7), (H-Arp-Arg-Val-Yr-Ile-Yle-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also separate several other peptils including the[des-Arg9] bradykin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and perrelin.
ACE2 controls the movement of the neutral amino acid transmitter SLC6A19 and is linked to Hartnup disease.
Like a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as a primary entry for certain coronavirus cells, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-Cov2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Directly speaking, the combination of SARS-CoV - SARS-CoV2 plasma in ACE2 lymph nodes in the face of cells results in endocytics and in the passage of both bacteria and enzymes to the central cell.
This process of entry also requires that the Sprotein is made active by sterone protease TMPRSS2, a barrier under the current test as a cure for disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing the ACE2 ladders, in the cells, may help fight the virus.
However, many major organizations and operating bodies have encouraged continued with the general ACE barrier and ARV therapy.
"A review and analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "Use of ACE barrier was associated with a severe reduction of 34% in pneumonia's risk against control."
"Nonetheless," pneumonia's risk has been reduced to anti-ACE patients who have been at high risk for pneumonia, particularly those with strokes of stroke and heart.
"The use of ACE prevention has also been associated with the reduction of pneumonia patients, although the effects have been less serious than the damage that pneumonia can cause."
The human component ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new treatment for acute lung damage, and it seems to improve the pulmonary hemodynamics air output from the pigs with lipolysachardide-inced respiratory disease syndrome.
Half of the rhACE2 in people takes 10 hours to work and starts working after 30 minutes more than 24 hours (time).
One study shows that rhACE2 can be an appropriate drug for those who are unable to take insulin inputs (RAS in his system, which are common or in diseases when anginaots II rotates. The problem of rhACE2 has been examined in a medical research on the treatment of a respiratory disease.
"BOVID-19 apps are youth'Covid-19 programs designed to help find numbers concerning the 20th plague of the coronary epidemic, such as the process of detecting people (" contact") which may have been contacted by the infected person.
A number of programs have been developed or considered, with the backing of government law elsewhere.
Ventilation frames have been developed for building tracking Apps for the contact.
Privacy anxiety has been expressed, especially regarding the mid-based postagement of the application users.
Other methods that do not require confidential information involve the use of signatures in Bluetooth to replace the user’s position with other youths.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would build a way to support such vehicles in Bluetooth directly to the OS in the Andes and the OS.
In China, the Chinese government, collaborating with Alipay, has developed an app that allows residents to check whether they have been in contact with the people with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an App is used by the Trace Together.
"Epp was developed by local IT staff, released as an open spring and to be given by the government. In Northern Macedonia the "Stop Corona!" App worked with Bluetooth to track exposure to people who may be infected and to provide immediate reactions to health authorities.
The App was developed by the Institute of Technology and the Health Department.
Since April 14, 2020, this application was expected to be approved by the Google Place and the Applet's App Force.
"On April 12, the government said that the searchup was in the advanced stage of development, and it was to be available for discharge within a few weeks. The same App is being prepared for the same in Ireland, and in France ("Stop Covid").
Both Australia and New Zealand consider the Apps based on Singapore’s Trace Tourer and BlueTrace protocol. Russia aims to set up a show when one is crossing the limits of the infected patients living in Moscow-19, designed to ensure that they are not from the homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has listed a number of possible problems with the appma, including misleading precautions and the chances of not receiving warning if access to the App is limited to only a small number of people.
"To solve the problems related to the flow of the " " "e-connavirus"" "Apple has placed limits on the types of organisations which can include the Coronavirus access to its Apps Stores, which said it will be only those of the "Legal" or the trusted organisations.
The Google and the Amazon have established similar boundaries.
Conservative couples express their concern about the problems of detection by the mass of people using Coronavirus Apps, particularly about whether the search program developed to handle the Coronavirus epidemic will be traced after the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement that puts limits on this type of search.
These organizations have imposed nine restrictions on government projects:
"A search should be "Legal, necessary" and suitable "Advance"").
the passing of the period of caution and observation should have the conditions of sunset;
use of the data should be limited to the purposes of the COVID-19;
the protection of the dragon and the unknown of names will have to be protected and marked as a protection on the basis of evidence;
an indistinct investigation should avoid reducing the evils of discrimination and reducing the value of things;
any sharing of a table with other people shall have to be interpreted by the law;
there should be caution against misuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
"A helpful participation is all" who are "participers", which includes public health experts and small groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCCC) and theporters Without Borders (Reporter ehone Ginzen) (RSF) also produce survey lists.
The Google/Apple program aims to correct the follow-up problem by releasing the search tool from OS when you no longer need it.
Some countries that use searching the area based on the network rather than the Apps, eliminate both the need to install the App and avoid being followed.
In Israel, coded follow-based on the network was approved.
Resolved solutions based on a network that can extend to a fixed area can cause serious privacy problems.
However, not all masks have major servers to get to the length of the person’s space; the number of privacy masks has been built using large servers to connect only (see paragraph below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based volume was used to follow a person.
Instead of using the selected App, the brace collects information to different sources involving the tracking data for the young vortex and card counter, and combine this to send messages by text messages to people who may be infected.
In addition to using this information to warn people who might be infected, the government has also made knowledge of the environment available to the public, which is permitted because of many significant changes in the law of privacy after the MERMS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public by means of App and omnites. The countries involving Germany consider using both the main-sistant and the protection of privacy.
Since April 6, 2020, the information has not been published.
A code that protects privacy is a highly designed method, with many research books starting back in 2013. Since the 7 April 2020, more than 12 teams of experts are looking for solutions that accept privacy, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to interact with the user and other young ones.
PAPP-PT, however, is an attempt to communicate that contains both major and varied methods, and it is not a single protocol. Various protocols include Democratic Development-PPPLicide Policy Policy (DPPT/DPPP-3T), TTPORary Contact Units (TCN, FSanta Contact EverN, CEN), Privacy Special Security Protocol and Mentalism for Protection, Pacting (CT).
In these prosthetics, a human ring never leaves the flu, and all the links take place in the exchange.
The Province Group of MIT Media Lab has been developing Safepaths, a platform to use privacy protection techniques when it collects and uses a space or a shortcut to track the progression of COVID-19.
"It is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Taking Personal Development in an Epidemiic" published in March 2020. One similar attempt is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, the company that developed a scientific science which was first founded in MiT Media Lab.
Safety uses secure music technology to allow users to communicate with one another at a critical local and health level and with other users and lawmakers, without endangering the privacy of the chart.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCC Coalition was formed by groups united by what has been the same pattern as a very different protocol, with the goal of reducing the division, and allowing the worldwide application of search and warning equipment, an important factor in general acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they were making a call for a Blue Trade protocol used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the panels, the young Androd and the OS platforms, announced a means of identifying people, and declared that it would protect privacy, based on the Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography technology.
They also published features of the technology used in the symmetrical system.
In accordance with Apple and Google, mast is intended to be extracted in three categories:
government to allow governments to build official access to Coronavirus protection
the direct entry of this element to the OS and Android Godogle and Apple systems to correct continuous development and care problems by sending the mast first with OS returns, and then releasing it in the same manner after the threat has passed.
b'Dug repositioning (also known as re-profing, re-sing, re-sking, orrapeutic breaking) is the reuse of a prescribed drug for treating another disease or a different health condition from the one it was built up.

Major platform projects that developed to class I safety research include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (The founder of Article I and the target number: Modernna, mRNA-1273)
varil vector (Adravirus I founder and logical code: Can Sinino Biologics, Adenvirus type 5 vector)
As CEP scientists reported in April, 115 clients are in the early stages of the goal, and 78 are confirmed as bacterial terrorists (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 have been reported, but with very little public knowledge is available (probably organized or invented).
The II scans the safety of preuse and resistance, usually not planned, under the control of a fake medicine, and is still in many facilities, while more accurate, active doses are considered.
Article III’s research usually involves more helpers, which involves control groups, and the operation of a screening to prevent disease, while the most critical results are taken in the right amount.

B'Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious virus caused by a respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and asthma.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throats, nausea, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to the beginning of symptoms of the disease is usually five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
While most of these events result in symptoms of disease, others result in increased pneumonia and death of many organs.
Since April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is primarily spread among people who contact one another, usually by small droplets that come out when you cough, sneeze, or speak.
While the droplets leave in the air, they usually fall to the ground or onto objects rather than become germs in long distances.
People may also be infected by contacting infected areas and touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive in as much as 72 hours.
It is highly contagious during the first three days after the initial symptoms of the disease, although it can spread before the onset of symptoms of the disease and later screening areas of the virus. The most common method of testing is a transscript polymerase switch action (rRT-PR) by a snail tube.
The use of masks is encouraged by those who suspect that they are infected and their caregivers.
Opinions vary, some authorities say that they cannot be used, others say they are not used, and still others force them to be used.
At present, there is no specific goal or therapy against the COVID-19 virus.
Virus transmission has been found in many countries in all six areas of WHO.
Those who are infected may not have symptoms of a disease or have symptoms such as colds, colds, fatigue, and colds.
Symptoms of emergency disease include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or stress, confusion, difficulty in getting up, and blue faces and lips; encouraged to get a doctor’s help as soon as these symptoms become manifest.
Strange as it may seem, air - conditioning symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, or sore throat may appear.
The symptoms of disease in the mouth from the waist down to the waist like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been demonstrated by a variety of percent.
Some events in China started only with chest clumsiness and a heart beat.
In some, disease can spread into pneumonia, kill dozens of organs, and kill.
This is also called the age of the onset of symptoms.
The period of exposure of the symptoms of CIVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
7.5% of people who have symptoms during 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these without symptoms in transmitting it to others is not fully understood; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of infected people who do not display symptoms of disease is now known and is being studied, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected people have always had no symptoms while lying in a hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to involve cases of symptoms of disease in its daily figures on 1 April 1; of 166 infected persons that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms during their tests.
Both the cough and the saliva can carry the virus.
Public speaking produces a number of drops more than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can lead to about 4.5 feet [4.5 m] of matches.
Although the virus is not normally transmitted to the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it can be transmitted by breathing and that air storage in the corridors outside the rooms of the people released contaminated samples of the RNA virus.
Certain medical procedures such as bulmonary and cariopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the production of crystals to be pumped into the air and resulting in breathing.
While there is concern that the risk may be widespread, the risk is thought to be small, and the virus is highly contagious when people have symptoms; although outbreaks may occur before symptoms appear, there is little danger.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not fully clear how easily the virus develops, one person usually infects two or three persons. The virus lives for hours to days on objects.
In particular, it was found that the virus lives one day on the cardboard board, about three days in plastics and irons (ASSIS 304), and about 4 hours in a barrel 99%.
This varies, however, according to humidity and temperature.
Soap can also be useful if used properly; soap products reduce the protective coating of the virus, kill it, and remove it from the skin and other areas.
Other soaps, such as eselconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconte, are not effective. In Hong Kong research, saliva samples are taken two days after hospitalization.
For 5 out of 6 patients, the first sample showed the number of high infection, and the sixth patient showed the number of the highest infection on the second day after diagnosis.
The austrachete respiratry syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV2) is the worst, first by removing from three persons with pneumonia and exposed to many severe respiratory infections in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV2 virus are from the coronaviruss.
When outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which explodes its protective rifle. SARS-CoV2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected in a COVID-19 because the virus enters the primary cells called angiotsin-conning enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in large numbers of the two types of memory cells in the lungs.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein called "" spike" (peplomer) to connect with ACE2 and enter into the primary cell.
The most serious heart damage was inflicted on 12% of the infected persons admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and is most likely to occur in serious diseases.
The rates of cardiovascular disease are high, causing inflammation and immunologic illness during the increase of the disease, but serious heart attacks may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are most visible in the heart and involved in the workings of the heart.
The incidence of thronosis (3%) and venous thrombulbulism (25%) is found in ICU patients with the COVID-19 virus and may be related to poor prognosis. The discovery of COVID-19 cases of cases that were killed by COVED - 19 showed diffuse alveor damage (D), and dyxoccyte.
Although SARS-Cov2 contains ACE2-expressive respiratory proteins, patients with COVID-19 in particular have symptoms of systemic hyperflammation.
In particular, parathogenic GM-CSF-separating T-cells appear to conform to the discovery of IL-6-separating logins and the causes of serious lung disease in patients with COVID-19.
Immphocytic infiltrates have also been reported during autopsies.
WHO has published a number of microbiologists.
The normal test method is a replication call for keyaction (hrT-PCR).
Tests are usually done in respiratory samples obtained from the tap tube; however, a nose tube or a sputum sample can also be used.
The results are usually achieved within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but this requires two sets of blood that are taken within two weeks and the results have less significance at the time.
Chinese scientists have been able to separate half of the coronavirus and to print the sequence of compounds so that laboratorys worldwide can develop polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) tests to identify the virus by disease.
Since April 4, 2020, an examination of the components of the disease (which can detect active microbes and have been infected) has been under way, but it has not been widely used.
The Chinese findings in survey show that accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first medical examination on March 21, 2020 that was used at the end of that month. The testing guidelines published by the Zongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested ways to identify the virus based on the aspects of treatment and the risk of disease control.
Bilateral multime-glass receivable with peripheral, ammetry and posterior are common in infection.
Subsection therapy, crazy paving (lobular heeling with varule alcohol profile), and consolection may occur as the disease progresses.
Little is available for microscopic radiation and cospirology of COVID-19.
The key factors found in research are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, percarditis, lung connection, and pulmonary edema
Four types of pneumonia’s weight can be seen:
common pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneucyte hyperplasias, large apithical pneumocyte, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic intation and multinalclientated cell structure structure.
acute pneumonia: diffuse alveor damage (DAD) and diffuse anlveor exadates.
AD is the cause of a sucite respiratory disorder (ARDS) and the hypoxemia.
cooked pneumonia: a mixture of exbuodates in alcohol cigarettes and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: dissaturated intersular colulation (DIS); leukoerythroblasts reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying in the home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for about 20 seconds, getting accustomed to keeping your mouth and nose clean, and avoiding contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC encourages to close your mouth and nose with a throat when you cough or sneeze and encourages the use of the snail's inside if there is not.
Good hand washing after coughing or sneezes is encouraged.
The CDC encourages the use of masking while in the public, in part to reduce infection from people who have no symptoms. Separate techniques are intended to reduce contact between infected people and large groups by closing schools and workplaces, preventing travel and exposing large gatherings.
Distance regulations include staying apart at least 6 feet (1.8 m).
"No known medication is effective in preventing the COVID-19. Since the goal is not expected until 1921, the leading control method of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the number of those who are infected, called "to make the line flat."
The CDC also encourages people to wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty, before eating and after contracting, coughing, and sneezes.
It also encourages the use of at least 60% alcohol-spacing, but only if soap and water are not readily available. In areas where hand - to-hand tires are not easily available, WHO provides two ways of producing it locally.
In these ways, the work of an anti microbial comes from ethanol or aisopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help rid the bacteria pores from alcohol; "it' is not killing the virus in handwashers".
Glycerol is fitted to create moisture.
People have been treated with care, which may include fluid treatment, oxygen treatment, and support of other important organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus wear a normal facial mask.
The extracorpole membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to solve the respiratory problem, but its benefits are still considered.
Hygiene, health, and healthful food have been encouraged to prevent infection.
Physical therapy may be helpful to those who have newly infected symptoms. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published suggestions to care for hospital patients with COVID-19.
Intensives and U.S. pulmonologies include methods of treatment from various schools at a free source, the IBCC.
Since April 2020, there is no way of treating COVID-19.
When symptoms appear, some doctors encourage paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen.
Measures must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in medical facilities where methods may produce aerosols, such as invasion or non-ind ventilation.
For doctors who care for patients with CIVID-19, the CDC encourages the preservation of the Airborne Infraction Listen (AIR) in addition to using general measures, to avoid contact and inhaling the virus. The CDC explains the instructions for the use of personal protein equition (PPE) during the epidemic.
Requirements: PPE, respirator or facial mask, eye protection, and gloves. When available, repirators are encouraged.
N95 respirators are authorized to be used in factories but FDA authorizes masks to be used under Emergency Use Administration (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air as dust, but the protection of a particular body unit is not guaranteed for its use.
If masks are not found, the CDC suggests using masks or, if there is no other way, automatic masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not too bad to require radio navigation or other means, but some need.
The type of respiratory support related to COVID-19 is still being studied by patients in the hospital, and there is some evidence that the invasion can also be avoided by high fluke nasal cannonoula or bi-table pressure.
Whether these two events lead to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with an invulnerical ventilation when it is available because this method reduces the spread of absorbed particles compared with the high flu and salnula. The worst conditions are common in adults (over 60 years of age, and especially more than 80).
Many developing countries do not have adequate hospital beds, which reduce the number of cases that make it impossible to handle the sudden increase in the number of CIVID-19 people who need hospitalization.
One study in China found 5% in the intensive care area, 2.3% needed assistance with the ventation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30 percent of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 were finally installed in the ICU.
Prevention machines become more complicated as acute respiratory disorder (ARDS) developed in COVID-19 and breathing becomes increasingly difficult.
Oventitors with high - pressure modes and PEEPs are needed to increase oxygen exposure while reducing the risk of lung damage associated with ventilates and pneutorex.
PEP may not be found in older 23:0 operators.
Medical research began on January 2020, and a number of antiviral drugs are on medical research.
Remedivir appears to be the most effective.
Although 211 might still be introduced, a number of new medicines are already approved for alternative or advanced research.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people who have a serious infection.
WHO encourages volunteers to take part in research on the effectiveness and safety of drugs that can be used. The FDA temporarily prescribes convasive plasma as a treatment that is being studied in cases where there is serious side effects.
It is not yet in the medical research needed to demonstrate that it is safe and effective in treating disease.
In February 2020, a youth's lab to handle an outbreak was developed in China.
Users are asked to enter the name and ID number.
This app is able to see 'if you are close to a person' using a detector that could be a risk to infection.
All users can take note of the situation of three other users.
If a potentially dangerous situation appears, the App not only encourages social isolation, but also warns the health authorities. A great deal of analysis of the age of the youth, the ability to observe the face, the following youth's phone and newly invented information is used to transport infected people and infected people to South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track the phone level of a young person who is thought to have a coronary disease.
This is done to keep them separate from society and to protect those who may contact infected citizens.
In March 2020, the Deutsche Telem shared the data of the German telephone area and government service, the Robert Koch Institute, to study and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia developed an eye - catching technology in order to find breakers of social isolation.
"The Italian state health officer Giulio Gallala said that he had been told young employees that "" 40% of the people are going around."
The German government has pursued a 48-hour-hour computer competition for the weekend of 42,000 players.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulad, has issued a national declaration of resolutions to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus.
People may experience bouts of loneliness, loss of movement, side effects of treatment, or fear of being infected.
"BBC encapsulate Rory O'Connor says," ongoing social isolation, loneliness, concern for health, depression and economic collapse is a storm that damages people's minds and their well-being."
The virus may have fewer or less side effects, similar to other common respiratory infections like a common cold.
Common infections have healed within two weeks, whereas those infected with a serious or serious infection can take from three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at increased risk for a type of COVID-19 virus on the basis of damage from other common viruses, such as SARS and MEORS, but in some people, CIVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
For those who are seriously affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop a respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) and cause damage to the respiratory system, the sprock or multiple organs.
The problems associated with COVID-19 include sopsis, bnormal resolution and heart, kidneys, and liver.
Clotting arsmarrities, especially the increase in prothrombin time, are found 6% of those who are admitted to the hospital because of the COVID-19, while kidney dysfunction is seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of persons with COVID-19 show high liver enzymes.
According to the same report, the average period between the onset of symptoms of disease and death is ten days, and five are taken to the hospital.
However, patients who are transferred to ICU have about seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early events, the average period from the onset of early symptoms of disease to death was 14 days, which is the total number of six days to 41.
In a National Health Commission (NHC) survey in China, the average mortality rate for males is 2.8% whereas the mortality rate for women is 1.7%.
Pharmaceutical models of autopticated lungs show diffuse anlveor damages and cellul fibroxoid ehudates in both the lungs.
The transformation of the vibral capatic was seen in the pneumocytes.
The lung photo showed acute respiratory radiation syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, heart injuries were noted in the higher levels of the troponin or heart condition.
According to the March issue from the United States, 89 percent of those admitted to the hospital already had diseases. The discovery of medical and economic and regional factors can contribute to the death of people.
Estimates of human deaths due to infection vary from region to region, but also because of difficulties in methods used.
Fewer adverse circumstances can cause more deaths than expected.
However, the fact that death is the result of previous infections can mean that the mortality rate is now low.
Smokers have a range of 1,1.4 times greater risk of detecting the critical symptoms of COVID-19 and are about 2.4 times more likely to receive emergency care or death compared with nonsmokers. It has been expressed by concern about long-term pre-bacterial diseases.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found a drop of 20% to 30% in the working of some infected people, and lung scans that indicate that it is likely to be injured.
This can also lead to the virus after a severe treatment after recovery.
In March 2020, it was not known that the previous virus could help with effective and long- term protection for people recovering from the virus.
Protection from the virus appears to be possible, based on other coronaviruss, but conditions have been reported in which the recovery of the COVID-19 has been followed by a critical examination of the coronavirus.
These conditions are thought to be a rise in the virus rather than a reemergence.
It is thought that the virus is natural and that it evolved from animals, then from humans.
The exact origin is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost entirely guided by transfer from one person to another.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published on January 2020 in Lancet, indicated that the first day of outbreak of symptoms of disease was December 1, 2019.
The official documents of WHO reported that the first symptoms of disease occurred on December 8, 2019.
Several methods are widely used to calculate the mortality of people.
The figures vary from region to region and from time to time and depend on the level of testing, the level of medical science, medical care care, time from the beginning to the characteristics of people such as age, sex, and health.
Toward the end of 1920, WHO distributed the urgent CD-10, U.S.A., which was killed by the SARS-CoV2 confirmed tab virus and U07.2 killed by the COVED-19 by doctors and editors except for the full-fected SARS-CoV2 virus. The rate of deaths shows the number of those who died in the pre-counted period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the mortality rate for the world's virus is 6.9% (153,822/2.24,191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies from region to region. Other measures include the case factority rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of infected and infected persons killed by the virus, and intality radiation (IFR), which represents the percentage of people who are infected (wearred and uninfected) who are killed by the virus.
These figures are not based on time and are followed by a number of people from infection to problem solving.
Although not all infected people are infected with the agents of the disease, the presence of the antibodies can give information as to how many people are infected.
In a large area of Italian infection, Castiglione d'Adda, a small area of 4,600, 80.7%) are already dead.
In Gangel, the virus was spread by Carnival conferences, and it was introduced into young people, which resulted in lower mortality rates, and not all those who died by COVID-19 were officially recognized as infected.
Furthermore, the German health unit has not yet had large numbers.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may be infected, as blood donors have tested.
669 (0.004% of the population) are assured that they were killed by COVID-19.
The toll of the epidemic and the mortality rate differs from that of men and women.
The mortality rate is higher for males in China and Italy.
The biggest risk for men is by 50 years of age, and the gap between men and women is limited to 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The underlying reasons for these differences are unknown, but genetic and moral factors can be a factor.
The difference in sex - based infections, the lower number of women who smoke as well as men who suffer from other conditions such as hypertension at an early age than women can contribute to a higher rate of death among dying males.
In Europe, 57% of infected people are male and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government does not follow the sexual data of the COVID-19 virus.
Studies show that increasing infections such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health - care workers, mostly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be infected.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the virus would be "COVID-19".
WHO official Tedros Adhanno Ghebreyus explained that CO stands for the corona, VI stands for the virus, D stands for the disease, and 19 signifies the year on which the first outbreaks are marked: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen not to be given a name for a specific area (such as China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with the proposals of different countries intended to prevent discrimination. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called respiratory disease 2 (SARS-CoV2).
The WHO also uses "COVID-19" and "A virus which causes COVID-19" in public discussions.
"Both disease and infection are usually called "coronavirus".
"During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO suggested that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov acuvi respiratory disease as names to be used for infection and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidelines against the use of sites in terms of disease and viruses.
The official terms of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Because of the lack of products in the mechanical industry, some manufacturers print medical materials such as the moths and parts of the plantilator.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed aventitor valve, and the surgeon could not send it when needed, the local company used his equipment and printed 100 valves needed overnight.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, assumptions, false and misleading stories appeared as regards the origin, the spread, the ban, the treatment and other aspects of the disease and were quickly spread to the Internet.
Humans seem capable of transmitting the virus to other animals.
Studies have failed to provide evidence of the influx of pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no prescribed medication or goal to treat the disease.
International research of the goals and medicines of the COVID-19 are conducted by government agencies, schools and industrial research.
"In March, the World Health Organization started "AVENTIONAL Research" to examine the effects of the treatment of four available anti-bacterial drugs with high hopes that it will be effective.
There is no vaccine available, but various websites work to develop vaccines.
The previous SARS-CoV function is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 both use ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three effective vaccines are examined.
First, researchers intend to develop a vaccine.
The goal of using a virus such as this, invalid or dead, is to develop the body's reaction to the new COVID-19 virus.
The second method, subunit vaccines, is to establish a goal that the immune system responds to certain aspects of the virus.
If SARS-CoV2 is, such research focuses on a S-spike protein that helps the virus enter ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third method is the goals of nucleic acid (the goals of DNA or RNA, a new method of building a goal).
The goals examined in any of these ways will be considered for security and employment. On 16 March 2020, the first medical study of this goal began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The goal contains a code of harmless genes copied from the virus that causes the disease. Development based on the properties of disease has been suggested as a challenge to the development of the SARS-COV2 goal, but this is not guaranteed.
More than 300 medical studies continue since April 2020.
Seven studies have been studying the treatment already prescribed for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Recycling drugs make up most of China's research, and a nine - grade study of remmusivir II in a number of countries will send a report toward the end of April.
The powerful return to the establishment of the medical goal of COVID-19 and alternative medicine had begun, in April 2020. A number of anti-bacterial drugs are being studied in the treatment of COVID-19, including remlovir, chlorochroroquine and hydrochroquine, rotor and lopinavir/ritonovar/ritonivir.
There was visible evidence of remesivir activity, in March 2020.
The progress in patient treatment that has been manifest in the effective use of remesivir.
The medical research of Article III is conducted in U.S., China and Italy. chloroquine, previously used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with unauthorized results.
However, research results are being proposed.
Health officials in Korea and China recommend chloroquine to be used.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although encouraging a daily amount of one gram, notes that the figure is twice higher and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued permission to be used in emergency conditions for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine by doctors who treated patients with COVID-19. The 7 codes of China included interferron, biofenovir, orumiphenvir in the treatment of COVID-19.
The unenforced data indicates that the high Ribalin doses are necessary to prevent SARS-CoV2 from inviro.
Ntaboxonide has been suggested in a continuing study of the vino-CoV2 prevention of SARS-CoV2. Research shows that the first increase in protein piming through transmembane protea model 2 (TMPRSS2) is the key to SARS-CoV2 entry by ACE2.
The research of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, along with or without it, has large limits to the health community in obtaining this treatment without further research. Oselamivir does not prevent SARS-CoV2 from the microtrotro and has an unknown role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine test may be a problem in the later stages of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine can have an anti-cytokine testum. Toyzimib has been added to medical guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after the completion of a small study.
An unanimated 2 study was conducted in the Italian nation after showing serious effects on people with a serious disease.
It is combined with serumferritin tests for cytokin shocks, intended to prevent the occurrence of this, which is thought to be the cause of certain deaths.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was authorized by the FDA based on previous research on treating steroid refuctory cytokine syndrome, CAR T, in 2017.
So far, there is no random, manageable evidence that tocilimab is effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of the highly vaccinated and active substances supplied by the immune system of those who are recovered from the COVID-19 persons in need is examined as a means of non-invasion protection.
This method was tried in SARS and the results are unknown.
Rival neutralation is the expected method used in which mild treatment of disease components can cause protection against SARS-CoV2.
However, other options, such as cellular cytotoxicity based on the elements of disease and/or phagocytosis, are possible.
Other therapies, for example, that are used by patients with the same cell types, are developed.
The production of a convalcent serum, which contains a blood - plasma component from healthy patients and contains the antibodies associated with the virus, can be promoted to speed up the use.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenling, a physician at the Central Hospital of WUhan, who later became infected and died because of a COVID-19 conditioning.
