Researchers are developing a standard that is comparable to that of the stars.
This is also a very difficult problem to solve and will require many years before valuable communication devices are available.
The needle gets lighter and lighter because of the force it is in.
The force is produced because water molecules are more concentrated in the water pressure than they are by air molecules above it.
