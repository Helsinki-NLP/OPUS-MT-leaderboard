You have to get there.
Why at home?
Asa and his father.
Do not hold back.
I am new here.
I shall not be afraid.
We know what you do.
How does your father feel?
I know what they said.
Why don’t we go there together?
We will see each other again!
Abstinence!
I don’t have a place to live.
Yes, you can.
Last year, I became the first child of my first child.
I am sure that I have ever seen her.
You are a good person.
Where is your family?
The best way to do so would be to avoid going.
Food shortages.
I am a university student.
I left my key behind.
We are not alone.
I want you to know them.
What are the benefits?
Each one knew what was expected of him.
It made me think.
I am one of your students.
Why not learn French?
Not necessarily.
I want to see you.
I’m glad you are there.
When does it arise?
Does Tom know why?
What is my schedule?
We don’t have money.
Forgive me!
I do not need them.
I talked to my parents about everything.
There is no other way.
I know what to do.
I know where he is.
Yes, indeed.
Not only does it wither but it is also wither.
I lost my pencil.
When do you stand up?
You can find any of the colors you would like to see in your heart.
He cooked all the dough.
They have no money.
You are a good parent.
Come or come?
I want to take you.
Do you want to be rich?
I had a headache.
If you don’t hear, they will come.
This is my father.
I’m curious about that.
What does he not understand?
I don’t think he is here.
I can’t believe it.
He is described as very wealthy.
His Word was remarkable.
I don’t want to cook.
Do not do that again.
She knows each other very well except her parents.
I was able to do it.
I don’t think he is here.
It was desire.
The sun shines directly overhead.
Why not?
It will be very good.
That’s OK.
I remember that first.
Do you want to take them?
Name - calling?
You will surely agree with that statement.
My sister is not at home.
My parents called me aunts.
What are they doing here?
Do you have a brother?
Now look at the picture.
I’m in a car.
What are you able to do?
Is this your mother?
Why are the heavens like blue?
If you do not, they will come.
That car is our home.
No one here in the car.
The choice is ours!
I don’t know the word.
Light.
I’m glad you are there.
Are you looking for them?
Remember!
Why is this fact significant?
They don’t give me a chance.
My daughter is getting married in the sixth month.
I know these women.
I understand what you say.
It makes me feel sick.
Where do you know my name?
Do you want to, or do you want to?
Is this love?
Do you know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, July, August, October, November and December are 12 months of the year.
I have a question.
I knew you were married.
Are you traveling?
In the past, he was a teacher.
Be approachable.
I did!
Who Do You View Me?
I see it that way.
You want to see them.
Commitment is the debt.
He is not with you.
I don’t like these people.
Do you want something to drink?
Are you happy?
Absolutely!
She listened.
It seemed as if it were a problem for you.
Take a taxi to get you into a hotel.
You are not coming, are you?
He is here!
Give it up.
I don’t know how long.
Whose hand is this?
Should I Get Baptized?
Not at all!
Each one knows what is expected of him.
Do not look down.
I’ll ask her.
We return.
I’ll see you.
I know a lot about you.
That’s OK.
I want to learn French.
My car died.
You know that I love you.
I knew him.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what is happening.
She left the key of her car.
Why didn’t you come to my home?
Can I see it again?
Do you know the difference between the sheep and the goats?
You don’t know my brother.
I’m taking you to school.
Do I know Tom?
Are you satisfied?
Will I ever see my loved one again?
That is why I love you.
Are you in your home?
There will be heat.
Send me a copy of the book.
Early on.
It’s too hot.
You know that I love you.
The bed is extremely warm.
Our trip comes from time immemorial.
I received the money.
What would you like to see?
How do you go to school?
Are you new?
I know what needs to be done.
Do you enjoy studying?
Do you have money for me?
I don’t know.
I know how to do this.
Which sandals?
I’m glad you are there.
This book is a masterpiece.
Thank you for killing our family.
I respect them.
Absolutely!
He is powerful.
This is worth five dollars.
I moved to my mother’s house.
Yes.
Your lung is dirty.
I am around you.
Thank you.
Do you enjoy studying?
I will give it to you.
Drink a refreshment.
I want to.
You are my friend.
Where is our car?
Each one knows what is expected of him.
Which school do you attend?
You do not want to know!
He is a good student.
They pop up unexpectedly.
Accept the book and read it.
I don’t have a house.
Thank you very much.
I know you said that.
I thought.
He is happy.
I was hungry.
It’s a friend.
Do not be that way.
I wish you had returned home.
My daughter is quite young.
He was raised by his grandmother.
I shall rescue him.
I want to go home.
They do not know.
I have my brother.
This was my dress, for I had made it.
How long do you want to last?
Early the next morning, I left home at two in the morning.
I threw away my glasses.
Why were they here?
What is love?
We understand.
I love this book.
Please read on.
You are my dear wife.
I’ll be happy with you.
It is ours.
Where is your family?
Do not say this again.
Good morning, I’ll send it back to you.
Where are we going?
I’m not sure.
You know where I will be.
What is the purpose of your visit?
We are happy to see them.
I know that girl.
Stop the car.
I’m not sure.
Do You Know What to Do?
We know.
No, you thank him.
Where do you want to live?
I love the place I live in.
Do not doubt.
Give Your Life Meaning, 7 / 1
Rain wells.
Where are you going?
Do not be surprised at how enthusiastic you are.
You have to go home.
Is he here?
Do you learn French?
You will be moved to repentance all the more.
Come on out to meet me.
Where is my car?
I don’t know how.
I saw my brother there.
I know what I do.
I gave a book to my son.
Who is your teacher?
I do it for you.
This girl wears herself like a boy.
I don’t have a brother.
Sadly, when my older friend moved, he moved to another town.
Leave your home?
You know I need to go.
This is your book.
It is not my day.
How long will he suffer from illness?
If he had stayed home that day, he would have been accident free.
He speaks not only English but also German.
I was not happy.
I know what is happening.
I know you know.
Right, wrong?
I know what you think.
Hyacinth.
I was not good enough, so I had to change it.
The best way to do so would be to avoid going.
This girl wears herself like a boy.
I love to see you there.
I have to work on my hair.
Too Little?
The owner of the property is my brother.
I am happy and content.
Do you have time to help me with something?
Give him a copy.
I don’t know them by name.
Do You Know What Love Really Is?
The marriage takes place on the sixth.
I didn’t get sick.
Tell me your goal.
Is this a separate table?
I lost my pencil.
Thank you for coming.
I’m a cook.
Someone is standing behind a wall.
I left school.
Keep it positive.
Did you notice it?
Are they seeing us?
Are you a good worker?
After my flight up the hill, any crack will be left over.
Is there a wheat class?
We have come to see you.
They are children.
“ Let’s say, Tom, have a good time!
Remember to deliver a letter.
I know he loves me.
There was a way to look for them.
I too am attending school.
I don’t have a brother.
I struck with a bullet on my finger.
What do you see?
It’s shameful.
Do you know where?
Where is your father?
Do not ask me again.
My father is at home.
I don’t even have a shot.
Are they Japanese?
Give me a book.
You are a good person.
These windows move south.
I forgot to buy bread.
I shall walk in the day of God.
We can’t see it.
Where do you come from?
We are here for you.
I don’t know where he lives.
There are 100 people in the hall.
I understand.
She has no teeth.
Not for Me.
My dream had come true.
You can stay close to me.
I don’t know what to say...
Do you know where?
I am not a university student.
Let me see.
Are you our spouse?
Do good to those hating you.
Not one.
It’s too thin.
Scientists do not do it today.
We are supremely happy.
The girl is beautiful.
Come visit me.
I am not a good carpenter.
It’s a friend.
Tell them what happened.
I wish you had returned home.
I have done it for you.
I love your car.
Who is your teacher?
Are you sure you are home?
Does that appeal to you?
It should.
Undoubtedly.
Have I done that?
I do not know him.
I’m glad you are there.
I need a lot of comfort.
I quit.
Make no mistake about it, you might judge things differently.
I don’t know what to think about.
I don’t know what to do.
What accounts for this?
Where am I?
Do you know his name?
The money ran out.
I want to buy a car.
I want to attend too.
They look bad.
What is your hour?
We missed each other.
Just think!
I left my key behind.
I’m not a fluent speaker.
I don’t expect you to be restricted today.
I want you to.
You will find this home, which is my home.
Your car warms my heart.
He is described as very wealthy.
No one can be certain.
Either you are going or you are not?
We go anyway.
Originally, there was a temple.
I know you said that.
Oh, skinny.
Why not go home?
Do you feel that way?
They don’t give me a chance.
What would you like to see?
Why do you ask?
He is here!
They don’t look at me with an air of pity.
I’m sure you’re good at it.
Get your way.
I know the girl.
They did not die.
You are a good parent.
Are you looking for a car?
I don’t have any money.
Do your schoolwork.
I want to accompany you.
All I know is his name.
Asa and his mother.
I will make you happy.
We can see that.
What is the family like?
I speak little Spanish.
Come on!
How old is he?
I have to know why.
You are not our brother.
My family is small.
Does Tom know the reasons for it?
At home?
I love mathematics.
I know.
Not one.
Nothing happened.
We see each other.
Not at all!
Where is Tom?
Do not be afraid.
Where did you come from?
I don’t know enough of French.
When do you walk?
They have no money.
Tell them what happened.
What is this phone number?
We are paralyzed.
It is not mere theory.
Let me explain.
Sooner or later.
They saw him.
Is all the travel worth it?
I don’t expect you to be restricted today.
He nodded.
Are you our spouse?
It is not something to boast about.
Go up!
I love this car.
I know where to turn.
Yours is similar to yours.
How much is it worth?
Move them away.
Not on the outside!
Where do you want to live?
Be observant.
She listens.
Remember to deliver a letter.
We are here for you.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
Get your shoes off.
They know us.
When do you stand up?
I will not give up.
I am from England.
You will surely agree with that statement.
Let me explain.
Windows now open.
You don’t have to come.
She listened.
I never forgot it.
I don’t think he is here.
That’s OK.
Rice is processed here.
I know.
He did not ask.
They want us to do so.
What do you see outside?
I know you will be happy.
I shall not go away.
Where is Tom?
Is it French?
The owner of these books is my sister.
From day to day, we may be able to take us to work.
We arrived.
I am learning French at home.
Thank you for listening to this presentation.
I know where they are going.
It is a remarkable book.
Our feet are heavy.
I know your father.
I am learning French in school.
You have to go home.
Where do all people go?
Can You Open a Window?
Are you going here?
Where is my mother?
Not now, when?
What do you want?
Where is your car?
My father was not at home.
That’s OK.
What do you know?
We need to do so.
Are you looking for them here?
No rich people here.
There are holes in the ground.
A carpenter.
It’s good to see you.
My father was not at home.
Look!
What is this phone?
You can sing the song.
Forgive me so much!
I know how to do it well.
We’re not hungry.
I think you can learn that.
Where are we?
Love is not jealous.
Let me explain.
I know you do.
I’m not a student.
I’ll try.
The strong winds blow, and I can’t move quickly.
Maybe you do not.
I noticed that one of my sisters was there.
I do not give up.
How Much Time Will You Have?
Asa and his Father.
What are these?
You’ve got it.
My house is next to the place of worship.
Disspelled!
All drops that fall from the ground will be eaten by the pigs.
I couldn’t look.
I do not want to read them.
No one knows his name.
Do you know where they were?
Where do you go to school?
Where are you?
What a thought!
He gave it to me.
I never saw him.
Where is this famine?
We listen.
Why do people say this?
The washad sheets are of great value.
I swore.
I don’t speak French anymore.
No one!
Why do I have to do it?
It is Saturday.
So I did that.
I’m a cook.
How many?
We have no money.
I know you’re listening.
Get rid of your shoes.
I know what it looks like.
I was delighted.
Is this a new car?
Why don’t you go in?
He did not read the book.
I don’t want to be rich.
You forgive me for saying that.
The insect has no teeth.
This will make you happy.
You can move there.
When will you come home?
He did not read the book.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This book is a new one.
A carpenter.
She is a Frenchman.
I don’t have a car.
Care for your head.
Why not make it clear what you have in mind?
I want you to meet me.
You can use the car.
He does not attack.
He is a teacher.
I came to love him.
I’m not a student.
Would you like to see this?
Do not put that up with that!
I love you.
He came on his own.
I bought eggs and eggs.
One fold is missing.
I never saw him again.
Is this your mother?
We grew up as a single parent.
For what purpose?
Are you looking for us?
I’ll be in my car.
I don’t like running.
She is a Frenchman.
He is a very tall son.
I know who they are.
You know how well you can do that.
I have a car.
When will you come home?
In the evening, from 6: 00 p.m. to 6: 00 p.m., it is a time to be joyful.
You must not come.
You have to stop drinking.
Show concern for your mother.
There was a way to look for them.
Where did you stop the car?
Date between 1 hour and 2 hour
Let the one who has a fever strike down in the mouth.
Shall I wear a rag or a rag?
Which book?
The Americans?
What do they look like?
Let me explain.
I’m reading a book.
Read!
I don’t know.
Not necessarily.
Where are we going?
Which are your values?
What is the error?
Drink.
He is here!
I Will Not Forget It
I will give you my life a hug.
We are happy.
Keep it covered and in good condition.
I don’t respect it.
I carry them.
Food shortages.
I understand.
Sadly, no.
I am learning French in school.
Why?
I want you to go home.
Asa and his mother.
Do you seek me out?
Put it in your mother’s arms.
You know I need to go.
Where is the automobile?
Do you love him?
We must put an image between outputs and inputs.
The serpent caused a snake, or serpent, to appear to bite.
They do not come today.
Do You Know What to Ask?
Open the Window
What a home!
The son is a brother.
Why Not Go to School?
Why not go home?
Can I get in?
You know that I love you.
Researchers have found a skeleton in a cave.
Our journey is up to the hour.
Can I see them again?
These steps can prevent an epidemic from becoming a reality.
I am the factory.
We are told to eat together in the day.
Do not lose your temper!
Not a conversation; we simply go to the movie anyway.
I fell in love with her.
Why not go home?
Get out of my room!
I am new here.
I want to learn French.
I am coming to you.
I’m not my sister.
I slept without cause.
I have a boss.
The waters overwhelmed.
If I had, I would have gone.
I try to express my thoughts and feelings in words.
What is the price?
I know where we are.
Why not?
I’m going to get my car back.
Why are you not in school?
We are university students.
I don’t know his name.
I shall lack nothing.
How do you go to school?
Forgive me!
Allow them to do so.
Do not put it off!
Do you know what it is?
You forgive me for saying that.
I know his family.
I know.
I left my key behind.
I understand this.
They don’t give me a chance.
What is the purpose of your visit?
Why not?
He does not speak English.
I ate eggs the next day.
Right, wrong?
We know him.
I want to get some rest.
He did not ask.
We’re not hungry.
I was in a state of shock.
I talked to my parents about everything.
I wake up at 4: 00 a.m.
Do not open the window.
Go ahead and pretend.
Why not?
Why the heat?
Unless it is raining, he goes to work.
It is ours.
Do not look at the matter objectively.
How does your sister feel?
Can We Talk?
Where are you taking us?
I loved the car.
Why learn French?
I think so.
I have seen them.
I know who you are.
He accused the man of stealing.
This was my dress, for I had made it.
I am not listening.
I don’t know their names.
Talk about your goal.
I know what to do.
He is described as very wealthy.
Your lung is dirty.
Are you not a German?
Do you love him?
"Let these trucks be popular?" – "Our Father."
You don’t need to be ungrateful.
When did you meet the next evening?
We want you to take them.
Asa and his mother.
In the privacy of our home, let us enjoy ourselves.
We visited you there.
Do you want to, or do you want to?
It’s not my car.
I don’t know his name.
Do you want something to drink?
You do not know what has happened, do you?
I know what love is.
Not one.
The horse is growing.
What are you doing here?
I am the factory.
She doesn’t give me any explanations.
We are studying in the same class.
Where?
It made me think.
Do you have rice?
Is he here?
We can find it.
We are born.
I know why you are here.
Why are you pursuing higher education?
Where is this famine?
Sooner or later.
When will you be there?
I've dropped here.
Thanks.
Listen to your mother!
Read this.
I will give it to you.
What news?
They are in my room!
What kind of bread is this?
Do you want something to drink?
I am the youngest.
How much is it worth?
I would like to read this book.
I left Bresil.
I’ll take you home.
We are studying in the same class.
Do Not Miss the Purpose!
Write to us.
Do not give up trying.
Do you have this money?
They are very thin.
It is his job.
That is what you have asked for.
He is our brother.
What do you want?
Buyers?
It was desire.
I want to.
Don’t give orders here!
One time we go to a movie.
Is that not so?
What did you read about in the book?
Where are we?
Why do we do it?
These are extremely tall.
Do you believe that it does not matter to me?
In the dry season, we maintain a high standard of living.
He is our brother.
It is his job.
Do you know what they have to say?
I’m not sure.
They do not know.
Is he an American?
A cup or a tea?
What is going on in the lower?
I’m sorry I threw you out of the hole.
We are alone.
I love what I do.
My voice has been heard for some reason.
Do you know what he said?
His Word was perfect.
When do you want to go?
I’m not sure of that.
Is this better?
The Japanese?
I’ll try.
Does he or she know that you love him?
We are wasting precious time.
Why not?
Get an appropriate subject without being confused with other languages.
Where is his family?
Magdalena and Vania are good friends.
I’m happy and content.
We need to eat together during the day.
Consider one example.
Do you have a brother?
We got together.
I agree.
I have to think.
Where is Mary?
I was devastated.
I have to finish.
I’m glad you are there.
Do you think you are happy?
Why are you not with me?
He is not at home.
That is what I have said.
She fell in love with him.
She is not pregnant.
Why did they like me?
How Much Should I Donate?
What did you give me?
Go outside.
Tom is a carpenter.
I am not rich.
His face is intense; the brow is furrowed in concentration.
Not for Me.
How quickly you can stop that pattern!
I will be a part of them.
How many nights?
Yes.
I was introduced by greeting.
You have to go home.
Asa and his Father.
Send me. ’
Do you know where he lives?
I was unhappy.
Why don’t you go with me?
Give me your time.
Do you have my money?
This garden is a pleasing and good place.
I wish you had returned home.
I don’t have a brother.
I don’t know.
I don’t know my names.
Can You Do the Same?
I guess I did.
Do you know these people?
Which ones?
Why do I do it?
I’m not sure.
This industry operates automation.
I’m not a student.
That makes sense.
Do not do that again.
Position in window.
I was unhappy.
One fold is missing.
Get money.
He is happy.
We are running in the car.
Would you like to know why?
Would you like to find them?
Remember your kindness, and remember it.
I am the youngest.
What do you think this is?
We wanted talks in the language of the day.
So why have you come here?
I’m not sure.
I went to school.
He did not say a word.
We are born.
It’s too hot.
So I did that.
“ I have to learn.
Thank you so much!
Not really.
Does that make you happy?
You're ours.
What was that purpose?
I no longer have any visitors.
We are university students.
There is nothing new.
Come or come?
Can you enlarge on that?
Not everyone saw something.
I’ll try.
What are you doing?
I know the girl.
What kind of books do you like to read?
He needs water.
Where have they taken you?
That’s OK.
It makes me happy.
How many cups of coffee have you drank?
What is this gathering?
This vehicle is very beautiful.
Yes.
Our legs are weak.
Yes.
Your background?
I know you do.
I would like that.
Children.
He is a teacher.
We headed for the lowlands.
I don’t know any of the names I remember.
Do you want to become rich?
I would like to read this book.
Give me a chance.
I am a university student.
These provisions are available to us.
They do not want to know.
It’s not my car.
You mark the sign of the red light.
I know what I’m told to learn.
I miss you very much.
What you say.
I want you to come home.
We go together.
Give a chance.
I am not strong in that I am not.
No one!
It is not something to be proud of.
Do you understand French?
It’s so hard to think.
Early on.
How large is this wine?
I have my brother.
They are few in number.
You call when you need help.
So do I.
We got off the bus.
Here they are not wealthy.
What is his goal in life?
Listen to your mother!
I love mathematics.
He is here!
We go there together.
The next week.
I’ve always liked your recipe.
What do you do?
That’s what I’m doing.
Come?
You know that we love you.
You can separate the sheep from the goats.
I’ll have to think about that.
She listens.
I love to learn French.
It is as if we can go ashore at this end of the week.
Why?
You are not coming, are you?
You have to go home.
How old is he?
I did not know.
I Will Not Forget It
It seems unlikely.
I know where to turn.
Unless that rain falls, he goes to work.
Thank you so much!
I do not want to give up.
What is going on in the lower?
I’ll see a game.
It sounds so good.
I’m reading a book.
Do you know who the car is?
That’s what I’m doing.
You are a good student.
Remember that.
I am sure that I was able to see him again.
Do you have a deadline?
I love short hair.
Are you planning to attend the meeting?
The shower is too big for me.
Disorientation.
Give it up.
How quickly you can stop that pattern!
Why do you feel that way?
I have my sisters.
He passed through his turn of wood.
Come with you?
He does not love us.
Not at all!
It is not good.
Recently, I joined a French - speaking group.
It will be very good.
I swore.
Path.
Everything is so rewarding.
I had a full morning of activity.
It gives us much joy.
Let us buy it.
I’m not a good person.
I know what I’ll do.
What would you like to know?
We know why you came here.
My grandmother spoke slowly.
I’ll try.
I love to learn French.
She is pregnant.
I wouldn’t have come.
What do you think this is?
Can I open the door?
That was a day!
I know what to do.
I am a university student.
Listen.
Where is my money?
I see you.
Are you at home?
I know who you are.
I want to talk to you.
I enjoy what I see.
I know what you think.
It depends on you.
I am learning French at home.
Your sister?
We are born.
They do not come today.
Schooling — Is It for Children?
What do you want?
Where do you stand?
She doesn’t give me any explanations.
I do not give up.
Do not be that way.
Get money.
Why me?
I’ll be back.
I wish I had let you go.
Take us!
The word comes from Greek.
The bus stops but is not finished.
Do you love him?
The road is full of huge potholes.
I read her lips.
Speak for them in French.
Dogs often wake up in bones.
A glass filled to the point or renting to the center?
Do not be that way.
I’m the surgeon in the operating room.
We returned many times to the extreme.
Where do you know him?
Where do you want to go?
I have to quit.
We need not guess.
He is a good man.
I’ll be happy with you.
I want to see you again.
Discipline!
I want to see you.
Don’t you expect it?
You are my friend.
We listen.
Why at home?
Here are your opportunities to do this?
These flowers are known as roses.
You are not cramped for room within them.
We might take them.
You know that I love you.
We prepare rice this way.
You are not our brother.
It will not come, is it?
They came to the house.
I’m glad you are there.
I can do that.
You used to smoke cigarettes, don’t you?
You can find any color that makes you happy.
It doesn’t matter.
What is the error?
You are a good cook.
Whose fault is this?
Do you know what he said?
I was in a state of shock.
Would you like to know?
Prices go up.
My left hand was an enormous muscle.
This is mine.
Smoking kills your health.
My father’s car is a new one.
I said nothing.
I can’t believe it.
Tell me, if you do know understanding.
You need a goal.
You stop me.
Do you want to quit?
I love my family.
I don’t want to be here.
You are young ones.
I need time to think.
This car is my car.
Close the window!
I don’t understand French.
Remember to deliver a letter.
I’m curious about that.
It makes you happy.
I knew it was fun.
That’s frustrating!
I knew it.
Is that what you want?
I loved you.
I don’t know your name.
I'll take a break.
Watch your head.
He has hundreds of books.
Do not listen to him.
Darkness belongs to me.
What do you do?
We want him to be his perfect companion.
I still feel the pain of the loss.
The book has no invitation.
I don’t want to see you.
He is a good student.
You do not have to write a long letter.
I wish I had let you go.
You are a good student.
Which sandals?
These are conditions that are at risk of death.
They were happy.
Do you want to log in?
He loves her.
Where is your father?
Do not read again.
I know you’re listening.
No one knows his name.
I will drive the car.
You are not my brother.
Work in a factory.
That is what I have said.
Look ahead!
He always had his free will.
Get here.
Of no benefit!
I knew him.
Close the window.
The factory will begin working next year.
Prices ran high.
This year I plan to read as many books as possible.
I don’t feel quite so well.
We are born.
The hand has five fingers: the arm, the rod, the insect, the weighing of all the scales, the thumb, the big toes, the big toes.
I have found your father.
What are you reading?
He is not at home.
Where is my car?
At first, the bed was often closed.
Do you have a car?
Why do they say that?
I don’t know how to cook.
Keep cool and calm.
How do you feel about the fifth Friday?
I’m glad you are there.
Not really.
"Let these trucks be popular?" – "It is the Father's."
I know what I’ll do.
No, he was not.
Let her own breasts intoxicate you at all!
Whose side is he on?
I ask him to write me a list.
I do not want to know.
Keep a letter in mind.
If he had, you would have preferred the time.
A man who wants to take his wife is able to communicate well with his father.
He listens.
You seem to know.
They are so beautiful that they dominate the world.
What is the family like?
You want to see it.
We arrived.
Whose Bible Reading Will You Read?
Why do people hate me?
I spent a lot of time learning the guitar.
Not necessarily.
I’m sorry I threw you out of the hole.
I was hungry.
You’re right.
Why not?
Why do you have something?
Where is the automobile?
Now I have to go.
My car died.
We are at home.
We are happy to see them.
How does your father feel?
I love mathematics.
He does not attack.
He will likely come tomorrow.
I ran.
My house is near the temple.
I know how to use them.
Here is where I do.
Let me see.
She left the key of her car.
Are you a new student?
It makes me feel sick.
Why do we do this?
May I, please, insult you.
I don’t have a car.
You are not coming, are you?
He is happy.
Because you are in control of my life.
Do You Recall?
Do Not Look!
Each one knew what was expected of him.
I thought about it.
What did I do?
Because you are in the middle of the tragedy.
I want you to know that.
I can count on the benefits I have received.
I do not like studying.
No one can be certain.
They want us to do so.
Are you here?
Close all windows.
I want to go home.
I had a full morning of activity.
I threw away my glasses.
Some of the workers did not have the experience.
What are you doing here?
They were not happy.
Crazy?
Fill a need.
Would you like to know why?
Asa and his brother.
I listen to you.
Why are you not with me?
I don’t want your money.
It is a day!
I know what needs to be done.
My throat closed up.
I have schoolwork.
I knew you would be there.
Do not give up!
Let me buy bread.
My daughter is quite young.
I know.
January is the first month of the year.
I arrived about four o’clock.
I need to know.
Frog is a reptile.
We meet there.
Do not listen.
I want to be with you.
Languages shape the way they use it.
In the past, there were churches here.
We miss you too.
Who do you think I am?
Why don’t you want to go?
Want to know what happened?
Why do you feel that way?
Why not try this match?
My sister is like Mom.
You can move there.
I want to see you.
I don’t respect it.
Why not?
Do you have a sibling?
He is not a baby.
I don’t have any books to read.
We’re always playing with God’s day.
Always wash my dot and my hands.
Which house is this?
Why are you not in school?
I think it’s OK.
I don’t know the size.
I was full of rage.
We are learning French.
I want to see you.
How much time do you want to spend on it?
Asa and his Father.
No one knows his name.
The window is closed.
Do not lose your way back.
It is a remarkable book.
This book is a masterpiece.
Stay out of bed!
The bed is well - designed.
I’m not sure.
Concentrate on it, Timmy.
We listen.
You have to stop drinking.
Talk to me.
I couldn’t look.
He nodded.
I don’t know.
He acquired the most expensive garment he could possibly have.
All I know is his name.
Asa and your brother.
Let me explain.
They are not yours.
I’ve found it.
Is it all right for the trips?
I think they’re perfect.
I am not stupid.
I am here for you alone.
The student wants to see you.
Shall I wear a rag or a rag?
I am a university student.
Gradually, the child’s abilities are revealed.
The dampness is good.
I will not quit.
I have heard about staying a few days in your home.
I am a university student.
We follow the west.
I heard it’s OK to make fun of you.
What about your home?
I’m always on the receiving end of the day.
Does your room have two windows?
I have been serving in this department since last year.
They are extremely tall.
I’ll understand.
Why do you have this?
He did not read the book.
You are in Norway today.
All day long it was God’s day.
Where is your brother?
I came to learn.
I cannot wash the dirty dishes that have accumulated.
I am on vacation.
Does he or she know that you love him?
I am a loaf of bread.
It’s my new car.
Get out of the car.
See how I do this!
I’m in the kitchen.
It’s wonderful to know your name.
Do you love it?
I know what is happening.
In the center of the fire.
Do not be deceived!
We don’t have any money.
What is the family like?
Where?
I love what I do.
We don’t have a car.
Do not say again.
I will make you happy.
I love to be here.
How are you doing?
He has a car.
Remember your kindness, and remember it.
Do not let me do this.
I have to see you.
Avoid owning money.
I know what they are doing.
Do you know what it is?
I’m glad you are there.
Your dinner is secure.
You are like children.
They are not interested in you.
The bus station is about five minutes from here.
I don’t think I’m up to that.
You are a good cook.
Let me devour you.
What Do You Want?
Why did you leave me?
What is my schedule?
For refreshments.
I saw him running.
A good question.
I love to read.
This girl is dating like a boy.
I love you.
He acquired the most expensive garment he could possibly have.
Get your shoes off.
We do not know.
He loves her.
He is a good man.
It makes me happy.
Where is Mary?
Why ask me?
It is a noble purpose.
It’s shameful.
It seems unlikely.
Forgive me so much!
Do you?
You are my friend.
What kind of books do you like to read?
He is not a baby.
Why do you want to move?
I wish you had returned home.
A factory that works for thousands of bottles is within the month.
It’s hot here.
I don’t know them.
You will fall in love with him.
It will not come, is it?
I clean windows.
Why do I have to go?
Good morning, I’ll take it back.
I know it will make you happy.
Let me tell you a new one.
Be quiet!
Ur's freeness.
Too Big?
He loves her.
He enjoys reading books.
Why don’t you go in?
I don’t know how long they will continue.
Do you not know what it is?
Why don’t you go with me?
Why do you ask?
Think about what you want.
You will win.
He does not speak English.
A car breaks down.
This wall is cool.
Why do you feel that way?
No one knows their names.
Find out.
Where is your father?
I’ll go to bed.
Could I use it?
Too Long?
Did you notice their eyes?
The carpenter?
The payment is, not monthly, but daily.
Come, you too?
I am a Chinese woman.
The owner of the car is my father.
Thank you!
Asa and his mother.
We know him.
Flowers and trees need fresh air and fresh water.
I too am going to school.
I am coming to you.
The next morning was a fifth.
He is he!
We don’t understand French.
We do not want to know.
I have money for you.
I have stomach problems.
Do not do that again.
I understand what you say.
I understand why you would like to be like that.
I think he will come.
Is that true of you?
See how beautiful it is.
No, you thank him.
What do you think?
He is not a baby.
He knows exactly where we are.
Probably not.
It is ours.
He does not love us.
It will be very good.
She is a Frenchman.
You received a red sign.
Would you like me to come?
I knew you were here.
Stop reading.
He is described as very wealthy.
I am sure that I have ever seen her.
What about today?
Your skin is bitter, and I don’t even think you have a cold day.
She draws near to him.
Are you a student?
A good night!
I don’t know where they are.
Why So Long?
I think I was sitting on it.
You seem to know.
My house is next to the church.
I’m not my sister.
We are not obliged to speak to one another at a time.
I know.
I don’t want this money.
Where is the sower?
You can stay home.
Bring two bulls.
This new car is quite a new one.
When Do You Study?
The windows touched south.
Do not give up!
So do I.
Why Not Go to School?
What is this phone?
What is this phone?
We know.
My father is at home.
I don’t know what you want.
He receives one.
Where is his family?
What was the difference?
I am on vacation.
If you are sick, you need to rest.
Money spent on me.
Levels look like yellow.
Nobody else was there except me.
I said that it made me feel bad.
I know what I say.
I think you can learn that.
Last week, my friend caught up with me.
I go home.
I’ll take it.
We shall return to the start.
She fell in love with him.
Where is your brother?
It will not come, is it?
If he had stayed at home, no problem would have arisen.
Don’t look nice.
Did it bring you here?
You will fall in love with him.
I saw him.
That’s what I’m looking for.
Yes!
I am not good enough.
I clean windows.
I don’t think so.
My father was not at home.
Do not give up!
Do you?
No, he was not.
The boy wins.
The class is over.
If I do, I will try again.
The money ran out.
We are university students.
I haven’t.
I need to get some rest.
I think so.
I’ve found it.
I grabbed hold of him.
Why So Much Hate?
I read this book.
I am coming to you.
I don’t think I’m up to that.
Do You Know What to Do?
Give him a copy.
You are beautiful, O girl companion of mine.
I don’t think I’m up to that.
Get rid of your shoes.
I know he loves me.
You are not my brother.
I shall see.
This day is God’s day.
I know.
He is crooked.
This garden is a pleasing and good place.
What a home!
We’ll survive.
You see, this is my home.
Why not?
I will grant your request.
They are extremely tall.
Let me see.
Thank you very much.
I need time to think.
I know you will be happy with you.
It is a book that I have.
What are you reading?
I speak three languages.
Where are you?
I struck with a knife to the finger.
We do not know.
Do not come back.
What do you know?
Can we start now?
He does not love us.
He enjoys reading books.
Be realistic.
I don’t need it.
Is there a washing machine in your home?
May God bless you!
I know where you live.
How long will you stay there?
Now look at the picture.
What do you think?
I love mathematics.
My neighbor is a carpenter.
Many trees fell.
Do you?
Be on your own!
You need not wonder!
I do.
True.
Be young.
When she saw the blood supply, she looked around.
Do you know what they want?
What would you like to see?
I’ll let you have a copy.
Where is he playing?
I love you too.
Otherwise, when?
I don’t know where you are.
Why not?
Opening the window.
Do not forget to ask further questions.
It is an hour nine minutes away.
We parted.
I know you’re listening.
That is why I love you.
What do you know about what happened?
They will know how to do this.
Eventually, we were alone.
Do you know where?
We know.
I know how to get there.
What has your car become?
All night long it is a ligaments.
This book is a new one.
There is no water in the cup anymore.
I sell clothes in line.
It’s too hot, is it?
I know what needs to be done.
He is he!
I thought.
Do you remember this game?
He is happy.
We don’t have any money.
I don’t know what I want.
Thank you!
This day is three.
Do you know?
Ask him what his name is.
They do not want to be used.
My dream had come true.
By whom?
I know you’re listening.
Track your progress as you complete each step.
Keep a letter in mind.
She hears French.
I came to love him.
Please read on.
I am not a university student.
It’s too cold.
I listen to you.
I think I have the chance of the cup of coffee.
We love our park.
Why do you love me?
Don’t be there.
I would like you to read them.
Clarify where you are going.
I think you can learn that.
I don’t respect it.
The word comes from Greek.
The owner of the property is my brother.
Why do I have to do it?
Why not?
You’re dead?
I know what needs to be done.
Keep a letter in mind.
You do not want to know!
I know your mother.
The word is cruel.
I am free to do whatever I want.
Array.
I want answers.
Where is my money?
Why do you ask them?
You have something inside that you want to get rid of.
Thank you very much.
This girl is dating like a boy.
I came looking for you.
For the days of God I shall be in the house of my father.
Do good to those hating you.
The word comes from Greek.
What was the difference?
Do not count the number.
My name is John.
Do you see the point?
I have brothers and sisters.
Do you know who the car is?
I will not give up.
But he is learning.
Would you like to paint a picture of your nails?
It is Saturday.
I need three volunteer workers.
He ran out of money.
The financial statements.
We do not know.
Do not give up.
You can learn English.
Leave my room!
I understand.
It is ordered to stop.
My father loves me.
I don’t want to be rich.
I have money.
My skull was fractured.
What Is Alcohol?
I know these people.
I don’t have a place to live.
We parted.
They do not come today.
What do you want for us?
What?
Recently, I joined a French - speaking group.
How does your sister feel?
I do not want to get sick.
He is grateful for his new bicycle.
Is goodness more appealing to humans than goodness?
Can you not recognize this?
I said nothing.
