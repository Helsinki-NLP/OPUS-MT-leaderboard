Members of the Welsh convention are concerned that they appear to be stupid
There are the AMs concerned because they are being raised to be MWPs (Legalment of Wales).
This has been done because programs have changed the name of the convention into a Welsh Parliament.
The Ams in all politics are concerned that this will cause them to be bathed.
One AM of Labour says that his group is concerned that the pronunciation of this new name is near the way it is called "Twp" and "Pwp."
For a student who does not live in Wales: Welsh tap means a foolish man, and pwp means a cat.
The AM of Wales has said that the whole organisation is not interested in this, and has suggested other names.
A former Conservative member in Wales says that his group has no problem with the change of name, but he has seen that it would be easier to call MWP in the way you call a fool.
In this case the form of the letter w is the same as the English letteru.
The Assembly Commission, concerned with setting up a policy on changing the name to this new name, said: "The decision of how to call the Members of the Assembly will be taken by the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly permission to change its name.
In June, the Commission issued a public response and found that the majority supported the change of the convention as the Welsh Parliament.
At the Ms, the Commission prefers the Members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMPs, but people support the MWP.
The AMs is said to offer some alternative advice, but that it is difficult to agree on the subject must be the problem with Elin Jones, the Executive Officer, who is expected to make changes in the coming weeks.
This policy of change will include other changes to the function of the assembly, including the rules to stop the AMs and the structure of the committee.
An AMs vote that will be read at the end of a rule on the question of how to be called.
Macedonians will choose to change the name of their country
The votes will vote on Sunday even to change the name of their country into the "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The vote is made to resolve a centuries - long conflict with neighboring Greece, which is the province of Macedonia.
The Athenians once claimed that the name of their neighbors in the north made them feel hostile in their community, and they have long been against their claim to be members of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjoge Ivanov, who is opposed to the change of the name vote, said he was not in favor of the vote.
However, supporters of the vote, including Prince Zan Zaev, say that this change of name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin Beated as Churches in Harlem
Mr. Adams said: "The old people I spoke to said that there had always been a bar and a church everywhere."
"Today, none of them."
You understand why barley did not exist.
He said: "People are having a different sense of humor ” these days.
"Bari is no longer the living areas of the neighborhood where people go regularly."
You are concerned about the churches because you think the money they have received from selling their goods will not last as long as the leaders think, "and they will soon return to their original position."
In addition, the churches may be replaced by empty huts that can no longer help to retain what is left of the local holy places.
He said: "Most people who buy these labels are white people; therefore the day will soon come when the churches are closed, because they don't seem to be members of these churches.
Both churches were white churches before Harlem became black areas, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, in St. Martin a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregation appeared in the 1930 ’ s.
The black congregation that he was serving in nearby became the very one that was built.
St. Martin became a black congregation under the Death. John Howard Johnson, who led a merchant exchange to 125th Street, the best street to be purchased at Harlem, which was opposed to unemployment and lack of support from black people.
In 1939 this building was badly damaged by fire, but as the followers of Tat' Johnson prepared to rebuild it, it was ordered to be struck with irons.
Hu. David Johnson, son and successor of Tat' Johnson in St. Martins, enthusiastically called the strike of iron as "throbbers's bells.
An expert in metal drilling, who had struck them, called it another way: “Technology" or "a historical instrument which will never be replaced."
This scholar, Tiffany Nq, of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first time in the world if the metal instrument was played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the Richlded Church with a lot of bells 18 years ago.
Mr. Merlyweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
The main feature here in St. Martin's in the past few months has been the work of draft artists and builders, some of whom have been introduced by non-teacher church leaders, others by the Presbyterian church.
A congregation - governing body, made up of nonteacher leaders, wrote to the crowd in July, concerned that a mob would not be responsible for the congregation, even though it did not contribute to the hire of architects and tunnelers.
Some members complained that the cane does not count things.
A shark injures a 13-year-year child drowning in obtaining lobsters in California
The officers said, the shark has attacked and wounded 13 boy on Saturday, when he was immersed to catch a lobster in California on the day of the opening of a lobster year.
This attack took place just before 7 o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Echritas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB- TV in San Diego that he was swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help. Then they went swimming to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said, at first I thought it was a pleasure to hold a lobsterster, but later "he realized that he was shouting, ‘ I’m bitten! ’
‘ I'm forgiven!'
This bone is below the throat over the breast of the whole breast, "Hammel noticed this when he got to the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy is airborne to the Lady Children's Hospital in San Diego where they are in critical condition.
It is not known which species of shark remains.
Kapt. Larry Giles says that when talking about matters, a shark has been seen there in the past weeks, but it has not been a dangerous form of shark.
Giles adds that the victim has been seriously injured by the body above.
The officers have closed the sea from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Cannitas for 48 hours to search to ensure safety.
Giles says there are more than 1535 sharks in the area, but most of them are said to be harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to move its product to the UK configuration market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debeenhams for stores that have makeup and professional people to help.
As an important way to enter the UK's cosmetics market for £2.8bn, which continues to grow while fashion and household sales are down, these large hallways will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country, and will be available in more stores the next year to run well.
The investment in cosmetics is due to the use of empty shelves after charges on TV, microwaves and household.
Sainsbury's will increase the products you have twice as many as 3,000, including such names as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. Paw Paw.
Older ones, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and But's Bees, will have more room to place them in places with names like their names in stores like Boots.
The store will also inform the Boutian's designer products so that many are ready for non-saturated people - something that new buyers desperately need.
Also, the fun-mug broker Fragrance Shop will test the requirements for two stores in Sainsbury's, first opened at Croydon, south of London, this past week, and the second will be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the course of the year.
Buying on the Internet even though people now buy very little food a day at a nearby store, this requires that large stores do more to encourage people to go there.
Mike Coupe, director of the Sainsbury's chief executive, said that these stores will look like big stores with various products, as they are trying to fight expensive multimills, such as Aldi and Lddud, for more services and other non-food products.
Sainsbury's puts the stores where you can buy Argos in many stores and starts with Habits because they have bought them both over the past two years. This has increased the purchase of food and earned them.
Efforts at this early market to improve cosmetics and medical facilities have failed.
Her Sainsbury's attempt to contact Boots in the early 2000s, but they split up after fighting in a way that would separate the market profits from its stores.
This new plan is made after the Sainsbury's sells Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, its 281 drug - store business by £125m, three years ago.
It states that Lloyds will also participate in this scheme, by increasing the high-smoker products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy at four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of trade at Sainsbury's, who said: "We have changed the appearance of the passage with our makeup to improve our customers.
We have invested in specially trained and professional employers to be able to give advice.
The different products we have are designed to be suitable for each item, which makes it look for where it is readily available, is now an interesting place of makeup and is not exactly the same as the old method.
Peter Jones's anger is' because Holly Willoughby has stopped the business £11million
Peter Jones noted in Dragos Den goes ‘ furious ’ after the system driver Holly Willoughby stopped the £11million industry of the life - style product so that he can deal with the new agreed-to-laws and the Marchs and Spencer and TV.
Willoughby has no time for their products of household and decorations such as Truly.
The business of this couple was likened to the Gwynth Pack's Goop product.
The driver of the Teaching Morning program, who has 37, has installed it in the Instaggram that he is moving.
Holly Willoughby left the famous Dragons" Den, Peter Jones in anger because he left the last minute of the life- style product factory - to monitor his new links with Marks & Spencer and TV.
The sources say that Jones was “infuriated" when the important young woman on TV admitted to a hot Tuesday conference at her capital of Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - reaching £1.5 million - makes her not enough time to pay attention to household products and decorations such as Truly.
This industry is compared to the Gwynth Pack's Goop product and had earned twice as much money as Willoughby's estimated £11 million.
As Willoughby, 377, was putting in the Instaggram if you left Truly, Jones went to one of his vacation homes in Britain.
The source said: "Truly has been the most important thing for Holly.
It is called her lateness for a long time over the next decade.
The decision to leave her alone is a personal one.
Nobody believed what was happening on Tuesday, just prior to the celebration of the celebration.
There is a store filled with the Marrow HQ items ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the Third Morning representative, among the rich in Britain, would cost the company millions of dollars because of overcultivable investment from the pillows and candles to the furniture and household items, and things that could delay its development.
And this can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s three mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
'Willoroughby founded Truly with Carpp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two go together on vacation and Jones has 40 percent of his own television company Baldwin's.
Willoughby will be the agent of this M&S epidemic and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as conductor of the TV program I'm A Celebrity.
The source near Jones once said "We will not talk about his business."
We said, ‘ We just love each other'
He has joked about criticism by the press by saying what some consider to be "disrespectful" and speaking well of a North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a sacrifice?
Trump said with his obscenities of “the media on the subject."
"I don't give up on myself.
He noted that Kim’s interest was that they would meet again after the first contact in Singapore in June with the Trumps as a major step toward the Nuclear War in North Korea.
But the Nuclear Non - Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty has ended.
More than three months after the June Council conference in Singapore, North Korea’s senior officer, R Yong Ho, told world leaders of the United Nations on Saturday of the World House of Peace the Act that the North does not see "an answer" from the United States to North Korea with anti-arming movements.
Rather, he said that the United States continues its focus on suppressing it.
Trump has given hope to the talk that he gave her at his wedding.
"We are doing well with North Korea," he said.
"We're against North Korea."
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we are very close to one another.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim and with good results resulted in the testing of submarines, which, in turn, released the victims and returned American bones.
And he has defended his unusual approach to the conversation with Kim.
"It is very easy to become presidents, rather than 10,000 people on the outside trying to enter this crowded stadium we would have about 200 people standing here," Trump pointed to the crowd standing in front of him.
The Tsunami of Indonesia, and Jachma, destroy the Isle, killing hundreds of people.
After an earthquake in Lombok, for example, nongovernmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Even though 10 percent of the Lomboks had been removed from the area, the site did not appear to be a disaster spot, resulting in a world relief.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they make it clear that they are not asking to be helped by the world, so this is a challenge," Mrszn Sumung said.
While Save the Children includes a group to Palu, it is still not sure whether foreign workers can work there.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster center, said that Indonesian officials are studying the situation in Palu to see if the world agencies will be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Because of the constant quake in Indonesia, the country is not always ready for an earthquake.
While tsunamis are being built in Aceh, some beaches are not uncommon.
The absence of a tsunami in Palu, despite warnings, may have contributed to the death of humans.
Even during quiet periods, traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make travel more difficult.
A hospital ship came out of Lombok to treat quake victims to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Seddo laid the groundwork for improving the foundations of Indonesia’s deteriorating development in the development of elections, and he has spent a lot of money repairing railways and railway rails.
But lack of financial support has cost Mr.
Meanwhile, Mr. Joko is faced with the pressure of mixed sects in Indonesia, where many Muslim members have been involved in the most serious field of this service.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim bands fought on the streets with clubs, spears, and bayonets, as well as other dangerous weapons.

The police have urged residents who have seen or heard anything before.
The detective Brian O'Han said: ‘ The search is still beginning, but I am urging anyone in the John Street area at Birkenhead who has seen or has done anything that requires him to contact us.
I also would like to urge anyone, especially the detectives, who might take a photograph of anything about dashcam to contact us as possible.'

Cromwell’s statue is the last one to be found by the conflict of ‘ rewritten history. ’
The removal will be just the justice of the context because of his destruction like that of Tabavan in the many traditional and religious pictures of his zealous Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell described the advice of Mr Crick as "foolishness" and " attempted to write history again."
... John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It would have been inevitable that in this discussion it is possible that the removal of images of Oliver Cromwell's statue outside the Palace of Westminster would be a target.
The destruction of images in English wars was not ordered or made by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell will be handed over for the actions of his great - grandfather Thomas of the first century.
The outstanding way in which Sir William Hamo Thornycft described Cromwell is the testimony of the 19th century and part of the history of many who still think his life should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told you The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more often towards the end of the 19th century than at present, as a representative of the parliament against external pressure, largely in his case from the empire.
Whether this description is correct depends to a discussion of the ongoing historical controversy.
To be sure, the strife that existed in the mid-17th century has influenced the development of our next country, and Cromwell has been one who has taken a stand on the same side in the conflict.
What they accomplish as the Lord the Protector must be celebrated and remembered.
The Deadly Eagle Attacked a Chinese Farmer and Killed
A farmer has been attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
A man, described only by his figure "Yuan," was found wanting with a broken bone, is covered with blood near a pig in the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post, to report on the Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to milk his pigs in the hags area on May 30, 2005, in Xining Province in Quinghai, China.
He was said to be accompanied by his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he found that the door to the nearby hoarkey is open.
There, he says, was a big bull that had blood in his mouth.
Florquet studies confirmed that the 250-pounders were wounded and killed the mother, according to the report.
"The father's legs were blooded and twisted," said the cousin named "Wu," as quoted by Guiginging Evening News.
Security cameras showed Yuan entry to the market in 440 am on Thursday for feeding pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig killed Yuan neither his own nor his cousin.
The manager of the shopping mall told Eve News that the pig had been locked up to prevent further attacks, while the police had gathered a witness in the poor area.
the Yuan family and the local authorities are said to talk about the compensation he receives for his death.
Although rare, it is the situation in which pigs will record their first attacks on humans.
In 2016, the pigs attacked a young man and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, a man who was seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 600-weight pig caught a Welsh farmer from a tractor until his wife drove the pig away.
After a Oregon farmer had eaten by his pigs in 2012, one of Manitoba farmers told the CBC News that the pigs did not seem to be aggressive but their blood consumption could cause them to be so.
Make fun of them.
They are nailed, tightly guarded... with no intention of harming you.
You need to give you the right solution, you say.
The Hurricane RosaFregment brings light everywhere in heavy rain to the southwest of the U.S.
As a matter of weather forecasts, Herica Rosa loses her battle as she heads for the cool waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
Even so, Rosa will bring torrential rains to the northern and western regions of the U.S.

Rosa is expected to head west on Sunday.
In the meantime, the tough begins to take shape in the Pacific Sea and travels east along the western coast of the U.S.A., as Rosa helps Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will first push to absorb the depth of tropical and to the northwestern part of the U.S.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to Mexico’s areas on Monday.
Then, the relatively low troical humidity and the coming tidal flow will produce increased rainfall in the Southwest for the next few days.
At home, 1 / 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, the flow of the millmeters and the continents in the desert.
By refrigerating the extreme humidity of the troical will cause the rainfall to be 2 to 3 inches per hour per hour in the falls, particularly in the southern regions of Navajo and Arizona.
Although it is expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain in the South West areas, especially in the Arizona side.
The noise of flooded water is immediately apparent in conditions of tropical rainfall.
It would not be the best advice to try to walk through the desert in fear of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause cannons to become raging rivers and thunders will bring wind and dust to the neighborhood.
Its coming will bring some heavy rain in parts of the Southern California coast.

In some cases this affects significant changes in temperature over a short distance.
There is a good example of the different types of temperature in the U.S. Central summer.
It is about 20 degrees of temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Monies, Iowa.
During the past few days, the heat of summer tries to create and multiply.

More than 20 million people watch the attention of Kavanough Brett.
More than 20 million people have been watching the fourth-century evidence made by the High Court's election of Brett Kavanaugh and the alleged sexual abuse of her in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political state is still in progress, with a broadcast disrupting the routine of the fifth custom to change at the last minute: a contract made by the Sen of Arizona Jeff Flake to carry on a week’s investigation in the case.
Ford told the Sante Executive Committee to confirm 100 percent that Kananough had put her finger under the influence of alcohol and had tried to free her from a high school party.
Kavanough, in body evidence, said he was 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
It is normal to have been more than 20.4 million people who had seen the report by Nelson on Friday.
The company counted the size of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC issues.
The numbers were not available at this time to be visible on other networks, including PCS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And nielsen has the desperate task of comparing people who have seen it in office.
To put it this way, the size of the followers is similar even when the finish line in a soccer game or the Study Activities.
The Fox Channel of the News, in his view of having a program that supports the election of Kavanough with power, leads all the other network by having followers at the rate of 5.69 million per day, says Nielsen.
ABC was in the second position with 3.26 million observers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, the MSNBC was 2.89 million and CN had 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest remains high after the admonition.
Flake was the main character in the fifth drama
After the central office of the Republic has issued a vote for Kavanough, the CNN and CBS Cameras were received on the fifth morning by the protesters as they tried to climb the screw to the administrative board of the Executive Committee.
You have been standing in shock for several minutes as he criticized, speaking for the moment on CNN TV.
"I stand here before you," said the speaker.
"Do you think that you mean the truth to the world?"
He was told, "You are strong when the majority of the participants are powerless."
Flake had his office set out the compartment and said that, before closing the fence, he would have much to say to the counseling committee.
with a broadcast network and all cables were distributed at this moment for the following hours, while the Executive Committee would vote to continue the election of Kavanough to the full election net.
But Flake says he will do so only by reasoning with the FBI where he will look at charges against election in the coming week, where the Democrats are the few groups in which they were advised.
Flake has advised this by speaking to a friend, The Democratic Admirator Chris Coos.
After talking with the Coons and the other satellites, Flake makes a decision.
Flake’s choice is powerful, for there is evidence that the Republicans do not vote in favor of Kavanauh without investigation.
President Trump has opened the FBI research for investigations of charges against Kavanauough.

I have seen my parents cry with tears of joy because they were able to vote, but now we cannot continue, ’ you say.
Unless they are able to control the extensive election of the provinces during the last December, the P-inderence groups of Catalan have had difficulty keeping that situation in this year because their best-known leaders have kept themselves in the detention or under the police station awaiting trial for the roles they played in the wake of the integrity of the ransom and following the successful proclamation of freedom.
Joan Puig, an 42-year-old builder who has recorded the protest against the police on his phone, has had a conflict influenced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting worse.
On Saturday, Orol Junqueeras, one of nine Catalan leaders in the front of a prison trial last year, announced that he would participate in the election of the Europa Parliament next year.
"If you represent the choice in the European election, it is the best way to criticize the furthering of the free-guilability and control we have seen from the Spanish government," says.

Menga installed an article given to Livingston 1-0 and then succeeded in Ranges
First article of Dolly Menga and Victory in Livingston
The extension of Livingston surprised Rangers by forwarding Steven Gerrad just twice to the 18th games to be made the head of the Ibrix clubs.
The attack player Dolly Menga has confirmed the difference as the Gary Holt's side has increased levels with Hiberian in a second.
The Gerrard's side is already unable to succeed in the Premiership games on this ax and facing the leaders of the Hearts, who drew them by eight points, on the next Sunday.
Earlier, Frangers had met Rapid Vienna in the European League of Europe by the Siine.
Livingston, at present, told of their failure level in the section to six games, where the principal instructor Holt was about to experience the victory since he replaced Kenny Miler in the past month.
Livingston has missed the opportunity for unauthorized visitors
The Holts should have led before they post the notes, in particular that causes the Rangers to have all types of problems.
Scott Robinson has demonstrated that he draws your efforts in line with the article, Alan Lithgow can point out his efforts to go back in
Restaurants have been thrilled to see Rangers play in front of them, knowing that it would be no problem for their favorite guests.
And that is how an important article comes about.
The Rangers have received free kick and Livingston worked and opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson met by setting Menga, who has touched the ball to put the score from the middle of the box.
By this stage, the Rangers were the most likely to hold the ball, but they discovered that the driver was firm and that the middle class Liam Kelly was not problem free.
The vehicle continued on and off, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on turning down Kelly’s ball.
Scott Pittman has been charged with the foot of Allan McGregor, a gang member of the Rangers and Lithgow who has thrown a ball from another Livingston player.
The cross balls have continued to come to the Livingston docks and have continued to be clarified, while there were two palpitations after the test by Halket's entry into Glen Middleton, one was the Handball-based.

Scotland’s BBC Lamont in Tony Macroni Arena
Working with the marvelous level and effects of Livingstone.
To the man. They were outstanding, they continued to admire them for all that was expected of the abandoned course ahead.
Their performance and control have not rarely changed since they returned from a standard aircraft, but the honor is given to Holt by the way he has played the team as soon as he has arrived.
He had many powerful men.
The gang leader Halket had a hull, which was running for the subbly-projecting of the insurance, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Worral at all times.
Rangers were in need of encouragement.
Although they have played well at times under the rule of Gerrad, they have fallen short of that level.
Their last ball was just a failure where they had set up a home-of-in-and-accumulated version of the Rangers, which has found them at the center of the table.
Erdogen received a mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blues on Saturday (29 September) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany assembled in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of the visit of President Erdogan that would be opposed in Germany to repair the relationship between NATO connections.
It is more than a matter involving human rights, the freedom of the newspapers and the convention of Turkey in the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a very large moque.
The city is home to most of the Turks again.
The police explained the reasons for safety to prevent 25,000 strong persons from meeting before themosque, but most of the supporters have moved nearby to see their president.
Hundreds do not go along with the Erdoganists-many of them are Kurdish-and make their words cut off, destroying the operation of the police and the decisions of the German government so that the national government will accept them.

Hurricane Rosa interrupts Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with high-water flooding (for drought areas it can benefit."
It is unlikely that troical pressure attacks Arizona, but that may occur right at the beginning of the next week as the Huricane Rosa continues to have the ability to travel through the South East Coast, which carries the risk of flooding with moving water.
The National Weather Service has already provided equipment to monitor flooding in Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and east of Navada, southwestern California and Utah, including the following cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, which will bring rain on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has written that only 10 tweets troical cylons have been stored in a tropical storm or at a pressure level for 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was not burricane within 40 miles of AZ.
The recent model of the National Hurricane Center estimated 2 to 4 inches of rain, with a single - to 6 inches in Arizona.
In some areas of the SouthWest Desert, including the center of the Rockies and the Great Basin, they are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, and ranges alone to 4 inches if possible.
In these floods the Rosa’s rain can be a blessing as it is ravaged by drought.
Although water travel is a very important factor, some rain is experienced because South West has a drought problem at the same time.
According to the U.S. DS, more than 40 percent of the droughts in Arizona have a much greater drought problem, the second highest rate of the moon.com
First, the Hurricane Rosa road leads to the Baja Peninsula in the California Peninsula of Mexico
The Rosa, still continues in the force of the churricacace morning by 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels up to 12 miles per hour.
The storm is taking in fresh water in the Pacific, and it soon loses its strength.
Even so, we are expected to make a land collapse in Mexico in the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon and evening on Mondays.
The heavy rain in Mexico may be a major factor, affecting the safe navigation risk.
"Deepness of rain is a total of 3 to 6 inches expected from Baja California to the western edge of Sonora, to the 10-inch possible, of ather.com has reported.
Rosa will then travel north to Mexico as a troical storm before reaching the Arizona board in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical pressure, which will thereafter go up to Arizona and south to Utah at midnight.
"The foremost danger expected for the Rosa or fregment is heavy rain in Baja, Caliphonia, northwestern Sanora, and U.S. Desert of the Southwest," said the Hurricane National Center.
These rains are expected to produce devastating torrential rains as well as dry riverbeds from desert rivers, channels from mountain land.

Hundreds in Indonesia are killed by an earthquake, the seemingly expanding Tsunami
At least 384 people were killed, many were swept away by the surf, where large earthquakes and tsunamis hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had assembled at the Palu's fifth-hu-to-riven quadrants in which the waves were up to 20 feet [6 m] high (18 feet] high in the dry ground, wiped out the people because they killed many people and destroyed anything in their path.
Tsunami follows a 7.5-substantial diameter.
"When the tsunami promised the appearance of yesterday, people were doing their duties at sea and they did not run away immediately and were the victims," Sutopo Puro Nucroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Executive of the BNPB Service, spoke as he gave a comment in Jakarta.
"The tsunami never traveled alone, to drag motors, blocks, houses, towing everything on the earth", says Nucroho, adding that the tsunami has gone through the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before it reaches the shore.
Some people climb trees because they try to avoid tsunamis and survive.
About 6,700 people have been discharged from their homes to 24 Pallu centers.
Aerial photoography was issued by the agency of emergency services that has already shown many buildings and stores damaged by tsunamis, munitions and fallen bridges and floodedmosques.
The tsunami has continued to move the city’s coastal waters on Saturday.
A number of earthquakes are confined to an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Ministry of Test of Technology (BPT) said that in its speech the largest quake was 200 times as strong as the nuclear explosion cast at Hiroshima in the Second World War.
Science is based on the City, which dwells at the end of the length, the bottom of the harbor, and may increase the size of the soup, so to speak.
Nugrono described the damage as "great" and has been described by thousands of houses, hospitals, stores, and hotels in a flood.
The bodies of some victims are trapped under a ladder of collapsed buildings, they are said to be 540 persons injured and 29 are still not seen.
Nugroho has said that the victims and damage may be as great as 200 miles [300 km]) to the North North Poles, in the area of Donggala, which is near the quake's epicenter.
The connection was completely paralyzed without details, from Dongga, and Negroho said.
More than 300,000 people lived there, said the Red Cross in their speech, added that their crews and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can be more," he said.
The Ministry on Saturday was criticized in the country in general for not taking advantage of the Palu tsunamis, although the officers had come with the waves during the release of the warning.
Photography characters have been given off through the press pages in which a man was on the top of a heard building to warn of despair when a tsunami reached people and the streets below.
Within minutes the water wall has hit the shore and taken the buildings and cars and threw them away.
Reuters photo was unable to move the picture at once.
The earthquake and tsunamis have caused great electric shocks to break up in the area of Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to carry out rescue missions.
Forces have begun sending transport vehicles and aid from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities have said, but those discharged leave their homes in desperate need of food and other necessities.
The city aircraft station has been reopened for only the purpose of serving together and will remain shut up until October.
Monamli Jonode was arranged for a visit to the resorts for those who had their homes destroyed in Palu.
The All Soars of Tsunami Indonesia are over 800.
Some old ones.
While the World Vision staff at Dongga were safe in the city of Palu, where the workers were housed in their offices ’ offices in Tarpaulin, they are past the most stressful events in their area, says Mr. Doba.
"They told me to see many houses destroyed," he said.
Too bad
And like rescue groups who begin to express strong feelings of trouble, some complain that some of the high - tech aid workers in other countries have been forbidden to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian policy, the support, support and employment of overseas workers can only begin to travel if a post-smoker is declared as a national disaster spot.
That's not yet done.
"It is a disaster in the province stage", says Aulia Arrian, spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"A president once said, "YYACH., this is a State disaster," we can open it to the State but still have no degree at present.
As it was the second night of the quake in Palu after the fifth of the quake and the tsunami, the relatives and relatives of the people still had the hope that friends and relatives would appear and that this miracle would leave an innocent story in the aftermath of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was released from the uniform.
The rescuers, in turn, rescued a woman who had been trapped in a coma for two days and found the mother’s body at her side.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor of the Indonesian national team of paragliding, trained the two paraglidings in this invisible group preparing Asia's games, which are scheduled at the beginning of this coming month in Indonesia.
Some of those imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandag, were his disciples.
"As a paraglidingfield, I have my feelings that are a burden to me," he said.
Mr. Gendon has again calculated the way, in the hours after the news of the hotel Roa and in the middle of people traveling on paragliding, who have been busy sending hhasapp messages to winers in Palu, and participants at the sea station.
His messages, though, are limited only to the gray character, instead of having two corresponding characteristics that indicate the reading of the message.
"I think this means the messages were not sent," he said.

Right West: Grapper has changed his personal name, Ye
Rapper musician Kane West has changed my name.
In discussing his conversion to name, he wrote to Twitter on Saturday, saying: "It was officially known as One West."
The West, 41, has been called the nickname Ye for a long time and has been using Moniker as the title of his eight-diferries, which has gone out of hand.
These changes occurred before they appeared in the Light Live on Saturday, where they were expected to turn over his new copy, Yandi.
You have entered the name of a musician Ariana Grande who has resigned for "for her reasons"", the songwriter said.2]
Since this is an official designation, West declared long ago that the name has a role in religious significance to him.
"I would believe that he've been the most common and widely used name in the Bible, which in the Bible means "one", West mentioned at the beginning of this year, when he was discussing the title of his tablet with DJ radio Big Boy. It is the host dog that was so well used in the Bible.
"As for you, I am the same, I say,
They present to Cain, that is, he alone, to He – because we are a reflection of our good things, our confusion, everything.
The disc is a reflection of what this is.
One of the most famous percentages of rappers has changed the name.
Sean Combs was known for its unique words, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he said that he chose to be named after them the so - called Land of Love.
A former singer with the West, JAY-Z, his name was also written in large letters with or absent bearings.
Mexico's AMLO promised that he would not serve the forces on the citizens.
President Andreas Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use civil defense forces as the country reaches the 50th anniversary of the injury and remuneration of the students.
Lopez Orrador has promised on Saturday at Trateolco Plaza that "he will never use festivals to oppress the Mexicans."
The armies began shooting in the prepackaged show on Oct. 2, 1968, killing more than 300 people during their Latin - American student organizations.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youths by giving them monthly support to their students as well as to open up a number of open universities to mankind.
He pointed out that unemployment and the failure of educational opportunities made young people join gangs.
The U.S. funded A.I.
China is becoming more active in non-compliance intelligence, the U.S. must double the time spent in research sections, say the client with the AI practitioner Kai- Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These compartments come after various U.S. government departments make announcements for AI, such as the U.S., which is limited to all legal AI methods.
In the meantime, China announced its plan this past year: it was aimed to be No.1 on the AI plan in 2030.
"Repetition of the AI laboratory will be a suitable starting point, as all other countries are later in the U.S., and look at the next design of the AI," says Lee.
Repeating cash support may multiply the chances of the next major AI success that will be done in the U.S., says Lee in interviews with the CNBCs this week.
Lee, author of the book "China, Silicon Valley, and New World Order" are published this month by Houghton Mifflin Hart, the CEO of the Convention Ventures, which supports one of the largest AI companies in China, the Facebook+.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, she worked on the AI program that struck the most prominent person of the American Othelllo pleyer, who was the manager of the Microsoft Research in the latter, and who was the president of Google in the China branch.
Lee has accepted the previous U.S. government technology competition as a Rocket for the Lototic Projects of High Security Research Projects and has asked when it will occur next, to determine the following wise ones.
U.S. researchers must work hard to win government funding, says Lee.
"It is not China to take the leadership of education; it is a joint entity," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technical firms hire qualified university personnel to work in AI in recent years.
Lee said that the change of foreign travel police would help to support its AI efforts
"I think the blue card will automatically be given to those who make PhD's on the AI," says.
The National Council of China released its Non-Negality Plan in the Next Generation in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation of the National Sciences provides financial support to students in similar educational institutions as do the Institute of Natural Science and other government institutions that contribute to U.S. researchers, but has a higher level of education than China, says Lee.
Early this year in the U.S. Department of Security established the Joint Information Center, which was designed for the joining parties from production to education, and the White House announced the establishment of the election of the Non-Authority Committee.
And this month the DARPA introduced $2 billion as the start of a test called the AI.
Since the NSF, it now has more than $100 million a year for research on the AI.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislation intended to create a National Security Commission in the Non-Neutral Intelligence has not yet begun these months.
Macedonians have switched to the retina to change the name of their country.
The Macedonians have switched to the hepherendu in Sunday to change the name of the country into the "Eddonian Northern Country," a movement that will settle the old dispute over the age of ten years with the ruins which members have called values in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, wants its neighbors to be in the North to represent its territory and close the entrance to NATO and the EU.
The two governments have made a treaty on June based on the request for a new name, but the National Socialists object to a change of the name that they say undermines the origin and culture of the majority of the Macedonians.
President Gjoge Ivanov said that he would not vote for referendum and the company that refused to cooperate are not sure that people who will vote will meet the requirements for 50 percent of the minimum required to carry out the approved referunum election.
The question on a refeminary election reads: "You may be a NATO member and a EU member who accepts an agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the word revolutions, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price paid is necessary to provide welcomes on such boards as the EU and the NATO of Macedonia, which are one of the countries to meet at the border of Yugoslavia.
"I came to this day to vote for the future of this country, making it possible for young people here in Macedonia to be able to live free under the protection of the European Union, for that would mean a safe life for all of us", says Olivera Georgijvska, 79 in Skopjeje.
Although not legally binding, members of parliament have said that they will commit themselves to the results of the vote so that they can be justified. 2]
A change of word will require a maximum of two to three parliaments.
The country’s election commission said there were no unusual reports on 1 p.m..
However, the people present stood 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election of 2016, where they were 6 % of the vote votes.
"I am here to vote for my children, our place in Eurpe," said Gjose Tanevski, who had 62, and who would be the candidate at the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and her son Dushko voted in Macedonia for a change in terms of the name which would open up the way to join the NATO and European Union in Strumica, Macedonia in September 30, 2018.
Before parliament at Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, of 54, repaired a small platform and dragged the chairs before the tent that were set up against the integrity.
"We are the NATO and the EU, but we want to join actively, not according to the services of the door" says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but are virtuous.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can convert such countries as China and Russia into a part of the Euro-Asian Connection.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO's membership will bring up the most desirable currency in Macedonia, where unemployment rates are more than 20 percent.
"I believe that many people will like that because more than 80 percent of the inhabitants who like Nato and EU," says Zave after vote on the ball.
He said that the "Yes" would be the result of "make sure of our future."
List of votes will be printed on the last Monday by the Macedonia Police Station, between 30 per cent and 43 percent of the votes to participate in the integrity- below the number required for the election to be successful.
One list of votes, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, was found 57 percent of the people who were prepared to vote on Sunday.
of these, 70 percent will vote for a "yes" one.
For the election to be effective, the integrity option must require 50 percent of the people and one person above.
The failure of the retina column will bring the first powerful blow to the pro-Western federal police since its taking of the cable in May this past year.

Scherzer wants to play on Spoleer vs. Rockies
when the Nationalals subdivision was formed in a conflict of platoffs, there was no reason to force re-starting.
But a former rival named Sherzer hopes to find a rise point on the Sun when he plays with the Colorado Rockies, but only when the results have been lost on Rockies's bats, and has the leadership level of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Cape.
The Rockies have completed a small bit of the wild-card post where they won 52 in the Nationals on Friday night, but they still look at their quote in the first section.
"Though we're not playing for anything, at least we'll be able to put the bomb on the rubber, who knows the nature of Denver and observers and other groups in any higher point I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I compete?
The Nationals have already announced their beginning with the Sunday, but they have reported an encouraging report to Scherzer in this case.
Szcherzer, who will begin in 34th class, make a bullen on Thursday and will be doing his normal rest on Sunday.

Trump trucks in West Virginia
The President points directly to the position of the person he has chosen in the High Court when he speaks about the importance of the discharge of the Republicans who will vote in medieval choice.
"All that we have done can be lost in November.
There are the remaining five weeks of a history - making campaign that is of great significance in our time.
This choice is large, large", "survivors," says, and I really don't run for this very much of the world in an effort to find the right kind of people to defend, I say.
Trump further said, "When you see the evils, the atrocities of the violent Democrats group, you see them occurring right now.
They are also determined to take over the authority of the government by using whatever means are appropriate, cruel, unfeeling attitude toward them.
They don't care who or who has hurt them, who will go over them, to gain power to control and control, and that's only what they need for power to control, we'll not give them this.
The Democrats, he said, are in machines on a mission to "result and interrupt."
"And you have seen what happened in the past four days," said, calling the Democrats "out of anger is cruelty and intolerance.
He refers to the Senate’s Senate Committee on the Level of Democratics Dianne Feinstein by name, where he has received greetings from onlookers.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you moved in?
Uh, h, what is it.
No, no, I'm waiting for one – it's bad to say about the body and talk about the body as bad as I haven't seen.
Labour is still a complex.
It is not easy for these speakers to express themselves
While the Momentum's distributives in my local group voted against me, it was surprising.
After all of this, I am the top one in the Labour class to be told what they all think.
A workmate named Joan Ryan received similar treatment from my house - to - house coworker Joan and had taken a firm stand as an opposer of the Jews.
In my case, the situation of criticism and opposition to me was my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
To the important police of the operating economic system, to the security of the country, Europe, by mugging similar issues where Jeremy disagrees with former leaders.
The notice of the meeting With Attingham East Labors wrote on Friday that "we want meetings to be incorporated and with proper results."
For almost eight years I have been local Labour MP, the five GC meetings on the Friday evening have always been the same.
Where it is bad today, this modern meeting is not the dream of a meeting that we usually have of "humanity and soft, lower" politicians have forgotten if, otherwise, they should not start again.
It seems to be a growing trend that differs from one another is not accepted in the Labour group and the whole opinion is checked before being accepted by the majority of the lookers.
This starts after Jeremy entered the administration chair, as if I had previously planned to share with him in a similar political outlook and to be expected to change quickly and to take over areas I would not agree with; either by national security or trade or even by any EU.
Whenever I speak openly-and I don't care about what follows the harassment on the pages of communication is said to be lowered on the seat, not to be accepted by the state politics, I am told I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that’s my own experience.
Likewise, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my workmates, as clients are brought directly to me and they want to become political activists.
I respect the skills and the determination of my colleagues who are facing the day - to - day pressures of sexual or racial abuse but who are not able to get away from them.
One of the most controversial features of this world is politics.
Jeremy Corbyn explained this past week that the Labour group had adopted the culture of tolerance.
The fact is that it is no longer large and in a form of "mutchy" or of changing the principles of the group that have become clear.
I have many suggestions in the past two years asking me to let go, not to talk about how I talk and then "all is well."
But that is no longer the political solution.
Since I joined Labour in the 32th year as a student, being persuaded by the Thachcher government to ignore the room in which I had left it down, since then I have vowed to fight for the best of the people and those who need it, especially if I have been a good man or a government officer.
I did not hide my involvement in politics, including this past election.
No one in the East of Nottingham can be confused by any way about my position in my police, and in the places where I do not agree with current leaders.
In these improved circumstances now on Friday, in all cases, I would say that when Brexit influenced you in houses, businesses and our public services, I don't understand his desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Body.
Be sure that the one message I have does not go to Nottingham Momentum, to my people, whether they are members of Labour or those who are: I take pride in working under you and promise that no value to give up in the face or to help with politics would prevent me from doing what I believe is your best interests all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr riding ahead
The two sterns are inclined towards the end of the mains leading to the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves this fine victory for the Tennett's Premiership Day game.
Now they increase the quality, the main part of the division.
Finally, it was their high - quality protection, as well as their opportunity to take a better turn, resulting in a breach of family responsibility with instructor Peter Murchie.
"We have been tested in our games to the present, and we are not beaten, therefore I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says: "Respecting Ayr, do better than we have done."
Grant Anderson was 14 minutes in his try, changed by Frizier Climo, and put Ayr ahead, but, with Scottish Scottish rap card Rory Hughes, released by the Warriers, allowed Melrose to make the charges tell and Jason Baggot to try to change them.
Climo outlined Ayr's leadership with thepenty, before, in the half-time of the game, she entered the score and then changed the point try to form 17-5 to Ayr during rest.
However, Melrose has started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson' passed, converted by Baggot, reduced 5 points.
It has been said that long since Ruarishh Knot, who has been put out of a coma, Ayr’s new Ayr road has increased rapidly by Stafford McDowell, translated by Climo.
Ayr Captain Blair Macpherson has been given a purple card, and again, Melrose has fined another man with Bruce Colvine’s unexisted tire, under intense pressure.
However, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card because of Climo without a ball outside the pencil line, McPerson went to sleep back as the Ayr looked up.
Climo has changed, as it was almost since it was started again, after Kyle Rowe had gathered David Armstrong’s balls into the box and sent thefle Gregor Henry until he installed a fifth tire.
The Still Game Officer appears to be interested in a new service in the field of the rostre
Still Game Officer Kieran appears to be committed to the reception section after it has been found to be appointed as the director of a licensed hangout company.
A 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, and another expert in humor named Greg Hemphill.
The two had already announced that the next nine rounds would be the last to conduct the show, and it seems that Kimeran is preparing to do something else after Craiglong.
According to the record, he is the ruler of the Adriftmorn Limited.
This player does not want to comment on this article, although the Scottish Sun source has said that Kernian wants to join the "well-leading industry" in Glasgow.
Our ‘ Seas ’: Bolivia, which is closed to the world to hope that the road will open the road to the Pacific
Sailors lie guarded at the masthead in La Paz.
Public floats wave a blue flag.
The battle-fleets from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are bound up with the words: "Our sea is by law.
To receive it again is our duty.
Throughout Bolivia's closed world, the memories of Chile's sea coasts in the war of wealth that resulted in the great flow of blood in the 19th century are as vivid as they are to the desire to make their way back to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes have been higher for centuries, as Bolivia is awaiting a federal court’s judgment on October 1 after five years of discussion.
" Bolivia is strong, spirit of unity and calm, and wait in good spirit for the outcome," says Roberto Calladilla, Bolivia's ambassador.
Many people in Bolivia will hear the judgment of the World’s Constitutional Court on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will stand up in Bolivia’s four - decade - long town of discussion and on the Chilean one being forced to consider giving Bolivia a more impressive land into the sea.
Evo Morales, a life - and - descent president of Bolivia who faces a difficult war - to - be chosen again in the next year - also has much to do with this Monday sentence.
"We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean," confirm what it says towards the end of August.
But some social analysts say that it is impossible for a court to pass judgment on the Bolivian side of town to change that.
The United Nations Committee established in the Netherlands-has no power to remove Chile's land, and it claims that it cannot know the results of possible speech.
The fact that the court of the World’s Constitutional Court was only six months after the trial indicates that the case was "free from disturbances," says Piz Zárate, a Chilean authority on national legislation.
And instead of supporting Bolivia’s desires, four years may take her back.
"A matter of sea access has been seized by the existing Bolivian government," says Zárate.
Morales ’ words of war have ended any kindness they still had in Chile, namely.
Bolivia and Chile will speak again one day, but it will be hard to hold discussions after this.
These two countries have not been in league since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, has denounced the decision as a sudden decision.
Monday will give Bolivia "a special opportunity to reveal on a new co-operation sheet with Chile" and the opportunity for "ending 139 years of friction with benefits," he says.
Calcutta has also denied the fact that Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - uses the sea as a political party.
"Bil Bolivia will never lose its right to reach the Pacific Ocean" and stop doing so.
"This judgment is an opportunity to see if we have to overcome things that happened in the past."
North Korea claims that it will not dispose of nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
Northern Korea High Commissioner Ri Yong Ho says that his country would never be rid of its nuclear arsenal if he did not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking about Saturday in the United Nations Constitutional House.
He has asked the United States to follow up the promises made during the Singapore summits.
With these words, President Mike Pompio appears to be about to start a nuclear exchange that had been dropped more than three months after that of Singapore and Kim Jong Unun, from North Korea.
Ri says it is "the myth of the day" that the continuing rise and refusal of the United States is a declaration that will end the Korean War will even cause the North to surrender.
Washington is careful to agree to this agreement before Pyongyng begins to take steps to break off these weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump were looking for a second conference.
But many doubt that Pyongyang is willing to give up the land’s weapons as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang in the coming month to prepare for the conference of Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion display shows the latest variety of hats you will see on the streets of a nearby town
If you want to increase the hats you have or want to block the sun, then don't go anywhere else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne began to make a large collection of the most unusual hats of the SS19 exhibits that have fallen off the deck set up in the Paris Cane.
These amazing hats have filled the Instagogram in this summer, and these designers have sent their awesome hats to the exhibition.
Valentino's lone hat is a broad becket and covers the whole head of the crew.
Some of the overloaded hats included jewelry, a coat of jewelry, and even a pins, but it was not designed to warm your head.
Thomas Browne, on the other hand, brought with him a series of unusual masks right up to the time of the Nohepe period.
Many of these colorful masks have artificial lips drawn and are much like Hannibal Legter rather than fashionable fashions.
One hat was like entering the water with a breathing apparatus and throat, while the other was like a crushed ice cream.
And if you like fads and trends, you are fortunate.
Fads are said to be coming where you live.
These outstanding hats are at the feet of the LaBomba's, a two-footed sun hat worn by people like Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The book that had made these unusual covers that had filled the communications pages has brought another big picture — a grass bag carried along the coast, almost as large as a bathman in your hand.
The Raffia orange bag, with the top ends of the raffia with a white feather, was the top of the Jacquemus's collection of La Riviera SS19 in Paris's F.
The famous designer Luke Aritage has told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see the large hats and beach bags reach the people in the next type - as the designers have sunk them will be difficult to ignore the people who will have sought' here the most great things.'
John Edward: Important linguistic skills for people of the world
Scotland's private schools have a reputation for academic achievement, and this has continued in 2018 with some of the outcomes of uninterrupted examinations, which are strengthened by individuals and the success of the sports team, the arts, music and other public projects.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to offer a high standard of service to both students and parents.
Unique schools are trying to prepare their students for higher education, their free courses, and their environment as worldly people.
As a school curriculum that can design and fit the school library, we see the available languages going on as a favorite and required course in school.
Nelson Mandela once observed: ‘ If you speak to a person in a language he understands, he reaches his mind.
If you talk to him in his language, you reach his goal."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English for the sake of friendship and trust with immigrants.
From the recent results of the test, we can see that languages are high on the table at the highest level of secondary schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign-linguists have received articles at Higher Grade A.
The data gathered, in the 77 member schools of the SCIS, indicates that 72 percent of students received the Highhead A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students learning German, 69 percent of French students and 66 percent of those who read Spanish received A.
This illustrates that boarding schools in Scotland promote foreign - language skills that children and young people definitely need in the future.
Now languages, such as the study being chosen, are held in equal esteem as STEM courses (science, technology, neering and metimatics) in private schools and other schools.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons given by employers for the problem of flooding, 17 percent is associated with the lack of language skills.
As a result, more and more language skills will be needed to prepare young people for future tasks.
As more work opportunities require languages, these developments are vital in the working world.
Regardless of one’s choice, if you learn another language, you will have more time to develop the same skill in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people of other nations opens up opportunities for a person who knows many languages.
According to a UK test of You Gov of 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak another language well enough to communicate and only French is spoken more than a cent.
That is why investment in language is now important to children.
A knowledge of many languages, especially those in developing lands, will equip children with a good job.
In Scotland each school will be divided into the languages we teach.
A number of schools will concentrate on the modern languages of the past, while others will teach the languages that are thought to be the most important in the UK when viewed in20, such as Mandarin or Japan.
No matter what your child likes, there will always be a number of languages in which you can choose from private schools, and there are also excellent teachers in this section.
Scotland’s independent schools are eager to provide an educational environment that will equip children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter where they go in the future.
There is no denying, in the world’s business situation, that languages continue to play an important role in the future of this world, so this must be seen in education.
In fact, modern languages must be viewed as "the ability to communicate with the world."
The independent schools will continue to offer this option, separation and resignation to young people in Scotland.
Il free bien lefee.

Lebron will break a Lakers record on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting for the followers who want to see Lebron James begin the Los Angeles Lakes.
Lakers Trainer Luke Walton announced that James would play on the Sunday tragedy scene against Denver Nugges in San Diego.
But the next look will show how much time it will take for you to play.
"You will be more than one or less than 48," said Walton in the official Lakers website.
Lakers story Mike Trudell suggests that James may have played less than a minute.
After exercising in the early days of the week, James was asked about his plans for the tragedy of Lakes.
"I don't want pre-smoker games at this stage of my work to be good," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rilly Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins his long - standing conference this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump’s first five planned for the next week include a visit to friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the certificate title is established until he chooses to present him to the Supreme Court session, Trump tries to reduce the election support since the Republicans are in danger of losing the Congestion at the election of Nov.
When will Trump’s convention in West Virginia be held this evening, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump convention of Wheeling, West Virginia, is held for 7 p.m. ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see the West Virginia convention of Trump on the Internet via liverim in You Tube.
Trump is considered to speak at the meeting of this week of the High Court athlete Brett Kavanough, who is in a difficult situation because of charges of sexual incompatibility that will be set up for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans to withstand the election of November.
As a result, the President Trump’s campaign said that these five conferences the next week are aimed at "in the strength of volunteers and sponsors as the Republicans try to protect and increase their number in the Legal House and Legal House," says the Reuters.
‘ Control Congres is so important to him that the president will go to as many countries as possible as we approach a busy coffeehouse," the speaker of Tump who didn't want to know what the Reuters announces.
Written at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this modern fact of the night can build support from "Ohio and Pensylvania and is also known in Pittsburgh for its subject," says West Virginia City News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, which the state section won by 40 percent over in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican Secretary Patrick Morrison, who is behind this election.
"It is not a good sign for Morisey that the president is obliged to turn on him for support," says Simon Header, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: An American team indicates that if you’re hungry you’ll continue to fight like one who looks forward to going to individual sports on Sunday.
After three games alone, play as the first four persons was the demand for the Ryder Cup.
The top position in any group has given the impression of sports in which the players really believe, and in the same competition.
Who is thus described as moving ahead in the meantime?
‘ Pay them six points and now four, ’ says Jordan Spieth while he goes the same day.
Europe took this opportunity, in fact, with 4 points over and 12 others that have not yet been verified.
The Americans, as Spiegel says, that they feel good and can get a lot of attention from them, including how Spieth and Justin played well all day and that the couple have three to four points.
Spiegel has always played well since it began and paid for an example.
When people shout with great excitement as they shout, he puts the ball in a crucial position to win the game after he and Thomas are hit with two notes.
Beating a ball in a win - win pit at the age of 15 has caused people to shout the same way, in a way that tells them that an American team is losing.
"You have to worry about your game at all," says Spiegel.
They have left the matter in themselves.
18 holes to mark them.
Players with the tops of Spieth and Thomas on the previous two days by Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleet, the opposition story of the Ryder Cup
Europe’s roads bring out the exception and cannot do anything wrong.
"A couple called "Moliwood" is the one that does not strike the bogey on Saturday afternoon and Saturday morning on Friday afternoon with the Back Wines on Friday morning.
That cooperation, along with their interest, seems to be more attractive to the masses as the performers of the church, and no other popular player can conquer Europe when the sun sets on the Golf National than the Fleetwood and the Munari.
It is better to play together at the same time in different places.
Talk about the success of Europe is still not seen, however
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson did the work of Sergio Garcia, a four-ball hero in the morning, when he got a co-oper with Alex Nore.
The Bogey and the other two points on the line are four and a Spanish pit and a Seduscean could not escape.
On Sundays, though, no one can help you get out of that hole.
Four footballs and four players enjoy watching them close together because of the cooperation of the participants, their advice, their advice not to give, and how the schedule may change in a short time.
Europe has played better as a group up until now and takes the lead to the last day, but four players have shown that the American team is hungering for the unbelievable relief, particularly the Stateside.
Europe heads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will take the lead well on the last day of the Ryder Cup after four articles and four sports events have paid 10-6 Americans.
It is of interest to the couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary to change the game so as to win the hardshipable Tiger Woods to advance the Gulf National in four articles.
The European case of Thomas Bjorn, desiring to win the rod that defeated them in Hazeltine in the past two years ago, won the morning American case with four points, winning a series of games in 311.
America did not accept the four games, but they won the games, even though they could not put an end to the debt.
Jim Furyk’s case requires eight articles on 12 private sports to receive this gift
Fleetwood was the first European to draw four points and be new at the same time as Munari, called "Molliwood" after the weekend of the first couple winning four points when the Ryder Cup was opened.
Woods and Patrick Reed, in four football pools, have passed over the Woodsn and the American knight Brysin Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who has drawn himself to the two Saturday games, has shown interest there and interest but divided 19 to 29 games in four balls and four players in a row
Justin Rose is retired in the morning of the four four hours, and with his companion Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes in 21 and 1 in opposing Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - leading world
Europe had not been easy on France.
Three times his father, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas made a good impression on the Americans on a Saturday.
They were able to win by 2 and 1 when playing with the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of the four four fo'als apart the Poulter and the Rory McIlroy by 4 and 3 of the four hours cut off with the two opening hole.
Twice on the Ryder Cup the team returns from the division with four notes going to individual sports, although Fulyk’s role requires playing without one to win.
After two days, the Sunday attack stopped them.
The North Korea says that ‘ she will never complete her weapons before she has gained protection.
The Ministry of Foreign Center in North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that these sentences made it unreliable among America and there was no way that America could complete its Nuclear materials if she could obtain security certificates.
Ri Yong Ho has told the audience board to take positive action last year, such as to stop the armament test and to drop the Nuclear facilities, and to promise that we should no longer make Nuclear instruments.
"We don't see the corresponding steps from America," he said.
"Unless there is no promise from America, there will be no hope for the security of our country and in this case we will never lose our weapons without speaking to America."
While R once again saying what is commonly said by North Korea about American refusal to finish Nuclear's equipment in subsections, the North Korea is rewarded for the small measures they have taken, his report did not deny Pyongyng to complete the defective weapons.
R Ri told of a joint report by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first conference between the president of America and the North Korean emperor who was in Singapore on June 12, when Kim offered to work for "the Nuclear weapons instead of Korea" while Trump promised the security of Korea.
North Korea wanted to put an end to the Korean war of 1950-53 in terms of justice, but America said Pyynyang should first eliminate Nuclear's equipment.
The Wahington appeals are rare to reduce the harsh international sentences facing North Korea.
"America forces "the completion of Nuclear instruments first" and increases the pressure level by orders to accomplish their purpose in a forced, opposed to the declarations of the end of war," says R.
"The idea that sentences can frighten us is a false dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that these sentences increase mistrust.
Ri did not discuss the plans of another conference for Kim and Trump, of which the American leader spoke before the United Nations this week.
Instead, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and the South emperor of Korea, Mon Jae-in five months ago and added: "If the team in this case of Nuclear is South Korea, not America, is it possible to finish Nuclear's equipment instead of Korea.
However, Ri's statement sounds different than last year, when speaking to the general U.N. conference that the targeting of North Korean flying instruments in the United States was inevitable after the "Mn. The Evil President" called Kim "man of flying instruments" for suicide.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "put an end to" North Korea, has courageously given Kim a praise by taking steps to destroy weapons, but that is more than much work and will remain far from North Korea to finish Nuclear's equipment.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no fixed time for that, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps he has taken.
Even so, American secretary - general Mike Pompio told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The execution of the judgment of the Security Council does not go on too far until we see the complete and sure destruction of Nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has presented sentences in North Korea since 2006 for the elimination of the financial budget of Pyonyang's flying equipment.
Pompeo met Ri over the U.N. General Assembly and said he would visit Pyynyang again for the second conference.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his final visit has not come without success.
He left Pyynyang in July, saying that there was a progress made, but North Korea was independent of the "Pyynyangs."
North Korea promised to meet Moon this month so that they could break up the space of the flying Nuclear if America's "actual steps."
He told Kim that the "intermediate measures" that Trump had promised for security in Singapore and further development in normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students getting adequate rest
A new study at Harvard University this year made all the students who have not yet covered themselves sleep enough to fight the habit of learning all night with caffeine.
One expert found that students at the university do not have a foundation to support themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep specialist at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigham and Women's hospital, conducted this study, believed that for the first time in America.
He was encouraged by his talk about the effects of lack of sleep on the students.
'When one of her classmates finished the class, a girl came and said: ‘ Why am I told that now, will I finish school?'
She said that no one told her how important it was to sleep, as she told The Telegraph.
This study started this year, explains the benefits of sleeping in connection with the development of education and sports, including improving their general health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and a university director of health - care services, said that the university has decided to bring up the subject after finding students who do not sleep well.
It is an hour - long course that involves a series of joyful activities.
In one section there is a picture of the university bedroom, where students click coffee cups, curtains, training outfits and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects the development of sports.
In one section, participants are told how lack of sleep increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The school map, with its many fascinating features, encourages its participants to focus on their daily activities.
‘ We know that we will never change the conduct of the students' immediately.
Even so, we believe they have a right to know - as you have the right to know the health effects of using drums," says educator Czeisler, adding.
The tendency to take pride in sleep is still present, he says, in addition that modern technology and pressure among students is a growing problem.
To make sure that you do not get enough sleep should be an unaccustomed weapon to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, and also avoid gaining weight, just as sleep impairs the brain and keeps it hungry.
Raymond So, 19 - year - old from California, a professor of chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler to make a study of this class, after attending his first class in his first year in Harvard.
He says that the class was open to him and that he was interested in making the class available to the whole school.
He hopes that the next step will invite the lone student to pursue a similar reading program before he is able to enter the competition center.
Czeisler recommends that students think that they make a sleep alarm, as well as wake, and that they should be aware of the dangerous effects of the light on the electric light and the light of the LED, which can interfere with your daily routine, which can pay for sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers Men Men of Gerrard on one point.
The Rangers also encountered a problem when playing while Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrad with one point on an egg (1-0) in Livingston.
The Ibrix's risk of losing is still in progress after St Johnstone struck 41 in February. But Mary Holt's team struck Gerrard for the second time in the 18 games, which began to be the master's being healed of eight points except the leading class at Ladbrokes Premierships, the Heats.
Menga received an article a few minutes before the half-time and the Rangers's players were not interested.
While the Rangers came down in the sixth place, Livingston rose to the third after it was the Hibernian leaving it with one point.
And there are problems with the Rangers after the Lienesman is treated with head injuries after he has been struck by a cast from the side of the players who have gone away.
Gerard has changed the older players to Ayr time in the game before the last Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt continues with 11 of Livingstone's same participants taking the same point at the Hearts last week and cheering on the way his team has beaten his opponents in all manner.
The Rangers have controlled the game, but Livingstone has done more while finding the ball.
He should have played a score in the second minute when a Menga player allows Scott Pittman to pass to the Alllan McGregor parties but the middle player did not find them.
Keaghan Jacobs won a ball discovered by Craig Halket, but his partner, Alan Lithglow, was able to open it wide in the rear wheels.
The Rangers had received no control but seemed more optimistic than beliefs about the third before the last game.
Aredo Morelos feels he should have received a pencil in half an hour's mark as he and Steve Lawles collided with each other but Stepve Thomson ignored the Colombian player's cry.
The Rangers had a chance to kick a ball near the ball before the first stage of the game, but a barmaid of Ibrix Liam Kelly had found no problem with a ball with Lassana Colibaly's head and with Ovie Ejaria's.
While Livingstone received the first article in 34 minutes that had been difficult to find, no one would deny that it is truly worth it without any effort at all.
Rangers too failed to prevent Jacobs from winning the ball.
Scott Arfield did not act like the Declan Gallagher who passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who didn't feel anxious to succeed Menga.
Gerard made the first changes as he turned Coulibaly to the change for Ryan Kent, and the result was immediate as the performer turned over to Morelos but the star ran away and saved him.
But Livingston continued to make the crew play the same thing they wanted, and Lithgow and Halket were throwing the ball away.
The Holt group could get an article at the start of the game, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow put it on the shoulders by the head.
One recent gangster, Glenn Middleton, had another case of sentence as he met Jacobs, but he too ignored Pam.
Almanac: Geiger Counterator
And now a page from "Send Morning Morning" Almanac: On September 30, 1882, some 136 years ago today, and... the date that scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of observation and monitoring radioactivity, which was developed by this development called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has also been used in pop culture as well, as in movies in 1950 known as "Balls of Corongao," whose uninterested players are scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
He: "What is that?
Rogers: "It is Geiger County, used to search for precious stones.
When you put these things in your ears, you will hear the results of the Atoms emitted by radios.
Evans: "Speak, it's really appearing now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 36th birthday.
But this declaration bearing his name will live on.

Kane West Disallows Trump’s Support for Speaks, Carrying a Sacrifice written by MGA, after coming out of the SNL.
Not Very Well
Kane West received no bit of support during the Saturday Right Live after a sultry of bringing praise to the American President Donald Trump and said he would join the election in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, Ghot Town, which he sang with a pocket - size notebook composed of Mike America Great, he spoke against Democrats and repeated his support.
"Many times when I talk to a white person when they say: 'How can you love Trump?'
And I say, if I were concerned about race, I would have gone a long time ago, ” he said.
SNL began its program with a video showing Matt Damon’s taunt on Brett Kavanough’s testimony before the Committee on Sexual Abuse and Sexual Harassment from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not distributed, this West video is displayed in chat rooms by humor Chris Rock.
It is not clear that Rock has been trying to make fun of this video for West.
Also, West is angry with viewers by encountering difficulties before he enters over his hat.
"They have abused me back."
They stop, ‘ Don't come in with the hat that you carry.'
They have abused me!
And I was in a submersion area," says, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "Do you want to see the bottom?" which means you will wear "superman's clothing, since it means what I want to do. Do you want the world to continue?
Try to show love.
His talks received no support from the viewer and the SNL staff to be embarrassed, says the Varianity, and another person who says: "All the slide is silent."
The West has been brought into place of the Ariana Grande, who lost her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller in the last few days.
West has shown many that sing I Love It, which, like Perrier Bottle, has hit her.
West received support from the head of the TPSA unit, who wrote to Twitter: "I’m talking to a very courageous person: I Thank you FOR THE REDEFINATION."
And co-ordinator Karen Hunter wrote to Twitter that the West just "he behaved as if he was not really present and is marvelously present."
"But I have decided not to pay for a person (by buying his music or giving him support for his "ability" ability) which I believe he has adopted and produces harmful ideas in my society.
He is free.
We, too," says he.
Before the system, this rapper informed his followers in Twitter that he had changed his name justly, saying he was known as "Aye West by justice now."
He is not the first singer to change his name and follow the steps of the Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
The rap singer, Snoop Dogg, has changed his name to Snoop Lion and the dying musician of the old history announced by the Lance, who changed his name into a symbol.

Vit Harrington’s Game of Thorns speaks of trying to make oneself a dangerous husband
Kit Harrington is known to carry a sword as he imitates Jon Snow in the old violent film HBO, the Game of Thrones.
But this 31 - year - old pupil spoke out against what many people believe about this powerful warrior, saying that such roles make boys feel that they have to pretend to be strong for glory.
Kit believes in ‘ putting up a bad thing' and wondered how to deal with the problem of sex in a dangerous way during the period of #Me Too
Kit, married to his companion in the Game of Threes Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, has admitted to ‘ feeling difficult ’ about coping with the problem.
‘ I feel very hard, for myself, right now, where is we not walking as men?'
‘ What have we taught men when they are growing up about the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that a telescope plays a role in the struggle to create a man in a dangerous way because of his male role models.
He adds: ‘ What is taught?
What is taught in television, in the streets, that boys think it’s unfair to become men?
What do I think is the most important question at this time?
Because there is clearly something wrong with our boys.
In the interview she even admitted that she would never play the movie again when this coming version was over, saying that ‘ you have finished with wars and horses'.
Since November Kit will be featured in the animated film Sam Sherpad's True West, the story of the producer of the show staring with his brother-in-law, who is a robber.
The critic says that he feels that contacting Rose is the best thing from the Game of Trones.
"I met my wife in this manner, and she helped me find my family and my life from now on."
Rose imitated Jgrette, whose boyfriend, Jon Snow, imitated Kit, this handicraft film that won a lot of competition.
The couple were married in June 2018 at the home of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/ADis: China reports a 14% increase in new patients.
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people were affected in the country, says medical authorities.
An estimated 40,000 cases were diagnosed in the first quarter of 2018 alone.
More often than not, people are sexually affected.
Naturally, many people in China are affected by blood transfusions.
But when the number of victims of such mistreatment has been reduced to totality, health officials in China say so at the Yunnan summit.
Each year, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection is a real problem for the people of the LGBT in China.
Homosexuality is no longer a part of China since 1997, but discrimination against the people of the LGBT is said to be difficult.
Because this country has such unconventional visions, research has made it clear that men who have sex with 70-90% will marry men who are round about.
The often affected effect is not sufficiently safe for sex in this relationship.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised access to HIV drugs as part of the treatment.
The Maxine Waters reported information about the GOP websites issued by an employee at an invalid cultural level, there arose a ‘ complicated lie ’ and a ‘official ’ issue.
American ambassador Maxine Waters charged on Saturday that one of his employees had to add personal details to the personal affairs of the American Presbyterian conductors in Wipedia.
According to the Los Angeles Democrat, these statements are advertised by experts and Web sites that take their side.
"A lie, a lie and a lot of lies," says Waters in the report to Twitter.
In these reports the details are issued for home addresses and phone numbers of these Americans. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee include Orrin Hach, Utah.
These headlines appear in the Internet on Thursday, introduced by an unknown person at Capitol Hill at a time instead of the council’s talk about the lack of self-control and the guilt of the High Commissioner Bret Kavanough.
Some time later these computers had cast off Kavanough questions.
Wise Web sites such as the Gates Pinit and the Red State reported that the IP addresses indicate that the source of the leaks from Waters office has even issued some traces of Waters's employee, says The Hill.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false," adding Waters.
"A member of my employees - put at risk because personal information has been released because of these false charges which are not available - has not been responsible for the removal of these defects.
This groundless charge is absolutely false.
Waters' report received a quick criticism from the Internet, including the former secretary of the American attorney Arischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"That indicates that he does not have the degree to be a members of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, it is not necessary to feel angry.
He does not have to fight.
He does not have to ask the accuser’s motives.
It is necessary to be calm and cool.
Fleischer might have compared Waters ’ reply with the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being very angry on Thursday.
The Omar Navarro, the Republican galaxies that fit the election to extract Waters during the year, also announced his turn to Twitter.
"Magnifiers if true," writes the Twitter.
In his noise, Waters said his office to inform the "standard authorities and the courts of the law on false charges.
We will ensure that the suspects are exposed," he added, "and they will pay legally for their dangerous actions to my employees.
Johnny English Strikes Against - a defeated truck of the Rowan Atkinses
It is common for days to examine objects about Brexit when watching the English - related spectacle and similar to the age - old cheery and truck violence the Johnny English - which was recovered in 2003 and returned in 2011 as the Johnny English Reborn.
Will you talk about the news that we can no longer sell abroad?
This papal legion named Johnny English receives his license to renew his name, showing that he is a mark made by non - English observers.
She is really the most skilled and creative activity of the State, in contrast with the little Clousau, and the Mur. Bean's and at least one boy who sings a piece of song in the Chariots of Fire at the opening of London's Orimphils in 2012.
He even becomes the international best-detectable traveler of Atkinson who has ever been influenced by the television commercials of the Barclaycard, leaving behind any arguments he went there.
There is one or two hours in this film to watch JE.
I liked when Johnny English came to the helicopter in his front guard clothes while the helicopter struck his hat.
Atkinson's gift of humor is interesting, but it is not strong when compared with such heavy products as 007 and the Mission Amossinsins, which include now laughs.
These laughs are like children and not adults, when I make my own statement of laughter by Johnny English does not show how much ability compared with Atkinson’s quiet show while playing Bean
News in this exhibition is of great difficulty to the English.
The Internet holder has unwittingly entered the net of stores in the Internet, having seen details of all the English solutions that work, until it struck a professional professional role - the relatively small role of Kevin Eldon.
The news goes through with a proud high official, who is faced with political insubordination: Emma Thompson tries to do what is right as he plays Teresa May but the writer of the film did not do well when he wrote it.
Wise counselors tell her that, like all the arrows, they are at risk, being forced to return to the inactive one.
And that is what little Johnny English himself, who has become the principal teacher in school, says, but gives classes irrecoverably as a private instrument, while England teaches in a way that is strangely more intelligent than ever.
England is sent back to Whitewall and told of the emergency to meet her former friend Bough, who was playing by Ben Miller again.
Bough is a married man, married to the Admiralty.
The couple who are able to do the wrong thing in an intelligent job task are returning to work, and they meet the Ophelia Bulléveser of Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, a high - ranking official believes that he can solve the problems of the English computer: the evil man Jason Volts, played by Jake Rayy
England and Bough started that rash: making themselves food suppliers, burning French food store; starting problems while boarding the Volta class; and England brings an attack when they refuse to use the Vartual Reality for the study of the interior of Volta's house.
Everything is done in the final sections, though interesting and entertaining, rather than the television programs of children talk about all of this.
Common Objects.
As with all the other spectacular displays of Johnny English: I wonder if this business is a great English show that it can give Rowan Atkinson a good role in his profession?
The task force denies that they have made plans for British citizens to work four days but to be paid five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s work force set up a plan to get employees to work four days a week — but paid five days ’ wages.
According to reports, the group requires company executives to pay for wages when companies work with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) to give them a day.
This change will result in a three - day weekend — but only for the same reward.
The sources say that this plan will be ‘ well suited to the economic ideas of this group and the national reform plans to take part in the work force.
The switch to a four - day week assigns the support of the Trade Union Congress as a means for employees to take part in economic reform.
The high source of the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: ‘ System monitoring is expected to be introduced before the year passes.
‘ Not immediately, but a four-day work week is the ideal idea for this class's economic rating to be alongside the employees and business arrangements of this group.'
The task force was not the first to provide support for such an idea, and the Green Party made a four-day schedule while strengthening the election in 2017.
This program does not at present get full support from Labour Party, however.
A spokesman for the Service Team said: ‘ The week of four days of work is not a team policy and is not something to watch.'
Assistant director John McDonnell used a previous work conference to explain his position on an economic translation that helps people.
Sir McDonnell says that he is determined to take up the power of ‘ the rulers who don't want to be seen' and ‘ who win' in big business.
The service officer's schedule says that water suppliers have not received their assignment as the service government could pay ‘ prices ’ that they are not doing well.
He reaffirmed his plan to put employees in positions of management in business and to make a joint fund for the purpose of giving the employees a 10 - percent share of nongovernmental enterprises to give them as much as £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI would change their thinking
A study of the FBI charges made by the judge Brett Kavanaugh delays the final vote of his being taken to the Supreme Court each week, and raises the question if the results of the investigation of the institute can change the extent of the situation of the former Republicans to change their minds with the support they give.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, a reporter for "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the former Presbyterian John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that could cause them to close their minds.
Kennedy’s heart has been touched by his comments from South Carolina.
"Yes" says Kennedy.
"I'm going to come into the pit, and I'll talk to the judge Kavanough."
I call after this is heard, after the charges have been issued, and have I said, ‘ Have you done it? ’
She was calm, confident, fearless.
It seems, though, that Graham’s vote will never change.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kansaugh and a heavy whistle," says.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what was going on, but what I know: Brett has made a strong denial of these are the hoots," added Graham, speaking with Chris Blastine Blasey Ford.
And every man he speaks of can verify these charges.
36 years
I can't see the change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday, New York City welcomes the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a moving - to - heart song presentation and a good purpose; an end to poverty.
The event has now reached its final stage, and it welcomes tens of thousands of people in Centra; Park, not just to have fun with such factors as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to inform them of the real purpose of the event — to end a severe depression by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an additional section for the Global Poverty Project, an international institution that hopes to eliminate poverty by adding to its burden - bearing people.
To get a free ticket to a party (unless you are willing to pay for a WIP ticket), you must do a volunteer work such as writing a e - mail to a world client, calling on the phone, or any meaningful means of introducing other people to their welfare.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been at the age of 12 been in accomplishing its purpose?
Is it a good idea to give people free of charge the right way to get support - people feel they are making a difference by signing an Internet protest or putting a message in Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has reported that it has forgotten that 19 million acts have been performed by its supporters, with varying objectives.
It said that these actions have helped to encourage world taxpayers to make reports of vows and financial systems that will be responsible for the lives of over 2.25 million people in 2030.
Early in 2018, the team described vows and 390 records for their actions, costing $10 million.
This group claims that their income has helped nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of these commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a financial institution that has made it possible for the U.K for the purpose of "helping children grow up to this level," the institution promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help bring an end to malnutrition in that country after they received 4,700 messages from the Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, sponsors, national governments and international Citizens like you, we can be able to resolve the injustice of malnutrition," says the representative of The Power of Nutrition Ullman to inform the multitudes during the social event in London in April 2018.
The team said after some 5,000 acts asking the U.K to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government informed the government of the cost to cope with the problem, in The Power of Nutrition, which would help mothers and children to provide food.
When they answer one of the most common questions asked on the Internet site, "What do you think we can get to a great deal of trouble?
The Global Citizen said: "A long and difficult road - sometimes will fall and fall.
But like human rights translation and the struggle for dissimilarness before us, we will succeed, for we are strong in dealing with others.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, and others who will make you happy at the New York annual party, will be welcomed by Deborra-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use seawater to impede Russia’s supply of energy - the Secretary of State
America can find protection under a naval force for the purpose of preventing Russia from exporting energy, including in the Middle East, explains U.S. Secretary of State, Ryan, as does The Washington Examiner.
She has charged Russia with responsibility in Syria - where the government’s ministers are legally in charge to investigate new methods of power power.
"I believe that their goal of being in the Middle East is to trade other countries as Europe had done in Eastern Europe, South European," says.
And, according to the officers, there are ways and powers to deal with it.
"America has the power, by the navy, to make sure that seaways are open, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that their electricity does not go to the market," says.
All were talking to the participants at a ceremony adopted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself "in terms of electric power" in America.
Then he compared the methods America faced with Russia and Iran, which he says have not changed.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia, is almost, to raise costs and to replace oil," that is, while calling Russia for a single-power-power-resistant donor.
This report comes from following Trump’s efforts to encourage exports of water from Europe, into Russia’s capital, without much higher prices for the people of Europe.
As a result, the officers of Trump’s government, including American President Donald Trump, tried to stop Germany from supporting the "unjust" work of the Nord Stream 2, according to Trump, the task has done to Germany "prison" of Russia.
Russia has also claimed that this Nord Stream 2 billion-million-million-million, will double the current one to 110 billion cubic meters, is a good job beyond the economy.
Russia says that American opposition to the project has economic reasons and is an example of inferior competition.
"I believe these powers should not be a force for pressure, and the buyers must be able to select the merchants," says the Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak after the conference of American Secretary of Power Rick Perry in Moscow on September.
America’s position in this situation has not been well accepted in Germany, which has strengthened its determination to do this work.
A leading firm in this industry, the National Institute for German Business (BDI), has requested that America be moved away from the EU powers and treaties concerning Germany and Russia.
"I have a big problem when the third world is disrupting our strength." says Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federal Business Center (BDI) after a meeting with German statesman Angela Merket and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will consider it difficult" to join the national election in 2020, says the Massachusetts satellite.
The Massachusetts Networker Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that it would be difficult "to consider" to enter the election of the president after the election of half-time.
At the city hall in Hall Hall, Warren from Massachusetts was sure that he would join the election.
"It is time for the people who have settled down to Washington and to set up our broken state and that includes the presence of a person in a high position," says The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider it difficult to enter the election of the President."
Warren spoke badly of the president Donald Trump at the city hall, saying that his father "this world is in the wrong way.
"I am concerned more about what Donald Trump will do to our freedoms," he says.
Warren is known for criticizing Trump and his High Court prisoner Brett Kavanaugh.
Writing to Twitter on Friday, Warren said, "Yes we need a FBI investigation before we are able to vote.
Nevertheless, the votes issued on Thursday show that many Warren’s followers thought that it was not a good idea to enter the election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the people's "considered" that the Massachusetts votes should not enter the election, according to the Suffolk Political Research Center/Boston Globe Polll.
Thirty-two gave support to this opinion.
These votes have shown much support to the old sweetener Deval Patrick, 38 percent supported their election.
Some of the names of the Democrats mentioned in connection with the 2020th election include the postmaster Joe Biden and the Vermontese Sanders.
Biden said that he would decide justly on January, says Associated Press.
Sarah Pin speaks of Track Paran at Trump
Track Palan, 26 years old, is living in Iraq for a year after joining the army with Seppence.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence and Monday night
"What my son hears, what he hears again, I feel for other families dealing with the problems of PTSD and other injuries our returnts." He told those who were present at Trump's surrender in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

She was arrested on Monday at Yasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence by beating a person round and having a sound equipment, according to Yasilla police spokesman Dan Bennett.
The 18 American and D.C government departments provide support in granting the new law to those who seek protection.
Eighteen government sections and the Colombian area provide support to the new law that deters victims from gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 sectors of the government and the region have signed a resolution to provide support to one of the safety - seeking victims in respect of this law, says NBC.
The full name of the accuser in this case of the American Civil Liberities Union made in August about the unstated national legislation.
She said that her fellow "side her violent friends ’ sons," she abused her but the American authorities denied her request for protection on July 20.
He spent time in solitary confinement in Texas
Representatives of the federal sectors that give Grace support to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are the most important sources of security in America, such as areas facing serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
This new policy on the quest for safety in America brings with it the decision of 2014 by a refugee board that allowed refugees to flee from domestic violence to find safety.
Columbia General Karl Racine reported on Friday that this new legislation "rejects old, state, national and international legislation."
"The National Legislation requires that all requests for asylum be considered in terms of the request, and this legislation ends it," says the court counsel.
The lawyers also say that this law preventing refugees from entering America is damaging the American economy, that they may be able to become a businessman and perform necessary services.
General General Jeff Sessions issued a law to the judges that refugees should be given protection if they escape domestic violence or gang violence and are removed in June.
"Security is to be found for any who has left home because of persecution or because they are concerned about race, religion, or political feeling," said Svens on June 11.
Security has not been made for the purpose of facing all problems - I say the difficult ones -- people face them daily throughout the world.

A representative of the American country accused China of ‘ exploiting ’ using ‘ false ads'
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published a four - page advertisement for American - China trade, an American representative in China accused the country of using American news services to spread lies.
American statesman Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke about a Chinese daily advertisement in Des Moines Register - the supremely selling newspaper Iowa - stop for its purpose of undermining China’s dedication on November 6, which is an indictment of China.
Trump’s charge that China is trying to interfere with the election is what American officials tell Reuters that a new part of the ongoing campaign to bring pressure into China.
While it is common for governments of various countries to install commercials to promote trade, China and America are currently competing for trade and increasing costs.
China adds prices back at the start of the trade crisis and is designed to affect foreign stock dealers in government orders, such as the Iowa who support the Republican Trump team, say experts in China and America.
Terry Branstad, an American representative in China and the ancient governor of Iowa, who sells China most of the food crops, said that China has damaged American employees, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad writes his opinion on the Des Moines Register, "is now determined to exploit us by putting false ads in our free press.
"When spreading false news, the Chinese government puts himself at risk of hearing America using its usual custom of free speech and free publicity and advertising establishment in Des Moines Register," writes Brandon.
"In contrast, in the news media here at Beijing when you go down the street, you will find little different opinions and will never see how the Chinese think of the economic progress in China, we think the newsmen are under the Chinese Communist party, writing.
He added that the "one of the common cold newspapers has denied his request to publish this article" no matter where the newspaper is located.
The Republicans chased the homeless before the election of the committee against Kavanough’s problem, warning the analysts
Like the Republicans in high station next to the High Court’s hostage Brett Kavanaugh and to protect him from his accusations, of sexual abuse, analysts say they will see the wrong flow, especially on the people round about, in this future election of the first half century.
The feelings of this situation have been overwhelming, and the Republicans are again saying that they want to continue the election.
These things you can't go back," says Grant Reeher, a university professor of physics at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, telling The Hill when an article was published Saturday.
Reeher points out that the final attempts of the last time were made by Jeff Flake (R-Arina) to start the FBI research if they would change the opinion of angry votes.
"Conscientious people will not soon forget what happened tomorrow - will not be tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior adviser and public speaker of the advancing sector Moveon on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters also said, "Come on November!" walking on the carpet corridor as the Republicans governed the Justice Committee and decided to continue the kidnapping of Kananough despite the evidence of the doctor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"Love of liberty and the appeal of art is great," says Stutu Rothenberg, the neutral critic, informing the news agency.
"People have begun to say that you are older now, this is true.
But it can be much more, especially for people who have not yet made a decision about who will vote and who are new, 18-29-year-old, who, although not inclined to the president but not normally vote.
Even before Ford’s evidence was in the community that explained his charges against the High Court of Sexual Abuse, analysts say that it could have a negative effect on the Republicans ’ demands for assurance.
"This has become a problem with the GOP," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republic National Committee last week at the beginning, according to the NBC News.
"It doesn't matter whether the committee's own vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh enters the station, as well as how the Republicans are handling the situation and how they are treated," points out Guy Cecil in this news center, the administrator of Pretorias USA, a team that assists the Democrats to select the Democrats.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have little understanding of whom they can believe between the evidence of Ford and Kavanough, although there are few others who take part in the latter.
The 41 percent who participated in one survey showed that they probably believe or fully believe the proof of Ford, while 35 percent indicated that they might believe it either completely or fully believe in the case of Kavanough.
In addition, 38 percent thought that Kavanough is likely to be seasoning up to the fact that he was lying when he gave a witness, at the same time only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake’s interest, the FBI investigates the charges brought by Ford and another slanderer, Deborah Ramires, says The Guardian.
Ford silent of the statements made before the justice committee that last week Kavanough had abused her in 18 sexual terms when she was drunk by Kavanuagh
Ramirez accuses that the hostage of the Supreme Court revealed his private parts to him when they went into a party while they were studying in Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
The Internet director made plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners- Lee, the Internet producer, starts a new business with the aim of competing with Facebook, the Amazon and Google.
This technological device has a new Inrupt system, a business that produces Solid a system available to everyone.
The Solid allows its users to select the details in which to preserve them and who are authorized to see the details.
In an interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee has discussed the purpose of Inrupt as "the Control of the World."
"We have to do it now," speaking of this business.

This technology entry allows humans to create a "survival" or PED.
It can include a list of telephone numbers, a list of things you must do, a calendar, your music, and other personal and work activities.
It's similar that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify are in the same place at the same time.
Different from this storage area is the choice of the user as to what one can see.
The company calls it "a personal and personal-equipped."
Inrupt, according to chief executive John Bruce, to bring in weapons, systems and similar skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a process purchased by IBM, personnel who promote this process and the society of volunteer manufacturers.
Since this week, the world’s technology industry has been able to develop a single system that they have developed through the use of the Internet.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team spoke "Facerbook and Goodle about to produce major changes that would make their business stop at once.
‘ We will not ask their permission. ’
"Berers-Lee wrote to Medium on Saturday that the purpose of Inrupt's "to provide an interest in businesses and places which will help to protect the integrity and the quality of the new Solid Internet."
In 1994, Berners- Lee changed the Internet while creating the World Wide Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners- Lee has been an influential voice in this case of Internet neutrality.
Even when officially opened Inrupt, Bernard-Lee will still be the creator and administrator of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Center and Open Data Center.
"I’m happy over this new Internet section," adds Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victoria Cross instructor at WW1
The first and last week to receive Victoria Cross during World War II.
Lt. Col. Cardinal Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 during the assault at Ballingise and Lehaucourt.
Nevertheless, he was killed by a long - range cat strikeer and died unaware that in four days he would receive the highest prize in Britain.
A memorial stone was opened by two of his grandchildren in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the stone’s discovery is not easily forgotten because it was revealed 100 years after his grandfather received the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 L. Col. Vann paid his men under him to pass through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "a heavy fog and were fired with large guns and machine guns.
Later he fled to those shootings and bravely took the big guns and machine guns alone.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German who carried a hand of a cat shooting away on October 4 1918 - more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, says that his grandfather's actions are "an evil that he knows he'll never be able to do, but he said it's humble."
He and his brother Dr James Vann recorded a history made a circle after the Brenwood Imperial Youth Ben.
Michael Vann says that he feels "respectable as he has been a part of the march" and adds that "the courage of the true hero will be displayed by many people who give support."

Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley feels ‘ little ’ because of his sex
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he has grown younger because of his physical character - bearing condition, but he has been interested in his success.
This 24-year-old man says I have seen from the second grade that I am ‘ not like other people. ’
Commenting on the first procedure of the Desert Island Discs run by Lauren Laverne in Radio 4, he says that he mentioned the rights of homosexual people to give them "hope."
He has led him into losing his battle against the Olympics.
The familiar guide of this program, Kirsty Young, has heard about the months of illness.
To appear as a thrower at Laverne's first conference, Dley says she felt like the youngest when she grew up because "it was not allowed to love the girls."
He said: "Until this day, feelings of feeling small and different are my main interest and the ability to succeed. ”
She wanted to prove herself ‘ something, ’ she said, so that she wouldn't embarrass everyone if they found out about her sex status.
This winner who has defeated the two Olympic medals has worked publicly with the LGBT and has used his reputation this year for the Commonweal Games in Australia to ask for more countries to make stability.
She said that she felt she was fortunate to be able to live without having to face problems and want to give others "hope."
This world Conqueror, who fell in love with a man - an American film producer in 2013 - is not expected.
Dale has married this Oscar victory, older than she in the last 20 years, but she says that the gap in which they took each other was not trouble.
"When you face such things as a young" - you go to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died from cancer three years after that — he says it was difficult to find a person of the same age who faces the same life problems.
The couple became parents in June, find a boy whom they named Robert Ray Black-Galey, and Dayy says "all his ideas" have changed.
"If you asked me this past year, I would tell you that I need to ‘ get a gold medal, ’ he said.
"You know, there are great things to finish the Olympic gold rods.
My gold medal Robbie.
Her son has the same name as her father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the doctors first diagnosed brain cancer.
During one of his final comments, Daley asked if they had any tickets from London in 2012 - because he wanted to live.
"I couldn't say ‘ you won't be in the front seats," he says.
"I would hold her in my hand when she finished breathing and saw that she could not breathe again," he said.
The following year Stanley competed in the 2012 Olympics and received a copper medal.
‘ I could see that this was what I had always dreamed of — splashing in the water before the multitudes in the Olympic game, I could not feel any better, ’ he says.
She was also interested in saying her first proud, a prod - so - that she was always interested in the champion and frightened by him.
The Desert Island Discs is discovered in BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is put in a battery in the Ryder Cup game on Saturday.
Mel Mickelson will make a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game but has to change his performance so as not to make this unpleasant record.
Mickelson, who plays this twice a year for the 12th year, is put on the band by Captain Jim Furyk in 4 football games with 4 people.
Instead of being watched by the crowds, as is the custom in playing America, this winner of the five victories spent half of his day without playing and then trained to correct problems.
Although he is not able to play the game accurately, the 48 - year - old player is not well qualified to play in the Le Golf National, where the grass is available and is difficult to find.
If the playing field itself is frightening, Mickelson, at the ninth of Sunday, faces the best - known Frenchco Molinari of the British Open, who has collaborated with student Tommy Fleetwood to win all their games in the weekend.
If the Americans, less than 4 points. If they can properly start 12 alone games, Mickelson's game is more important than that.
Furryk expressed his confidence in her husband as expected.
"He fully understood his role today, beat me a little back and thrust his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,"
"Real self- confidence."
You have found a famous hall site and have added much to these groups in the past time, and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought you would play more games, but they did not go the way we thought they would.
He wants people to know him, like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo’s record of many sports in the Ryder Cup game.
He can decide his play in the Ryder Cup that is unlike his personal record.
He has won 18 times, was defeated 20 times, and had some serious doubts, since Fulyk said that his presence brought out unseen things in this group.
"You're funny, humory, quick to respond, funny to people, and a good person to be with you in the club room" to explain.
"I was surprised to see young players laughing at him in this week was happy to see that."
It offers only the least of the fun."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that speed may be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European bishop, knows that the lead position may soon be lost as this group is ahead of the Ryder Cup but can change at any time.
This colour started to play in Valderma in 1997, where the case paid by the Seven Balles was five points ahead of America, but it was buried in the latter, in the year 1.11⁄2-131–2.2.2.2.
"You will tell yourself that you have many articles in Valderma; you have many points in Brookline, where they are conducted and Valderma, where we won, hard," by Bjorn, pictured, after viewing the 2010-5-3 on Friday and the last in points 10-6 Le Golf National.
Therefore history will teach me and everyone in this group, if this is not yet done.
We will give out all that we have in the future
We will do all we should.
This is not yet complete until the notes on the board.
We have a goal, and it is an effort to overcome it when it is aimed at us.
Once again, I'm focusing on the 12 performers on my side, but we know who is facing any of the other players in the rest of the world."
Excited by the way his players played in this difficult game, Bjor added: "I never really thought of this.
The next day we speak about something different.
In the morning the individual play skills are checked, and that is not the same.
It is rare to have a partner here when things go well for you, but when you are alone, you first have your strength tested like a golf club.
It is the message that is forced upon you by all the players, who are expected to display it tomorrow.
Now, you don't come with your partner, you have to prove yourself again.
Unlike Bjorn, man Jim Furyk on the other side is looking for his players to play well alone and not as a team, except Jordan Apeith and Justin Thomas, who receive three to four paragraphs.
Fulyk was once the two sides of the last day's revolutions, she was on the side of Brookline when she was defeated as Europe did the "miracle at Medinah."
"I remember everything he said," in reply, being Ben Crenshaw the Captain of 1999, how he impressed them when they were going to the last day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but we don't have to think that in mind as you saw it in Brookline and Medinah.
When you start winning every time you start, it puts pressure on the ball game.
We organize our players in order and put them in a way that will have a good effect, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned to pay for the war return and face Rory McIlroy in the upper play, facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulterhu at the upper quarters.
"I go with this group of men with this schedule because I think they seem to be going through everything," says Bjorn in this choice of individuals.
The German warship has been launched again.
A new German ship should be launched in 2014 to enter the position of warships known as the Cord War, but the following year it will not be released because of problems and costs, says the news officer.
The release of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," a passenger ship produced by Baden-Wuttermberg-class Frigates, was postponed by the first half of 1990, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, the spokesman for the army.
The ship should not have joined the navy by 104, but the arrival of the cargo has done so.
The four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg in 2007 and will replace Bremen ships.
It was known that there would be a powerful weapon, as well as weapons of fire and aircraft and other technologies that made it invisible to Radar, infrared and accustics.
Also important if it takes a long time before it needs repair - it can go on for two years away from home.
However, ongoing disturbances make these new ships - which are said to give German power across-ships out of time when launched.
This naval vessel was launched in the news last year, while the German navy officially refused to release the ship back to Broom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was for the first time the navy returned the ship to the ship's founder after it was launched.
There is little known about the reasons for the ship’s being refitted, but German news reporters say that there have been "ships and goods" making the ship a good operation, which has made the ship useless in the war.
The machinery is much more efficient as the Bade-Wuerttemberg ships are used by 120 persons and half of the people forced to use the old Bremen.
Also, it appears that the ship is too heavy to reduce her ability and that the navy will not be able to improve in the future.
This 7,000-toned vessel, "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to survive two times more than such ships were used by the Germans during the second world war.
Despite goods that do not work, the costs of all this work - plus the educational costs of the employees to use it are now beginning to become a problem.
It is said to have reached about £3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from %.2 billion.2 billion
The problems of new ships are important when it is shown that the strength of the German Navy is decreasing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Security Committee, admitted that the navy is ‘ losing the warship'.
The officer says that the problem has grown older as the years have gone by, since older ships were discharged from the fleet but no new ones were installed.
He then said that no other ship in Baden-Wuerttemberg was able to join the navy.
The New Trust proclaims stories of flying creatures such as storks
A new encyclopedia in the Scottish Highlands wants to explain how these animals use their environment to obtain food.
It is hoped that the results will enlighten us about the way these animals behave and how they can be protected.
This is the astrolabe made by Scottish National Trust scientists, who will follow these familiar animals, which make the sound of the soprano, with long ears and the Daubentons of the Invewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording machines will be placed in important positions in this area to indicate what they are doing during the year.
NHS’s staff and volunteer workers will make recordings of their portable machine.
Sound experts will check the records to show their calls and what this type of behavior does.
A map of these remains and a report will be made to show the animals how they conduct themselves.
Rob Dewar, an environmental safety adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will be that the sight of these animals will be of their favorite location and of any other types used.
These information will help us to see what benefits are gained from protecting wildlife habitats and how we can conserve wildlife.
The presence of animals in Scotland and UK has declined a hundred years ago.
They are at risk for the construction and development of habitats.
Air pressure and light can put the animals at risk as well as flying newspapers and chemicals from buildings, as well as assault cats.
These creatures are invisible.
Even so, most of their daily appetites are more frequent than their eyes when it comes to catching food.
They find their food in the heat of the moment when they come to their ears to see what they are eating or what prevents them from flying.
The NTS, responsible for over 270 old places, 38 important gardens and 66,000 acres [6,000 ha] of land in the country, assumes that these animals are important.
It consists of ten trained professionals, making residuals, surveying their living quarters, and sometimes rescues.
The center has created an exhibit in Scotland only in Threave on Dumfries and Galloway, with eight species of animals
The head of the area, David Thompson, says this is the right place for them.
"Here in Threave we have a beautiful place for these animals," says.
"We have old spaces, old trees and a good living place.
There is much that no human can know about animals, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us explain what they need to live.
He says that the value of research on these animals before you take care of the area is important, since the habitat of the children of animals could be lost in a siege area of 400 children, which could cover all such factors.
The animals are safe and illegal in suicide, which he places on them and their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Bat Conservation Trust of Scotland, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "There is still much to know about these animals and the many species we don't know about.
Ronalo refutes false charges of sedition and will destroy a German magazine
Cristina Rolando has named the rape charges as false, claiming that people want to make a name for themselves.
His attorneys will launch the German news service Der Spiegel, which is responsible for the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus sextant, named Kathryn Mayorga, was accused of rape at a hotel in 2009
Then, it is said, he spent $3375,000 not to say anything about the event, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking of the Instagram which spread to his 142 million followers after just a few hours of the charges were made, Ronaldo, 33 years old, dismissed himself as "false."
"No, not, but, only, not, but, not.
What they say today, a lie, the winner of the Ballon d'Or five times that comes to the camera.
"They want to make known to men on the basis of my name.
It is not unusual.
They want to be identified by my name, but that’s all too common now.
I am happy and ready," the player added, laughing.
Ronalo's attorneys are ready to launch the Der Spiegel on these charges, which are "an unconventional reporting of claims on personal life," according to Reuters.
Prosecutor Christian Schertz says that this player needs to be let go of "the spiritual damage resulting from the abuse of personal rights in past years."
The event is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a hotel called Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a drinking club, Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have taken to the playroom, where they rape him back, by paper posted at the Clark County Center in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and was "a good man" "99 percent" is the problem by the majority of the same.
According to the agreement, Ronaldo made sure that the couple were together, but they agreed.
Mayorga said that she went to the police and took pictures of their injuries in the hospital, but later they agreed to talk to each other out of the courts because she was afraid she would return and worried of being humiliated.
The 34 - year - old says that he now wants them to go back because what he says Ronalddo is still painful.
Ronaldo was about to intervene in the Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the charge, and this summer he went to the large Italian group Juventures for the sale of £100 million.
Brexit: UK will ‘ regret it forever ’ for losing car manufacturers.
The UK will always regret it. If it loses its leading role in producing motor vehicles after Brexit, says electronic secretary Greg Clark.
Add to this concern that Toyota in the UK has told the BBC that Britain can walk through the EU in a dialogue will stand a little longer to produce in their company at Burkinaston, near Derby.
"We need a combination," says Mr. Clark.
This car manufacturer from Japan has expressed the threat of slowing the flow of clothing off the border if no connections to Brexit will complete the work.
The Burnaston - producing Toyota Auris and Asnsis – has produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90 percent of the eye is exported to the European Union.
"My risk is that if Britain travels in the EU at the end of Mash, we will see an alarm stop in our production," says Marvin Cooke, the administrator of the Toyota in Burkiston.
Some UK manufacturers have expressed their fear of traveling the EU without the combination of trade, including Honda, BW and the Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will close its day output at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Serious anxiety about this can also pose a risk to trade when there is no connection in Brexit.
The Toyota screen is run by the "time" system, with motor goods arriving every 37 minutes from sales from the UK and the EU for the purpose of producing cars at once.
And while the UK travels in the EU without any combination on 29 March, there may be an disruption to the extent that the business can be delayed and insufficient clothing.
Toyota will never have enough clothes for her day in Derbyshire, the business, and the crop will stop.
Sir Clark said that the Theresa May plan with the EU "is designed to avoid this problem on the border.
"We need a combination. We need a very good combination that will allow us to take this opportunity," tells Radio 4 of BBC on the application called Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other producers explains that we need to continue where we have been through the most effective development."
Toyota has not seen how long the drills become dry, and has been in a long period of time warning that increased prices will reduce competition ability in time.
Peter Tsoullāris, who has worked for Burma for 24 years and has assumed the Uniting Union in this project that they are about to worry again. "The time I have spent in my service I know I will never return"
A government spokesman says: "Tell us a reliable plan for future cooperation with the EU.
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed, says the American president’s office
The important Dalald Trump conference and the general adviser Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for another week as was when the election of the high court Brett Kavanaugh continued, says the president.
Rosenstein undertook the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who conducted a survey of Russia’s election, as well as the convention between the Trumps and Russia and the disruption of the legal arm by the president
The fact that Trump puts other off does not expel the general lawyer, endangering Mueller’s independence, has been the cause of much gossip in Washington during the past months
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein said that he would wear a recording recording with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by mold 25
Rosenstein protested this statement.
But on the last day he went to the White House House House, among the reports he would proceed.
rather, meetings together
Trump said that he would not ‘ choose ’ Royente, but the conference was delayed to avoid a confrontation in the Committee of the Committee hearing where Kavanough and one of the sexually charged adolescents, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both have witnessed.
On Friday, Tump has approved a single  fulfiller of the FBI's investigations against Kavanaugh, which has further called for the complete Senate's vote.
Trump news writer, Nsz Sarah Sanders, appeared in the Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein conference, he said: "The day if it was not used, otherwise this week, I saw that the next week is given all other things that happened in the high court.
But we'll see and always like to keep thepress updated.
Some scholars argue against this: The Sanders did not drive the White House line from 10 September.
Chris Wallace asked why.
And Sanders said that the absence of arguments was not due to the disturbances of the TV merchants "great," although he said: "I would not agree to look."
He suggested that a contact be directly between the Trump and the flu lift.
"The president has made Q&A sessions and sessions rather than any president before," he has added without counting the evidence: "We look at those numbers.
Reports are going to take place, Sanders said, but "If the printer has the opportunity to ask the president of America directly, it is better to talk to me.
We try to do so and have seen him do lots of things in the last few weeks and will take the place of the printing statement when you speak with the U.S. president.
Trump always asks questions when leaving a White House or participating in open sessions or connecting meetings with portable sentences.
Solo news conferences are a disaster.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, he made a freeheeling and certain invisible periods before meeting the news.
The Health Secretary writes to the EU personnel in NHS Scotland about Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written the EU from Scotland to NHS to express their thankfulness to the country and wish to stay in Post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP has sent a letter less than six months to the UK off the EU.
The Scottish government has dedicated itself to meeting the expenses of the EU environment applications for public service.
In his letter, Mrsz Freeman wrote: "During this summer, the conversations between the UK and the EU in departure have continued, focusing on the expected decisions in the autumn.
But the UK State has compiled its plans for an impossible situation.
I know this should be a very disturbing experience for all.
That is why I want to regain my appreciation for the contribution made to the whole crew, regardless of the country.
The brothers from all over the EU, and above, bring out the important experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service, and benefit the patients and the community we are using.
The Skotland is your living place and we want you to stay here. "

Additional receivables will be paid when they buy a UK property
The foreign buyers will be paid when they buy the UK property and extra funds used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
The rise will reduce the Corbyn success of the Corbyn driving to attract young votes.
The increase in station work will be paid to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Fund expected to rise to £ 120 million a year to help the homeless.
Salesmen of other trades are used to pay for high levels of familial work for UK - plus additional services for the homeless, Theresa May will bring them today.
The rise will appear to be an attempt to reduce the success of Jeremy Corbyn's Dr.
The increase in unit work will be paid for by individuals and non-payable UK tax firms, as well as additional funds for improving Russia's battle-fleet against sleeping.
The extra fee for the current work of the camps, including the high levels placed in two previous years in two homes and the purchase of rent, may be about 30 percent.
The Fund is expected to raise to £ 120 million annually.
13 per cent of new buildings built in London are purchased by the UK population, conducting costs and making it difficult for the first buyers to find foot at the level of houses.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially capital - have become the "home" because of the high number of foreign customers who spend their time in this country.
The new policy comes after weeks after Boris Johnson has asked that the stamp be set up for the benefit of new home-owners.
He persecutes large firms in the construction of the maintenance of a high property by removing the land but not using it, and urged Mrsz May to put up platforms in the purchase homes so as to correct the British 'house scandal'.
Sir Corbyn has published a list of proposed restorers, including control of rent and discharge.
He also wants to provide many huge committees to build new homes.
Msz May said: "Last year I said I was going to give your premiership back to the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means repairing our real - estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to stay, work, and build life here.
Even so, it is not advisable to make it easy for UK blind people, as well as for outside companies, to buy homes as hard - working British citizens.
For most people the dream of homeowners has been too far away, and the destruction of a painful sleep remains very real. "
Jack Ross: 'My upper breast is controlling Scotland'
The Sunderland Officer Jack Ross says that the "his high desire" is to be the Captain of Scotland at a certain stage.
Scotts, 42, explains the challenge of restoring the North-east club, now occupys the third position in the League One, three stand up.
She moved to the Stadium of Light on this stage after leading St Mirren to the Premiership of Scottish Season.
I want to play my country like a player.
I have B bulls and this, "Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Henden too much and even as a child, and it remains my protection.
That opportunity will come, however, if I succeed in the club control.
Ross chief executive of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio
The former general of Alloa Atletic says that he did not have the courage to follow the lengthy terms in a large club, which had already discarded parts from Barnsley and Ipswich City.
"The success of me during this time will be followed" Can I restore this verb to the Prince of the League?'
As a result of the building and facilities in this game, no doubt in the Premier League, he said so.
"It's not easy to find there, but I'll probably look for a success here to return to the group.
Ross for only three years in his handling course, after time as an assistant to Dumbarton and 15 days in Coachingstaff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the third entry, and changed St Mirren from the level of support in the Championship level in the following phase.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than he had when playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"It was possible to be real," in memory, by taking Alloa.
"I really believe that the rule is good for me, more than to play.
It sounds so good because I did well, made a good life for it, and enjoyed a high level.
But play can be a real challenge.
There are many things that you have to do each week.
I continue that way in terms of the stresses and pressures of the work, but the control feels correct.
I always wanted to be in control, and now I do that, feeling that I am free to be in my bag for the rest of my life. "

The type of heathwave has encouraged the removal of heavy British bridges but more concentrated in eating stores.
Pub and the bar see the sale of 2.7 percent by July - but taking from meals is less than 4.8 percent, displayed in the number.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy bilisity CGA, which included these figures, said: "The long continuance of the sun with England rather than you are expected to participate in the World Crucial C, follows the same example in the past year June, when the pubs rise by 2.8 percent, unless the restaurants are hard.
The 1.8 percent falling from the trading store in June increased dramatically in July.
Drinking bottles and overexposures are more like a taste for more than a low - cost restaurant.
Eating - headed pubs were also destroyed by the sun, although they are not as much as diners.
It seems that people want to get out of a drink.
In all the rubs handled and drinking bars were over 6.6 percent of the month, with 3 per cent of food.
Paul Newman, social analysts and guests, RSM says: "These effects continue with the wind we have seen since April.
The weather and the effects of major social or sports matters are always the most important when it comes to exporting in the outer market.
Not surprisingly, shopping groups continue to fight, although a 4.8 percent increase in sales worldwide will be particularly painful at the cost of ongoing costs.
A long-smoker type will not come at a very critical time for the propellers leading to food and time will mean that the temperature taken in August will give more breathing.
The general increase in pubs and stores, including the new reception, was 2.7 percent by July, showing the improvement of the brush outs.
The Coffer Peach Traceer of the UK Pub, bar and food-rekolant unit's food unit collects and checks of working data from 47 working groups, and combined prices over £mu-9 million, and a set medical model.
One of five students who have hidden confidential radio accounts from their parents
One of five children - others, such as three children with private records that hide from their parents and teachers, surveys show
The research of 20,000 high school students has indicated the growth of the "False Insta" pages.
News has raised the likelihood that sex is suspended in the channels
Twenty percent of students say they have the "head account" to show their parents
One of five children - others like 11 minors - create social news accounts that keep a secret to adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students has indicated rapid growth in the "Instake Insta" account" - referring to the Instagogram state.
The news media have raised fears that the sex theme is being sent.
Twenty percent of the students said they are running a "particular" account for showing parents, when they are alone.
One mother who was upset at her 13-year-old daughter found a girl who moved others to "take me away."
The research, with the Digital Aharreness UK and the Headhead (HMC) of the independent schools, found 40 percent of children 11 to 18 years of age, with two records, and half of those who agreed to keep their accounts.
Prince of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: ‘ It is disturbing that many new people are tempted to create Internet sites where parents and teachers cannot find them.'

An apocrypha declaration by comparing mothers with cows to an Internet opinion
The pump company has divided the image of the Internet market and the announcement that describes young mothers in captivity.
To highlight the creation of so-called "the first bomb," the Elvie company has released the theme of sic-in-cheek inspired video video to show the new freedom pump gives publicity to mothers.
Four mothers have a dance in the new bar of cattle on the trails that include sounds like: "Yes, I don't, but don't see tail" and "If you haven't noticed these things, you don't."
Chorus continues: "Pmp it out, pump it out, I feed the dog, pump it, pump it, pump it, and put my girls in."
Nevertheless, an advertisement, printed on a file film, creates an online conflict.
In terms of 77,000 and hundreds of millions of articles, the video has received mixed answers from viewers, many say that it means "disease" in the milk industry.
"A suitable solution is used by cattle to announce this product.
As if they have to become pregnant and nurse to produce milk, unless their babies are introduced to them before the days of childbirth, "printing one.
Elvie's chest gun corresponds closely to the inside of a storage container (Elvie / mother)
Another said: “An obvious concern is to mother and child.
But really, why not use it to publish a pump pump to mothers who will keep their children?
Another person added: "Invasion to the sale."
Some protect the declaration, one woman admits to having received a "Pure" song.
‘ I think this is human theory.
I shall be alone, that I may yet fill them.
It made me feel like a bull.
The announcement was a little painful, but I took it.
This is a brain product, one written.
Another said: "This is a sweet advertisement directed to mother pumping (usually in their workshops or toilets) and feels like ‘ cow'.
This is not an advertisement that glorifies or condemns the milk industry.
At the end of the video, a group of participants indicated that they were all playing with distress pumps.
The theme behind the campaign is based on the thought that many well - known women feel like cattle.
Elvie Pmp, therefore completely silent, no wire or bulbs and closely conforms to the inside of the shroud bridge, granting women freedom to walk, hold their children, and go out.
Ana Bararin, an ECD equivalent to Mother, said: "Elvie’s breath is such a evolutionary product which was appropriate to the development of the liver.
By showing the similarity between women and milk cows we wanted to place breast - feeding with all the physical obstacles, while reflecting on the fun and appearance of the mindless freedom that will bring.
This is not the first Elvie pump to trigger.
During the Mondon week, the mother of two children appeared in the assigningk Martha Jaboowski's political party while using this product.
More and more River people are busy in the Texas Borders Camp
The number of children used to migrate has gone out even though the travel of the moon remains constant, thanks to the division that the heavy control and control systems of the Trump system make it difficult to keep children and support.
Traditionally, many of the support groups have become foreign, and they have threatened their ability to stay in the country by furthering the call of the child.
The risk increased by June, when the government authorities announced that the patrons and other older members of their homes should wear fingerprints, and if the date should be shared with the authorities.
Last week, Mateu Albence, the senior Executive Officer and the Space Revolution, testified before the Conference that the attorney holds large numbers of people who applied for the support of children who are not involved.
The attorney later made sure that 70 percent were arrested and that they had no record of crimes.
"Almost 80 percent of the people are of particular support or family members who do not support the country illegally, and a large funk of these foreign offenders.
So we continue to pursue such people, says Mr. Alberce.
To make rapid progress to the children, the officers are promising new laws that will require that others appear in court over the internment month, not long after 60 days, be the last requirement, with regard to the local staff.
Many will appear in a telephone conference, rather than join a person, to defend their legal position in a immigration judge.
Those considered unworthy of freedom will soon be removed.
After a long time for children to stay in a cell, they may say that they can be anxious or depressed, which can lead to the end or to escape, according to travel personnel and reports that have appeared in the system in the months to come.
Supporters claim that this concern is raised in a large institution such as Tornillo, where the child’s difficult symptoms may be forced, because of its size.
They added that taking children to a tent town without providing enough time to prepare themselves physically or to say that friends could pick up much of the damage they suffered with them.
Syria tells the US, French and Turkish that it is rapidly dependent
In view of the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called the Syrians to come home, although the war is now the eighth year.
Moulem, also serving as prime minister, has declared the outside army of Syria illegally, under the thought of fighting and cruelty, and "it will be properly taken."
"They have to chase quickly and without order," said the company.
Moulem stressed that the "War of event is raging" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died in 2011, as well as millions of other people were displaced from their homes.
He says Damascus will continue to fight this sacred battle until we complete the rest of Syria"
The United States has 2,000 armed forces in Syria, generally for training and counseling troops of Kurdish and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 wars in the world in a war - torn country
In a refugee event, Moulem stated that these conditions were suitable for her return, and she said that "some Western countries" because of spreading the irrational fear that sent refugees to stay far away.
"We have called the international sectors and communities for this payment," he said.
"They called out what should be the concern of the people."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no restructuring in Syria until there is a political concordat between Assad and opposition to the end of the war.
UN combinations say that the newly signed agreement between Russia and Turkey is established at the level of the Tampun's main Idlébite tower has given opportunity to further political claims.
The Russian - Turkish language launched a fierce attack on the Russian people of war, where three million people live.
Moulem but stressed that the treaty "has been a long time" and has expressed the hope that the participants of the war will aim at the jadistants as well as the All-Qaeda-in connection with the Nusra Front, "to be destroyed."
UN delegate Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon join the first conferences of a new committee organized by government members and opposition to form a Syrian military constitution and to provide a choice route.
The Moualem set up conditions for the Syrian State’s acting on the committee, saying that the functions of the parliament should be prevented from "renewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against disturbance.
Why would Trump succeed in second quarter
In that sense, Mr. Trump will succeed in the selection of 2020 unless, most liberal viewers probably have hope, deviations and curses that end his president in time.

From now on, there are no signs of the caregiver’s fatigue.
Since 2014, the average time value of normal time has doubled in 0.05 million in the CNN and nearly three to 1.6 million in the MSNBC.

It is not surprising that 17 Pennsylvanias see a flood of expenditure, thanks to the transition of inter-connected cases in the affected areas of the same seat.
A region recently destroyed in the town of Pittsburgh recently reached the Democratic Rep.
The Lamb works against another authorized person, Republic Keith Rothfus, currently representing the Pennsylvania district of 12, which carries 17th more.
The maps were raised after the Pennsylvania High Court had judicial decisions in January if the old provinces were not under the constitution of the Republic.
The new competition in 17 has prevented the financial struggle between the major commissions, the Democratic Committee of the Community Committee (DCCC) and the National Council of the Republic of Cultural Affairs (NRCC).
The Lamb became a common name in Pennsylvania after a small visitor by a special March 18 of the Central District District in Pennsylvania.
This seat was held by Ribubchki for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district 20 degrees.

U.S. Offset Penaling El Salvador With Chinese Support, after which it was supported
The Diplomats say that the Rominican Republic and Panama have chosen Beijing, not to leave Washington.
Mr Trump had a delightful meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until a companion released the Trump Organization.
Officials of the State Department have decided to restore the American delegates from El Salvador, the Romanian Republic, and Panama about "the last decision to be destroyed soon to be able to see Taiwan," says Heather Nauert, who speaks for the Department, at the synod this month.
But the sentences were considered only for El Salvador, which earned $33 million of American AIDS in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
Premises, which include the provision of financial support and the defunct prohibitions aimed at it, would be painful for the North American country and for the lack of high jobs and rates of murder.
As the medieval meetings progressed, the officers of North America and North America put off a high conference aimed at security and economic development following the same conference last year that was seen as a major step in preventing migrants from going to the United States.
But in mid - September, the authorities of the higher authority explained that they wanted the conference to continue, completely eliminating any consideration of El Salvador's judgments.
The Vice-President Mike Perce is now prepared to handle the conference, now arranged in October, in symbol of the entry of control positions at this conference.
And these three Americans automatically sent to El Salvador, Panama and the Roman Republic without heavy messages or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the conversation discussed by three American officers, including two combinations, which agreed to discuss internal arguments in unknown situations.
Their reports were backed up by an out-of-archy and spoke about unknown circumstances.
Reading history
The following point to drop would be Robert Mueller’s special counsel in the report Mr Trump, where there is much evidence in public information.
Mr Mueller is said to have answered his research and that Mr. Trump is linked with Russia in its attack of our election.
If Congres will change the hands, Mr. Trump will find himself under a burden in that body, as you are prepared to go back to the pollster, perhaps finally to judge his peers.
This is too much, and I don't like to show that Sir Trump is inevitable or unconventional in Europe.
There is a choice for our action on both sides of the Atlantic to prevent the length of the long struggle.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to direct the Hitler, if only the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakias in Munich.
We have won a victory, and we have lost the opportunity to avoid years of murder.
The course of history revolves about such points, and a democracy that cannot be supported quickly becomes hasty or slow.
The Americans are facing articles that are revealing now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump's Master-General Rod Rosenstein, man in charge of Sir Mueller's Future of Inquiry?
The Rosenstein is in the hot water since this paper that, last year, he was secretly advised to write to the president and express himself incorrectly in the office.
Mr Rosenstein says the Times account is not valid.
"What will we do when a recent investigation request for FB.I. A Brett Kavanaugh does not keep or should it be proved in the Supreme Court despite the sincere accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote between the applets that will hold Mr. Trump?
If we pass the test, the democracy will be in the long winter.
But I am convinced that it will not pass away, thanks to the lesson I read in Prague.

Government prosecutors seek a rare NYC death sentence
New York prosecutors sought a death sentence on St. Saipov, a New York City accused of a courageous attack that killed eight persons in a strange form of punishment that had not been committed during police crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, says that he was using Loto Dotto to hire Home for a ride along the West Side Highway on South Manhattan, to pay foot and bicycle on his route in October.
In order to condemn the death sentence, the persecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov purposely killed eight victims and "purpose" caused bodily injury, following notice for the death sentence, placed in Northern New York State.
Both served the death sentence, according to the court’s judgment.
For weeks after the attack, the jury Great jury struck Saipov with 22-count of accounting that included eight deaths in support of the integrity, commonly used by the medical killers in cases of crime, and the payment of crime and loss of transport.
The attacks had to be "closed with a lot of planning and practice," the prosecutors said, described how Saipov did it as "a cruel, cruel and true".
"Sayullo Habibullaev's Saifov caused injury, injury, and loss of family and friends of George Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Dieduch, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,'s announcement of objectives.

The last time the death sentence was executed in the New York court case in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple were executed after they were found guilty of taking possession of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenbergs were both killed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse for days and months after the attack, according to court records.
He told investigators that he felt good about the things he did, and the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to conduct the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, in cases.
She was asked to show an ISIS apartment in her hospital, said the police.
Coins-count is due.
David Patton, one of the authorities representing the Saviv, said that "there is obviously upset" in the prosecutor's decision.
"We think of the decision to receive a death sentence rather than accept a court sentence without a discharge which will increase the full time of the participation to all those affected," said Patton.
Saipov's safety team earlier asked the hunters to seek a death sentence.

President Donald Trump criticized Senator Dianne Feinstein for his insistence on not breaking the book from Christine Blasey Ford criticized the High Court’s decision for sexual assault.
Speaking at a conference in West Virginia, the president did not clearly mention the evidence provided by Foeyi before the Council of Courts, rather than focus on what happened in the Senate shows that the people were "speaking and stimulating and strong."
One thing that can happen and is the good thing going on in the last few days in Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are hot and talking and talking and talking and not talking, "You said it."
"When you check for discharge and leaks and say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do You Recall?
Did Dianne Feinstein, give you a champion?
Remember his answer ...
Oh not.
I never woke up.
Yes, wait a minute.
Are we equal to ... No, we didn't go out, "add, to a level of senator.
Feinstein sent a letter writing on the accounts of Kavanough by Fordon in July, and it was alive in early September - but Feinstein rarely that the leaks came from his office.
"I did not hide Dr. F Ford records, I did not close his story, "Feinstein told the committee, the Hill reported.
"He asked me if I held it secretly and kept it as secret as he asked.
But his denial did not seem to fit in with the president, who spoke about Saturday night: "I’m going to tell you, that was very bad.
Perhaps he did not, but it was the worst type of body I saw. "
To further protect the Supreme Court’s Committee, who is accused of sexual immorality by three women, the president explained that the Democracy is used for their judgments.
"They are determined to restore power in whatever way is needed.
Seeing the meaning, the injustice, the care of who is the wrongdoer, who must work to gain power and control, the "Mediaite shall tell the president.

Another black man?
NYNny sues second after shooting after the word "racial"
The New York nony tells the couple quoted after they received the wrong text from the mother who complains that she is a ‘ other black person.'
This couple disagrees that we are not partial, likening suit to "robbing."
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed concern when he discovered that the new child's service provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when he arrived on his first day of the service in 2016.
" NO LIGHT," wrote Mrsz Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the quotation.
Even so, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrsz Maurice, twice.
After realizing his geffe, the Plasco-Flaxman was dismissed by Nksz Maurice, whose outgoing nany, who was an American, had done a bad job and rather than expect a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Msz Maurice was paid for the project one day and returned home in Uber.
Now, Maurice corrects the couple for compensation, and he seeks compensation for $350 a day for six months, his first gig, if they are not in agreement.
"I want to show it, look, you don't do such things," he told the mail on Friday, adding, "I know I'm against it."
The couple had argued that they were racially prejudiced, saying that it was reasonable to resign from Maurice’s job, fearing that they could trust him only after they provoked him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't like to say.
He is not a nation.
They are not ethnic people, "Man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you not put your children into the hands of someone who had made haste, even though it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come."
Comparing a suit to "robbing," Plasco said his wife was only two months old if she had a child and she was "weight."
"You will follow such a man?
That is not the best thing to do, "the bank of the investment is added.
Although the case is still underway, the civil court has quickly looked for a couple quoted from the world’s diamonds, treating them with respect to their conduct and thoughts.
The publishers in Paddington were afraid that students did not fit in with the talker, a new publication showing
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, said: ‘ It is difficult to put it on the shoes of the person who reads for the first time before it is printed.
I am amazed now that we know about much success in Paddington. "
He said that his father, who served as BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's manual on a small Bible, would be a privileged man about his forbidden work, adding that the book had been a "after his death last year.
In Paddington, describing "the most important member of the family," added the father was automatically relying on his success.
"He was an adult, and was not a proud person," he said.
"But because Paddington was true to her, it was difficult for her to have a child to accomplish something: she is proud of herself, though not necessarily so.
I suppose he had observed Paddington’s success that way.
Although he was his creation and his opinion, he always owed him a debt to Paddington himself. "
My daughter was dying and I had to gossip over the telephone
There her daughter was rushed to a hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors were working in vain to save her life.
"UNad always called it wrong, if not expected to do it," said Mrsz Edna-Laperouse.
"After that I received a call from Nad that he said he would die between two minutes and I had to tell him.
And I am sick.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, I love you."
I will be with you soon.
I’ll be with you.
Her doctor had given her the strength to keep her heart beating faster and had abandoned her system.
He had a short time before his hand was over, and the whole thing was shut down.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all of that would come.
I could not cry or cry or cry because I was put in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold together.
Finally Sir Edna-Laperouse, now tragically lost her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers unaware of her problem.
"No one knew," he said.
“ I was touching my head, and tears were known all the time.
It is not easy to explain, but I felt such a kind attitude toward Nad.
If he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her.
Displayers that have drawn cards to protect suicides on the widget
Two women who lost their loved one to commit suicide try to protect others from taking their life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards and encouraging messages and telephone numbers to people who would call for support.
Msz Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he started his own depression and suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel as I would feel every day," he said.
Msz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a prospective cook with an infectious disease.
"Everyone knew it because of his smile.
They were always talking about his smile.
Nevertheless, she quit the job before she died, as she was in a black area.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, could find his brother after he was alive.
Msz Davis said: "I always worry that there will be a straight knock."
Ms Davis created cards, "to let people know that there are people on the outside where you can talk to them, even if you are friends.
Don't keep quiet - you need to talk.
Msz Humphreys, who has been a friend for years with Ns Davies, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after Mom died.
‘ It doesn't mean she was feeling down or depressed or anything, ’ he said.
"Just a few days before Christmas we noticed her change in attitude.
She was on the lowest road at Christmas, when children opened their gifts, she didn't resist them with anything.
He said that his death was a great victim to them, but they must work with it: "He boasts of a hole in the family.

The future of Brett Kanavagh depends on the registration as the FBI initiates investigation
“ I thought, if we could find something like the one that was asked for at a time - it is limited to space - perhaps we enter little unity," says Mr Flake on Saturday, he added that he was running away from the committee "between the gridlock together.
Why do Mr Kavanough and his Republican sponsors want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of determination because of time.
The election election is completed for five weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do wrong, so they will be too weak in their attempt to find a man who would want to be elected to the highest court on earth.
George W. Bush has been taking the phone to call the Senators, asking to cooperate with Mr Kavanough, who worked at the Western House in Mr Bush and met with him and his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What happened after the FBI released its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where the Republic and Democratics are now seated.
It is not clear that Mr Kavanough would reach 50 votes on the level of the Senate, which would allow Mike Pance, president of the president, to break the certificate and convince him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea _fector number's drop-down number under Kim
The number of North Korean officers to South Korea has fallen from Kim Jong-un seven years ago, which the South Korean President said.
The Park Yeong-seug, which mentioned the points from the social service services of the South, said there was a security of 1,127 last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park says that the control cuts off the border between North Korea and China and the higher levels paid by major repairmen.
Pyongy did not make public opinion.
Most of the deaths from North are eventually donated by South Koreans.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Americans have fallen illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled through China, the longest border in North Korea, and it is easy to cross the Dilitised Zone (DMZ) over the two Koreans.
China is referred to as illegal migrants rather than runaways and often returns again and again.
The connection between the North and South - which has been acting officially in the wars of extremely successful in the months to come.
Earlier this month, two world leaders met in Pyongyang with some of the interviews.
This was followed by an official meeting of June between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work on the uncompetable Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Minister R Yong-ho says that the US sentences for not slow progress.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no hope for our national security and under such circumstances, we will not exploit it for the first time," says Mr. RI in a speech at the National General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanough "trough." she is not prepared to serve in the Supreme Court.
The young Princes Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court a Brett Kavanough "trough" and said that she was unfit to serve in the High Court.
Peter gave the answer to a Saturday’s discussion in Texas Tribune at Austin, Texas.
"I can't help, but I think if the woman had done that way, they would have been 'helping them,' Peter said about his reply to Kavanough before the Council of Courts on Thursday.
Kavanough was officially approved if he smoked sex by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
At an early age, Kavanough was very moody, sometimes crying out and getting together to talk about his family and his high school years.
He judged clearly the democracy on the committee, calling for criticism on the "Communication and social co-ordination" followed by special facilities if Hillary Clinton lost the selection of the national 2016.
Peter said that he believed Kavanough evidence that he could not serve in the High Court, since it showed that he was being abused by Democrats.
‘ I think you are ready for such comments and how they follow the Cantonns and the Democrats, ’ he said.
Peter was stressed when he was asked that he would try to disrupt the Kavanough if he was assured, and if the Democracys get more from the Prosecutors.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't tell the truth in the Congress or FBI, then he isn't qualified to be the Supreme Court, but to be in the present court," Peter said.
Kavanough currently judges in D.C.
Peter added that as a democracy he was concerned about the judgment of Kavanough Act or Roe v. Fare, as it is regarded as a last justice.
In his confirmation of the arrest, Kavanough had answered questions about whether he could change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone who is in danger, who is privately to go to court and waits for us to say, 'that' is not,' says Peter.
And wives want to protect it.
The diatribe is good, the month and year of anger, and cannot do it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrsz Steinem said to me afterward.
"I don't think about something strange, don't I?"
He went on to say, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a certain ruler in a certain place, who also cried when she cried, but who had developed a process which meant that when she was full of crying, she said to the person who was talking to her, "You think I am sorry because I cry."
I'm angry.
And she kept going.
And I thought it was wise.
Tears are allowed to become an emotional burden on one another because they are not properly understood.
One of my more sensitive reminders than the first job, in the male-man-man-man-in-law office, where I found myself crying out with unquoted dystrophys, was held on my neck by an elderly woman-I am always very afraid of - who drags me on the platform.
"Don't let them see them crying," he told me.
"He doesn't know that he is angry.
They think you are sad and happy because they come to you.
Patricia Schroeder, so the Democraticboman Society of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidentship.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a pasture outside a ship called the Battle of Monkey and came out of a race, Mrsz Schroeder, was very concerned, he might think that he had no reason to drive the president himself.
"We didn't think well," she said with a laugh after 30 years.
"There were seven heard in this competition, and the last thing they needed was one.
One called the " Snow White and the Seven Loved Ones."
Because it was after the campaign, it was after financial support, and then she vowed that she would not enter the race unless she had raised $2 million.
It was a lost war.
He found that some of his supporters who paid 1,000 men would give him only $250.
‘ Did they think I was getting a break?' She wondered.
When she made her statement that she would not engage in an official campaign, she was affected by the feeling of gratitude to the people who supported her, the frustration and a system that made it more difficult to raise money and direct votes than the delegates, and the anger on sexism - if she became mature.
"You think I'm going to be disturbed," recalls Mrssz Schroeder about how the printer reacted to him.
"You think Kleenex was my company's assistant.
I remember thinking that they would put it on my rock?
"Hush"?
How the U.S. - of China war can be a beautiful thing at Beijing
The salvos for the opening of the U.S. trade warfare between China was deaf, and while the conflict was far away, a conflict between countries can be useful to Beijing for a long time, say experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, dismissed the first warning at the beginning of the year by means of anthropomorphismal Chinese speech, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The significant rise has been corrected this week with new costs affecting the $200 billion cost (£15 billion) of goods, properly for all US tax from China.
Beijing is repeated again and again in a hurry, the tarffs have just paid to ten per cent of American $60 million.
China has promised to identify the US shot-shhot-shhot, and the majority of the world's economy will not be able to combine any time soon.
To get Washington back means to take the demands, but to bow to the United States will be very embarrassing to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can properly play its cards, the forcing of U.S. wars can surely help China more than long by reducing international independence.
"The fact that the immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing can make conditions which begin to throw us out of the economy in this country really more dangerous than the observers have seen before," says Abigail Grace, an experienced friend who is aimed at Asia, says the New American Security Culture, a thinker.
Syria 'has prepared' for the refugees to return, says the General of the Nations
Syria is responding willingly to the refugees and is promoting a revival of war - ravaged land for over seven years.
When speaking at the United Nations Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Mulalm said that conditions in the world are improving.
"Today the state of the world is truly thankful for the progress made in preventing violence," he said.
The State continues to rebuild areas damaged by the cover so as to restore habit.
All of the present is a voluntary return to a country where refugees have been forced to leave because of the violent economic and economic system that is not involved in their daily lives and their lives.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrian refugees since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country are in dire need of help.
"Al-Mulalem has said that the kingdom of Syria will receive help to rebuild the land that is destroyed.
But he stressed that they would not accept legal aid or help from member nations.
