This new area has different resources from most competitors, so new species require new processes or adapting to existing ones to compete more strongly than they used to be.

Such children are called ‘ real ’ animals, or monsters. Some of the real animals are kept in the custody of humans (usually their parents); in some cases the rejection of a child is caused by a parent’s mental or physical rejection of a child that has been impaired.
Grown children may be subject to physical abuse before it is left or neglected.
Some are thought to have been raised by animals; others were privately isolated in the forest.

Besides the sanana plantations, it is difficult for an animal to have a human digestive system to satisfy its acidity from the abundant natural vegetation.
Also, failure to do so can lead to serious problems, such as depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
Vegetation plants may contain proteins that are found in leaves and dances, but this is difficult for animals like us to digest except a boiled cat.
In contrast, the diet of animals (birds, ants, eggs) not only is written, but it provides an abundance of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
When we look at all the details, it should not surprise us that our grandparents have solved the problem of protein - rich plants, as they do today.
