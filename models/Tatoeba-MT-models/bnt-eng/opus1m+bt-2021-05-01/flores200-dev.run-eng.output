Stars provide light and heat because of the energy produced by the hydrogen atom that is assembled (or melted) together to make things heavier.
Researchers are developing a sheet that can provide the same energy as the stars.
This, in addition, is a very difficult problem to solve and will require many years before links with built-in importance are developed.
The needle’s eyelids float to the surface under pressure.
The force in it is formed because water molecules are at the balance of the water that is drawn more between them than they are drawn by wind molecules over it.
Water molecules that make an invisible skin on the surface of water cause objects like a needle to float over the surface of the water.

To return to their energy level, they must rid themselves of the excess energy they had derived from light.
They do this by sending small particles of light from the form of 'photon'
Researchers are not interested in the series - the sending is warned of by the radiation - because the particles of an object are awakened by light that has come, attracting the sending of light photons, and the light is also a kind of radiation.
The next picture shows atoms that release photons.very, of course, photons are much smaller than those on the photo.
Photons are much smaller than atoms!
