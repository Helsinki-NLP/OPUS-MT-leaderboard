Everyone participates in the public and uses transport systems. Nearly everyone complains about transport systems.
In developed countries it is at the same time that you hear the same reports about the water level and falling bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers unable to operate? Or is something more important happening?
The Mobile System is a study of the movements of every driver and car from one place to another and of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to learn the curve of the cargo because the decks of the propeller are not completely feasible.
