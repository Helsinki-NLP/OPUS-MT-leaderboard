Scientists are trying to build a energy source that can generate similar energy.
This, however, is a complex problem to solve and it will take years before we see the unifying agent built.
An iron needle floats above the water because of atomic collisions.
The collision occurs because the atom of water on the surface draws closer than the air does on it.
