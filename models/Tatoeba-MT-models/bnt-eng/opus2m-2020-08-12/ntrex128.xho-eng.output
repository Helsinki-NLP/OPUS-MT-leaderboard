Members of a Welsh convention are concerned about looking foolish
There are the concern of the Ams because it is promoted to change their terms into MWPs (a member of the Welsh Parliament).
This has been done since plans were made to change the name of the convention to Parliament of Wales.
The Ams in all politics is concerned that this will result in their being washed.
One AM of Labour says that his group is concerned that the terms of the new name are closer to the terms "Twp" and "Pwpp."
To the student who does not live in Wales: Welsh utwep means a foolish man and a prowp means a piece of tea.
The AM of the Welsh organisation said that the whole organization is not interested in this, and it gives some advice.
A member of the Conservative in Wales says that his group has no problem with changing words, but he has seen that it would be easier to call MWP as you call a fool.
In this case the English word w is similar to the English wordu letter.
The Assembly Commission, concerned with setting up a policy to change the term to this new one, said: "The decision of how to call the members of the Assembly will be taken by the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh conference permission to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public answers and found that the majority supported the change of the convention to be called the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the term AMs, the Commission prefers that Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but people support the MWP.
The AMS is said to offer some alternative advice, but that it is difficult to agree on this matter must be a problem for Ellin Jones, the Chief Officer, who is expected to make a decision about changes in the next weeks.
This policy of change will include other changes such as the function of the conference, including the rules to stop the AMs and the structure of the committee.
The Ms votes that will finally count when this rule is discussed in the question of how to be called.
Macedonians will vote to change their country’s name
The voters will vote on Sunday even though they have changed their country's name to "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
This vote is for a time set aside to settle the dispute over which Greece has a neighboring province of Macedonia.
The Athenians have long claimed that the name of their neighbors in the north makes them look suspicious in their area, and they have long resisted their application to be members of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjoge Ivanov, who is opposed to the amnesty vote, ignored the vote.
However, supporters of the vote, including General Zoran Zaev, say that this is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells As They St. Harlem Churches St.
Mr. Adams said: "The old people I spoke to said that there was a bar and a church everywhere."
"Today, none of them."
You understand why barley was suddenly scarce.
He said: "People will have a different way of life" these days.
"Bar is no longer the living quarters in the neighborhood where people regularly go."
He is concerned about the churches because he feels that the money they have received from selling their goods will not last as long as the leaders think, "and soon they will be back to their original position."
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by public furniture that will never help to retain the remains of local holy sites.
He said: "Many of the people who buy these pictures are white people, so the day will come when the churches will be closed, because they don't seem to be members of the churches."
Both were white churches before Harlem became the place of blacks, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, in St. Martin a decade later.
The first white Welese Congregation emerged in the 1930 ’ s.
The black congregation she served became the one that was built up.
St. Martin was a black congregation under the River. John Howard Johnson, who led the merchant to 125th Street, the main street in Harlem, opposed to unemployment and lack of support for black people.
In 1839 the building was badly damaged by fire, but as the members of Tat' Johnson's Church were preparing to rebuild it, they were ordered to beat the steel.
F. David Johnson, son and successor of Tat'Johnson in St. Martin's, called the beating of steel as "the irons of suffering people."
A professional steelman, who struck them, called it another way: "Technology" and "a historical instrument which will never be replaced."
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the world's first time that the instrument was played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a multi-inch Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merweather said that St. Martin's could not replace him.
The main feature here in St. Martin's for the past few months has been a conflict between architects and builders, some of whom were brought by non-teacher church leaders, others by the Rabe church.
The governing body, made up of nonteachers, wrote to the panel in July, is concerned that the division would not blame the congregation, although it did not contribute to the employment of the draftsmen and the contractors who were sent in the wrong direction.
Some members complained that the area did not count the matter.
A shark injures a child with 13-year diver to obtain lobsters in California
The authorities have said, the shark has attacked and wounded 13 boys on Saturday, when they were immersed to catch a lobster in California on the opening year of lobster.
This attack took place just before 7 morning near Beacon's Beach in Ekhitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV at San Diego that he had been swimming with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help. Then they swam to him to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said, at first I thought it was fun to hold a lobster, but later "he realized that it was crying, ‘ I’m a bite! ’
‘ I’m deleted!'
This is below the neck of the whole breast," Hammel noted when he reached the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' and Hammel said.
This boy is airborne to the Lady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in a bad state.
It is not known what kind of shark it has left.
“ The shark has been seen there in previous weeks, but it was not a dangerous type of shark, ” says Captain Captain Captain Captain Captain Captain Mary Giles.
Giles adds that the victim is seriously injured in the upper part of the body.
The officers have closed the sea from the Potto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Exinitas for 48 hours to check for safety.
Giles said that there are more than 113 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are said to be safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move its products to the UK makeup market.
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superrdrug and Debeenhams by having stores with oil and professional people to help people.
As an important way to get into the UK's makeup market for £2.8bn, which continues to grow while fashion and household products are on the decline, these huge districts with 11 brands will be tested in stores throughout the country, and will be available in more stores the next year if they run well.
The investment of cosmetics has occurred because these stores require use of empty shelves after being charged with TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's will increase the products of cosmetics with them twice as much as 3,000, including names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw.
Those already with them, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Butt's Bees, will have more room to place them in names similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The store will also inform the Boutique repair products so that more are suitable for non-eaters - the demand of new buyers.
Also, the Admiral Fragrance Shop will test the needs of two stores in Sainsbury's stores, the first opened at Croydon, south of London, this last week and the second will be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the course of the year.
To buy on - line even though people now buy very little food each day at a nearby store, this requires that large stores do more to encourage people to go to them.
Mike Coupe, the chief director of the Sainsbury's, said, these stores will look like big stores with a variety of products, as they try to fight the expensive department stores such as Aldi and Lild for more services and other non-food products.
Sainsbury's puts the Argos in many stores and starts in Havitats because it bought them both two years ago. This increased the purchase of food and made it profitable.
Efforts to improve the oil and the medical facilities of the former store have fallen.
His Sainsbury's tried to meet the Boots in the early 2000s, but they broke apart after fighting in a way of dividing the profits of the medical stores in their stores.
This new strategy was developed after the Sainsbury's sale of Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy stores, its 281 medical business in £125m, three years ago.
It says Lloyds will also share in this strategy, by increasing the high-speech products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy at four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, manager of trade at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance of the passages with our makeup to improve our customers.
We have planted money in our hands so that we can pass it on to others who have specialized training.
The various products we have are designed to be suitable for each plant, making it look for the place where it can be easily obtained, is now an interesting place of cosmetics and that is not the same as the old method of buying.
Peter Jones 'is angry' because Holly Willoughby has stopped the £11 Million industry.
Peter Jones noted in Dragoons Den left's anger after program driver Holly Willoughby quit the £11 Million industry industry to deal well with his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and TV.
Willoughby has no time for such household products as Trily.
The business of this couple was similar to the product Gwyneth Pack's Goop.
The driver of the This Morning program, with 37, has put it in the Instagram to go.
Holly Willoughby left famous for Dragoons" Den, Peter Jones angry that he left the last minute of the life-life industry factory - to take good care of his new answers with Marks & Spencer and TV.
The sources say that Jones was ‘ angry ’ when the important girl on TV admitted to a hot Tuesday meeting at her capital business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, if her new contracts - reaching to £1.5 million million - makes her less time for household products and decorations such as Truly.
This business is compared to the production of Gwyneth Palmrow's Goop and has received the money to double the sum of Willoughby's estimated £11 million.
As Willoughby, with 37, was putting in the Instaggram to leave Truly, Jones went to one of his vacation homes in Britain.
The source said: "Truly has been the most important thing for Holly.
It will be her back for a long time over the next ten years.
The decision to leave is a personal one.
Nobody believed what took place on Tuesday, near the party of identification.
There is a restaurant full of items at Marlow HQ for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of Thhis Morning, one of the most profitable in Britain, could consume millions of companies because of the heavy investment of materials from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and things that might further delay the establishment.
And this may mean the end of a long friendship.
The three mother of Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
"Ulloughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two go on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent of the Baldwin's television company.
Willoughby will be the agent for this M&S clinic and will replace Ant McPartlin as the moderator of the TV program I'm A Celebrity.
A nearby source to Jones said last day "We will not talk about her business affairs."
We said, ‘ Let's get in love.'
He has laughed at criticism from the press by saying what some consider to be a "disgrace" and to speak well of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such a sweeping change?
Trump said that with his embarrassing voice of the "mediator on my subject".
"I don't give up."
He noted that Kim was interested in seeing them again after the first meeting in Singapore on June and that Trump’s hat was held as a major step toward nuclear extinction in North Korea.
But the nuclear threat has come to an end.
More than three months after the June conference in Singapore, North Korea’s top commissioner Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the United Nations on Saturday of the House of the House of Justice that the North does not see the "a similar answer" from the United States to North Korea by actions of disarmament.
Rather, he said that the United States continues its target of oppression.
Trump has given hope to a talk he gave at his party.
"We're doing well with North Korea," said.
"We were fighting with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we are very close to one another.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim and with the best of results from the testing of missiles have led to the release of hostages and the restoration of American bones.
And she has defended her strange way of speaking about Kim.
"It is much easier to be presidents, than the 10,000 people outside trying to fit into this crowded stadium could have about 200 people standing here," The Trump then pointed to the crowd standing right before him.
Indonesia’s Tsunami and Nikikima destroy the Island, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Even though 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants were removed from the area, the area did not sound like a disaster zone, which would result in world relief.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they made it clear that they are not asking for world assistance, so this is a challenge," Mszn Sumung said.
While Save the Children collects a group to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreigners can work there.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster center, said that Indonesian officials surveyed the situation in Palu to see if world agencies would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Because of the constant quake in Indonesia, the country is not always prepared for earthquakes in a shocking way.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rare in some beaches.
The absence of a tsunami warning in Palu, though warned, may have contributed to the loss of lives.
With all the relatively few moments, traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make travel extremely difficult.
A hospital ship in Lombok to treat victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before it reaches the new scene.
President Joko Wido promoted the development of Indonesia’s deteriorating development when he broke down the election support, and he has spent a lot of money in repairing railways and railways.
But the lack of financial support has troubled Mr. See as it is to be re elected again next year.
On the other hand, Mr. Joko is faced with the stress of the sectarian struggle in Indonesia, where many Muslim members have been involved in the most difficult part of the service.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets with machetes, knives, and other dangerous weapons.

And I would like to urge anyone, especially the taxis, that they might take a photograph of anything with the dashcam to contact us as you probably have an important information.'
A police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body had been found in Birkenhead had been found in the middle of the property.
Well - thought - out friends ‘ have come to the wheelchair and ask questions about the location of the find that morning.
Research continues as police have tried to inform the victim’s immediate relatives.

The Cromwell statue is the last to be found by the struggle to ‘ rewrite history ’
The removal of them will be the righteousness of the assembly because of her destruction like that of Tababan in so many of England’s traditional and religious pictures by his zealous Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell described the advice of Mr Crick as "foolishness" and "try to write history again."
▪ John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It would not be possible for you to have in this discussion the removal of images if a statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Place of Westminster was a target.
The destruction of images in English wars was not ordered or done by the Cromwell.
Perhaps the late Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his great - grandfather Thomas of the past century.
The excellent way in which Sir William Hamo Thornycroft described Cromwell's observations of the 19th century and part of the history of many who still think his life should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than now, as an arbitrator of parliament against outside oppression, particularly in his case the pressure from the empire.
Whether this description is correct or not depends to a large extent on the ongoing debate of history.
The fact is that the strife in the mid- 17th century has contributed to the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell is a person who has identified himself as one who represents the same side of the conflict.
What they accomplish as the Chief Protector must be observed and remembered.
A Deadly Helmet Attacks a Chinese Farmer and Kills
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
A man, described only by his "Uan," was found to have a need for a broken muscle, covered with blood near the herd of pigs in the Liupanhui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pigs farm is preparing to milk his pigs at a hammock on May 30, 2005, in Xining Province of Qinghai, China.
It is said that he was accompanied by his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and he found that the door to the nearby herd of pigs was open.
He says that in the camp there was a large bull with blood on his mouth.
A study of the fossil record confirmed that the zebra’s weight of 550 pounds caused her death, according to the report.
"The patriarch's legs were blood and twisted," said the cousin's name "Wu," as quoted by Guilingan Evening News.
Safety cameras showed Yuan entering the market by 4.40 am on Thursday feeding the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig killed either Yuan or his cousin.
The chief of the market told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to protect other people from attack, while the police gathered a witness in the victim’s area.
the Yuan family and the authorities of the market are said to be talking about the payment of his death.
Although rare, it is the situation in which pigs are sometimes recorded when they attack people in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a cowman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, a man who was seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 600-weight pig caught a Welsh farmer on a tractor until his wife drove the pig away.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one of the Manitoba farmers told CBC News that the pigs did not feel angry but their drinking blood could cause them to do so.
They are only to play.
They are fingernails, very protective... with no intention of harming you.
You have to give them the right kind of cause,... you have to say.

More than 20 million people watched the fall of Kavanough Brett.
More than 20 million people were watching the testimony of the 4th person of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanough, and a senator who accused him of sexual abuse that took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political situation continues, with a broadcast that interrupts the plan of the fifth-year process to change at the last minute: a treaty by the Sen of Arizona, Jeff Flake, so that the FBI conducts one week's investigations in the case.
Ford told the Senate Executive Committee that he had made 100 percent sure that Kavanough had put his hand under the influence of alcohol and had tried to free him from the high school party.
Kavanaugh, in physical evidence, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It is common to have more than 20.4 million people watched the report by Nelson on Friday.
The company counted the size of the followers in the news of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers have not been available at this time to be visible on other network, including PSS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And nielsen has the difficulty of measuring people who have been watching in office.
To put it in this case, the size of the followers is similar when watching the final steps in a soccer game or the Study Week.
The Fox Channel of News, with its view to having a system that strongly supports the election of Kavanough, guides all the other network by having followers of 5.69 million during the day-sing, says Nielsen.
ABC was in the second position with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.9 million, the MSNBC had 2.89 million and the CN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
The interest remains high after the advice.
Folake was the favorite to discuss the drama in the fifth drama
After the central office of the Rippulch had issued a vote for Kavanough, he was obtained by the CNN and CBS Cameras on the fifth morning of the campaign as he tried to climb a senator to the level of the Governing Body.
He has stood his eyes in shock for several minutes as he criticized, talking at the moment on CNN TV.
"I stand here in front of you," said the figure of the speaker.
"Do you think you are saying the truth to the country?
He was told that he was told, "He is strong when many in the reveal are weak."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said that before closing the receipt, there was more to speak to the counseling committee.
the network of broadcasts and cables were all distributing them at this time in the following hours, while the Executive Committee would choose to continue the election of Kavanough to the full vote.
But Flake says he will do so only in harmony with the FBI where he will look at charges against the election of the next week, where the Democrats are only a few parties advised.
Flake has advised this to speak to her relative, The Democrat's conator Chris Coos.
After talking with Leons and other computers after that, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s choice is strong, for there is evidence that the Librarians did not vote to accept Kavanauh without further research.
President Trump opened a study of the FBI to investigate his charges against Kavanough.

Don't enter an article that gave Livingston 1-0 and made a success of the Rangers
The first article of Dolly Menga and victory in Livingston
The extension of Livingston shocked Langers by passing Steven Gerrad twice in 18 games to be made the master of the Ibrax club.
The aggressive player Dolly Menga has proved to be a difference as Gary Holt's side increased the level with the Hiberanian in a second.
Gerrrard's side is already unable to succeed in the Premiership games in this position and facing the Heats leaders, who draw eight points, to the coming Sunday.
Before that, the Frangers had met Rapid Vienna in the European League by the fourth.
Livingston, at present, described their winning level in this section to six games, in which the senior instructor Holt has been a winner since claimed to replace Kenny Miler in the past month.
Livingston has missed the opportunity of unauthorized visitors
Holt's group should have led before they put the facts, which is the direct cause that the Rangers have all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson has made it clear that to attract your efforts by facing the article, Alan Lithlow would not direct his efforts to the back by entering
Hotels were happy to see Langers playing in front of them, knowing that they could cause no harm to their guests.
And that is how it comes to an important article.
The Langers have received the free kick and the Livingston has worked on opening, the Declan Gallagher and Robinson met by setting Menga, which has touched the ball to put a score from the middle of the box.
At this point, the Rangers were the most likely to catch a ball, but they found that the license was strong and the middleman Liam Kelly was not in trouble.
The seizures continued the second half, though Alfonso Morelos forced the ball to close.
Scott Pittman has been rejected on the foot of the Rageers's top athlete Allan McGregor and Lithbow who has cast an extra ball from another Livingston player.
Crossing balls continued to come to the Livingston taxi and continued to be clarified, while there were two penitentials after the test Halket's replacement of Glen Middleton, one was the handball.

To play with the marvelous decks and the outcomes of Livingstone.
For the man. They were outstanding, they continued to be outstanding in all the expectations of the cast-up course ahead.
Their play and control have not changed since they returned with a good aircraft, but their reputation is given Holt in the way he has shaped the team as ever he has arrived.
He had many powerful men.
The gang leader Halket has had a body, conducting the sub-profession, while Menga kept the Conor Goldson and Joe Worral in their backs all the time.
Rangers were in need of encouragement.
Even though they had played well at certain times under the rule of Gerrad, they had fallen short of that.
Their last ball was only a failure where they cut out their home-operation code-and that was a raising factor for the Rangers, which they found to be in the middle of the table.

Hundreds of Indonesia are killed by an earthquake, the Tsunami appears to have a growing circle
At least 384 people were killed, many were swept away by great waves that hit the seas, where great earthquakes and tsunamis have hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, the authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people have gathered at the party on the Palu Sea's 5th day where the waves are up 6 feet (18 m) high in the dry ground, killing people because they have killed many people and were causing damage to their path.
The tsunami follows 7.5 knots.
"While the tsunami promised to appear yesterday, the people were doing their duties at sea and did not immediately run away and were the victims," Sutopo Puro Nugroho, the Indonesian Minister of the BenpB Services Service spoke of it when he gave a comment in Jakarta.
"The tsunami never traveled alone, towing cars, blocks, houses, towing everything on the earth", said Nugroho, added that the tsunami had gone through the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before reaching the shore.
Some people are willing to climb trees because they try to avoid tsunamis and survive.
About 6,700 people have been moved from their homes to 24 Palu centers.
The Aerial photographs were issued by an officer of emergency services that showed many buildings and stores destroyed by tsunamis, munitive and fallen bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The tsunamis have continued to move along the coast of the city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes is concentrated in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Commission for the Test of Technology (BPT) said that in its speech the largest earthquake was 200 times greater than the nuclear explosion cast at Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The state of science in the City, which is located at the end of the length, the closing of the harbor, can increase the size of the storm, the claim.
Nugroho described the damage as "grand" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, stores, and hotels have collapsed.

"This is already a disaster, but it can be even more," he said.
On Saturday the agents were criticized in the country for not letting themselves be struck by the Palu tsunamis, although the officers said that there had come waves at the time of warning.
Photography paintings have been shared on television pages in which a man was above the level of the building warning against despair when a tsunami reached the people and the streets below.
Within minutes the water wall has hit the shore and taken the buildings and cars away.

The earthquake and the tsunami caused great power to break up the links in the Peruvian area and made it difficult for the authorities to carry out efforts to rescue them.
The armies have begun to send more carcargo and relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but those who left their homes were in dire need of food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has been reopened for only the purpose of helping together and will remain closed until October.

Too bad
And like rescue teams who begin to express strong feelings of relief gear, some complain that the more skilled foreign aid workers have been prevented from going to Palu.
According to Indonesian policies, financial support, sponsors and employment of overseas workers can only begin to move if a disaster site is declared to be a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"The disaster of the province," says Aulia Arriani, the talker of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"The President once said, "AYY., this is a State disaster," we can open the aid to the World but we still have no stage.

Once West: Irapper has changed his name, Ye
Rapper musician Kane West has changed my name.
When describing his change of name, he wrote to Twitter on Saturday, he said: "It was officially known that he was the West."
The West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a long time and has been using Moniker as the title of his eight-disposed disc, which has emerged.
This change took place before he appeared in the Light Live on Saturday, where he was expected to complete his new copy Yandi.
She has entered the place of a singer named Ariana Grande who has withdrawn for her "for her reasons", says a cowmaker.2]
Since this is an abbreviated form of terms in the current name justly, West declared to the day that this name plays a role in the importance of religion to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common and widely used term in the Bible, which means "you", West said that at the beginning of this year, when he was discussing the title of his recording with the DJ radio Big Boy. This is the most common and most commonly used term in the Bible.
"All of you, I am you, and I say,
He puts it upon Caine, meaning that he alone, to Him – because we are a manifestation of good things, our confusion, of everything.
The disc is an indication of what this is.
It is one of the best - known rates of rappers that has changed the name.
Sean Combs have been known by these words with different names given to Puff Diddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year you decided that you prefer to be called by these words Love, Love Is Love.

Mexico's AMLO had promised no military service on citizens.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use private security forces as the country reached the 50th anniversary of student injury and revenge.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatolelco Plaza that "he will never use forces to oppress the Mexicans."
The forces started shooting in the show on October 2, 1968, and killed more than 300 people during the school-based conferences in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youths by providing monthly support for their students and by opening a number of open universities for the public.

The U.S. has repeated A.I financial support.
China is becoming more and more active in nonneutral Intelligence, the U.S. needs to repeat the time it spends in the research section, so says the client and the AI supporter Kai- Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These compartments will come after various U.S. government sections have made declarations of AI, and such as the U.S., fail in all the official AI methods.
In the meantime, China announced its plan this past year: it was intended to be No.1 on the AI plan in 2030.
"Repetition of the AI research chart will be a good start, as all other countries are far behind the U.S., and look at the next design of AI," says Lee.
Repeating financial support may multiply the chances of the next major AI success that will be done in the U.S., says Lee in an interview with the CNBCs this week.
Lee, author of the book "The Power of AI: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" are published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of the Country Ventures, which supports one of the largest AI companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on the AI system that struck the most prominent American nobleman Othello peyer, who was the head of the Microsoft Survey, and who was the president of Google at the China branch.
Lee has accepted the previous competition for U.S. government technology as the Challenge of the Robots of the Major Security Research Project and has asked when it will occur next, to determine the following criteria.
U.S. researchers have to work hard to win government financial support, says Lee.
"It's not China to take the lead in education; it's a unified body," says Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technical companies have hired professionals from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that a change in foreign travel police may help to support its AI efforts.
"I think a green card will be automatically provided to those who make PhD's on the AI," says.
The National Council of China issued its Non-Technification Plan in the Next Generation in July 2017.
China’s National Institute of Natural Science provides financial support for students in the same educational institutions as the Department of Natural Science and other government institutions that contribute money to the U.S. researchers, but the level of education is inferior to China, says Lee.
Early this year in the U.S. Security Department established a Non-Intellect Center, which was designed for the participation of cooperative groups from production to education, and the White House announced the establishment of the election of an Intelligent Committee.
And this month the DARPA announced $2 billion as the start of the trial called the next AI.
As the NSF, it now has more than $100 million a year for research on AI.
Meanwhile, a U.S. policy intended to create a National Security Commission in Non-Technology is not yet introduced these months.
The Macedonians have voted on the balance to give the name of their country.
The Macedonians have chosen in the balanceendum on Sunday to change the name of the country to "Europe of the Northern Macedonia," an action that will resolve a long ten-year dispute with the members to call for values in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, with a province called Macedonia, wants its neighbors from the Northern Hemisphere to take its place and close the entrance to NATO and EU.
Two governments concluded a treaty on June based on the request for a new name, but the National Osteoporists object to the change of the term, saying that it undermines the origin and culture of the majority of the Macedonian's Slavic nation.
President Gjoge Ivanov said that he would not vote for refenendum and the non-compensive subaturdatic is not sure that people who will vote can meet the requirements to meet the minimum of 50 per cent necessary to carry out the approved referunduum choice.
The question on the election card reads: "May you be a member of the NATO and EU which accepts a concordat with Greece."
The promoters of word replacement, including Prime Minister Zoran Zoev, argue that the price paid is appropriate for adoption on such boards as the EU and the NATO of Macedonia, which is one of the countries to meet in the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I've come here to choose the future of this country, making it possible for new people here in Macedonia to live freely under the European Union protection, for that will mean a safe life for all of us," says Olivera Georgijvska, 79 in Skopje.
Although not legally bound, members of parliament have said they would commit themselves to the results of votes so as to make it necessary.
The change of the word will require two thirds of the parliament.
The country's election commission said there were no unusual reports of 1 p.m.
Even so, the people present stood 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous Parliament election of 2016, where they were 66 percent of the votes.
"I am here to vote my children so that our place is in Eurpe," says Gjose Tanevski, who has 62, and who would vote in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zeev, his wife, Zorica, and his son Dushko have voted in Macedonia for a change of word that will open the way for NATO and European Union to join in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament at Skopje, Vladimir Kavardkov, with 54, repaired a small platform and moved the seats that were set up against the refininduum.
"We are the NATO and the EU, but we want to join actively, not in the services of the door" says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
IF WE do not want to accept it as Macedonians, we can convert countries such as China and Russia into part of the euro-Asian League.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO's membership will bring much of the demand in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 percent.
‘ I believe that many people will like that because there are more than 80 percent of the inhabitants who like Nato and the EU," says Zaeva after the election on the map.
He said that "Yes" would be the result of "sure our future."
The list of votes will be published on the last Monday by the Macedonian Police Research Center is between 30 percent and 43 percent of the electorate who will participate in the refinanum-below the number required for the vote to be successful.
One list of votes, operated by the Macedonian Telma TV, was found 57 percent of the people prepared to vote on Sunday.
The majority of participants indicated that they would choose "yes".
For referunum to be effective, the election must be 50 percent of the people and one person above.
The failure of refeendum will bring the first powerful blow to the pro- Western government police since its taking of the cables in May this past year.

Trump gears in West Virginia
The President pointed directly to the situation surrounding the person he chose in the Supreme Court while speaking about the importance of the exit of the Republic of
"All that we have done can be lost in November.
The remaining five weeks before history’s most important election in our time are called.
This great election is large, large "sporters" and I really don't run, that's what I'm going around to want to find suitable people," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see the bad characters, the bad things of the Democrats gang, you see them taking place right now.
And he is determined to take over their authority by using whatever means are necessary, cruel, and merciless.
No matter who has hurt them, who will go above them, to gain power to control and control, and, of course, only what they need with power to control, will we not give it."
The Democrats, he said, are in electronic devices on a mission to "resulting and Disturbing."
"And you have seen what is happening in the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "because they are angry with cruelty and insubordination.
He referred to the Senate Executive Committee on the Democratis Democraticis Dianne Feinstein by his name, where he had received greetings from onlookers.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you moved in with a trust?
Uh, oh, what is it.
No, no, I am waiting for one – it was worse to mean the body -- to speak of the body in such a bad way that I didn't see it."
The bright Labour was full of lots.
It is difficult to speak up about their thoughts
While the Momentum's acticists in my local group voted against me, it was a surprise.
After all of this, I am the top of the Labour Ms to be told unconventionally by all of them who say what they are thinking.
My partner, Joan Ryan, had similar treatment with me and then confidently stood up against the Jews.
In my case, my criticism and opposition was against Jeremy Corbyn.
In the important police of the working economic system, the national security of the country, Europe, by embezzling similar issues where Jeremy disagrees with former leaders.
The Public Meeting Nonthingham East Barour wrote that "we want meetings to be included and have the appropriate results."
For almost eight years I have been the localMP for Labour, the GC meetings for the five nights have always been the same.
Where it is bad today, then, this modern meeting is not the only one for which we usually have "humane and soft, political" is now forgotten, however, and never start again.
It seems that an increasing variety of views differing from that of the Labour group is not accepted, and the whole opinion is considered before being accepted in the gang watch.
This began after Jeremy entered the administration seat, as a fellow employee and I had thought of sharing the same political views that I was expected to change quickly and take over places I would not agree with, either for national security or even for an EU business even if it was one.
Whenever I speak out-and I don't care about it, then the harassment on the man pages is ordered to be lowered on the seat, not to be accepted by the party's politics, I'm told that I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that’s a real experience for me.
I know, too, that I am more fortunate than my fellow workers as concrete is brought directly to me and they like to be involved in politics.
I respect the skill and determination of my colleagues who are faced with daily sexual or racial harassment but who can’t take them away.
One of the most controversial issues in human history is the threat of social and political violence.
Jeremy Corbyn reported this past week that the Labour team had adopted the art of patient endurance.
The truth is that we are no longer the big church and in the form of a ‘ hopeless ’ or of changing the principles of the division.
I have many suggestions over the past two years asking me to give up, not to speak in this way and then "all is good."
But that is no longer a matter of what I do in politics.
Since I joined Labour in 32 years as a school student, to be incited by the Thitcher government, don't take care of the neglect of my room which I had left down, since then I have vowed that I would fight for the best public services and those that they need, especially though I have been the planning officer or minister.
I did not hide my involvement in politics, including the previous election.
No one in the East of Nottingham can be confused in any way about where I stand in my police, and where I do not agree with the current guides.
In these improved circumstances now on Friday, in all cases I would say that when Brexit influences you to harm your homes, businesses and our public services, I don't understand his desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Lavour team.
But the truth is that my one message does not go to the Nottingham Momentum, to my people, whether they are members of the Labour or not: I take pride in your workings and promise that there is no price for fear or for political help that will prevent me from doing what I believe are your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr moving ahead
The two later tributaries are inclined to the finals of nearly the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves such a fine victory for the celebration of the Tennet's Premiership Day game.
Now they increase the level, the main part of the division.
Finally, it was their high-surface protection, as well as their opportunity to take a better chance, resulting in a corruption of the home side and the trainer Peter Murchie.
‘ We have been tested in our games until now, and we are no longer beaten, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Respecting Ayr, they do better than we have done."
Grant Anderson in his dry in 14 minutes, replaced by Frizier Climo, then put Ayr in front, but, the Scottish cap card, released by the Warriers, allowed Melrose to make the boils clear and Jason Baggot to try to change them.
Climo outlined Ayr leadership by Penalty, before, the half-time of the game, he added a score and then changed that try to make it 17-5 to Ayr during rest.
But the Melrose has started well into the second half and the Patrick Anderson's road, which was converted by the Baggot, reduced the turn of the five points.
It has been said that a long time of severe injuries caused by Ruaridh Knott, who has suffered from bouts of anxiety, and by the resurgence of Ayr, it has increased rapidly by Stafford McDowell’s highway, translated by Climo.
Ayr Captain Blair Macpherson has been given a yellow card, and again, Melrose has fined another man with Bruce Colvine's untranslated wheel, under great pressure.
However, it was returned home and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for hanging Climo without a ball in front of the Penalti line, Macperson has gone to bed back as Ayr was pursued.
Climo has changed, as it has almost since the beginning, when Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong’s balls into a box and sent the flunka Gregor Henry until he installed a fifth - wheel.
The Master Still Game seems to be focused on a new job in the poster
Still Game Chief Ford Kieran seems determined in the reception section after it was discovered that he had been appointed director of a licensed security company.
A 56-year-oldman plays Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, which he also writes with a professional comical expert Greg Hemphill.
The two have already indicated that the next nine will be the last to conduct the exhibition and that Kieran is evidently planning to do something else after Craiglang.
According to the record, he is the ruler of the Adriftmorn Limited.
This player has not wanted to note with this article, although the Scottish Sun source has said that Kiernan wants to join the "safe business of the day's trailers" in Glasgow.
'Our Sea': Bolivia closed up on earth hope that the road will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors set sail from La Paz.
Public talk signals the blue flag.
The naval plates from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are inflammable in the words "Our Sea is ours by law.
It is our duty to find it again.
In all of Bolivia's closed world, memories of Chile's coast in the war of great wealth in the 19th century are as vivid as their desire to return to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes have been more high over the centuries, as Bolivia awaits the adverse judgment of a world law court on October 1 after five years of discussion.
"A Bolivia has power, a spirit of unity and stability, and waiting in good spirit are the results," says Roberto Calladilla, a Bolivian ambassador.
Many of the people of Bolivia will hear the judgment of the World’s Constitutional Court on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will stand by Bolivia’s case for decades after being spoken again in Chile, it is necessary to consider giving Bolivia a noble land into the sea.
Evo Morales, a Bolivian president with life and a native - born destined to be reelected next year, also has much to do on the Monday sentence.
"We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean," confirm what it says by the end of August.
But some observers of the community would not likely judge Bolivia’s side - by - side.
The United Nations Society established in the Netherlands-has no power to remove Chile's soil, and says that it cannot know the effects of the talks.
The fact that the sentence of the World’s Constitutional Court was issued only six months after the discussion indicates that the case was "free from question," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean legal expert.
And instead of cooperating with Bolivia’s desires, it may be four years of recovery.
"The matter of seaborne access has been captured by the existing Bolivian government," says Zárate.
Morales ’ words have all but ended with any kindness they still had in Chile, says.
Bolivia and Chile will yet talk again, but it will be difficult to hold discussions after that.
These two countries have not sent out the ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative of The Hague, dismissed the court’s decision as strange.
Monday will give Bolivia "a special opportunity to open a new page of cooperation with Chile" and the opportunity to "end the 139 years of conflict with profits," says.
Calcutta also denied the fact that Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - uses the sea as a political base.
"The Bolivia will never relinquish its right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"This judgment is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome things that have happened in the past."
North Korea says that it will not abandon nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
According to North Korea’s Prime Minister Ri Yong Ho, his country will never give up its nuclear arsenal if he does not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday in the United Nations Parliament.
He asked the United States to follow up on promises made during the Singapore summit.
With those words, President Mike Pompio was about to resume a nuclear exchange that had been abandoned more than three months after those in Singapore with Kim Jong Un in North Korea.
Ri says it is a "suppose" that the continuing and refusing of the United States is a proposal to end the Korean War that will eventually cause the North to surrender.
Washington is careful to agree to this agreement before Pyongngng would first take steps to eliminate these weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump wanted a second conference.
But many people doubt that Pyongju is willing to give up the arms the country views as the only way to make sure that it is safe.
Pompio plans to visit Pyongyang for the assembly held by Kim and Trump next month.
The Paris fashion display shows the latest style you will see on the streets of a nearby town
If you want to increase the hats you have or want to block the sun, then don't go somewhere else.
The architects Valentino and Thom Browne began to make a number of most of the largest of the SS 19 exhibits that fell alongside the deck set on the Paris Fashion Week.
These impressive hats have flooded the Insagram this summer, and the designers have sent their impressive hats to the exhibition.
Valentino's lone hat is a broad feather and covers the whole head of the captain.
Some helmets were overlaid with jewelry, head coverings, and even necklaces, but they were not designed to warm your head.
Thomas Browne, however, brought with him a series of awe - inspiring masks right at the time of the Northern Hemisphere.
Many of these colorful masks have entwined lips and are much more like Hannibal Lectter than fashion.
One hat would be to enter water with breathing and throat while the other was like a cinder of melted ice cream.
And if you like the fads of fashion, you are fortunate.
Faders point out that this patch of hats may also be coming to your neighborhood.
These outstanding hats are on the feet of the La Bonba', a two-foot sun hat worn by people like Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The label that made these unusual hats that filled the pages of communication has brought another great display - a grass bag carried off on the coast that is almost as large as the officer in the bathing clothes you are carrying.
Theraffia bear of the orange bag, with the top edge of the luffia with a white eye, was the top of the collection of Jacques' La Riviera SS19 in Paris's Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Aritage has told her FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and seabags reach people the next summer - as designers have thrown them away, it will be difficult to ignore the people who would have been looking for these great things.'
John Edward: Language skills that are important to people of the world
Scotland's private schools have a reputation for academic success, and this has continued in 2018 with other final examinations, which are strengthened by individuals and class success in sports, art, music and other public projects.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are trying to offer a high level of service to their students and parents.
Private schools try to prepare their students for high school, private and secular education.
As a class of education that can design and install a school system appropriate to the situation, we see the available languages continue to be a popular and required course in school.
Nelson Mandela once said: "When you speak to a person in a language he understands, you reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his language you reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English for the companionship and trust of foreigners.
From the recent results of testing, we can see that languages are high on the tablet at high level in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign-ling students received articles in the Higher Grade A.
data gathered, in 74 SCIS schools, shows that 72 percent of students received the Highergrade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 64 percent of Spanish students received A.
This indicates that the independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as valuable skills for children and young ones in the future.
Now languages, such as the subject being selected, are equally valued as studies of STEM (science, chemistry, engineering and metamorphosis) in private and other schools.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Promotion and Skills in 2014 found that in reasons given by employers for the problem of filling positions, 17 percent are linked to the lack of language skills.
As a result, more and more language skills are needed to prepare young people for future tasks.
As more work opportunities require languages, these qualities are vital in a united world.
No matter what job one chooses, if you learn a new language, you will have a greater chance of acquiring the same skill in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people of other nations has opened up opportunities to have access to many languages.
According to the trials of the You Gov adult population of fewer than 4,000 UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak another language well enough to communicate, and only French spoke more than 15 percent, 15 percent.
That is why investment in the development of language is now important for young people.
Learning a number of languages, especially those in developing lands, will provide children with an excellent opportunity to find a better job.
In Scotland, there will be differences in the languages we teach.
A number of schools will concentrate on the current languages of the past, while others will teach languages thought to be most important in the UK in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child likes, there will always be a number of languages in which you can choose in private schools, including teachers in this section.
The Scottish private schools are endeavoring to prepare an educational environment that will equip the children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter where they go in the future.
There is no denying now, in the world’s business climate, that languages continue to play an important role in the future of this world, so this must be seen in education.
In fact, modern languages must be viewed as a "world communications" ability.
The independent schools will continue to offer this option, the separation and retirement for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien.
John Edward Head of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools

Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, You Tube Channel
President Donald Trump introduces his controversial conferences this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is her first five - week assembly for Trump in the coming week, including a visit to friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the certificate receipt is set up until he is selected to be appointed to the Supreme Court, Trump tries to suppress the favor of the second election since the Republics are in danger of losing the Congriss control at the election of Nov.
When will the Trump convention in West Virginia be held, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump Assembly of Wheeling, West Virginia, is reserved for 7 p.m. ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the “Trump convention of West Virginia on - line with the Dormi District Convention on YouTube.
Trump is considered to speak at this week’s meeting of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanough, who is in a difficult situation because of accusations of sexual misconduct, it is likely to be set up for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help the Republic to withstand the election of November.
As a result, President Trump's campaign stated that these five meetings in the next week are aimed for "building volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and increase their number in the legislature and the President’s House," Reuters says.
"Congres management is so important to him that the president will go to so many countries as we approach a busy voltage house," the speaker of Tump's ticket who did not want to be known to tell him what Reuters is.
Packaged at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today's standard of night can provide support from "Oio and Pensylvania and known in Pittsburgh by news reports," says West Virginia City News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visited West Virginia, which the state division won by over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to help the West Virginia Republicene Patrick Morrison, who is behind this election.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is obliged to come to support him," says Simon Head, a physicist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
The Ryder Cup 2018: An American team indicates that if you hunger for success you will continue to fight as if you were looking to go to individual sports on Sunday.
After three games alone, playing as the front for four people was the demand for the Ryder Cup.
The top position in any group has made the idea of the games the players believe in, and in the competitions like this.
So who is taking the lead right now?
‘ They have contributed six points and are now four, ’ says Jordan Spieth while he is walking that day.
Europe has taken this opportunity, in fact, with 4 points more than and another 12 yet unconventional.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they are doing well and that they can find a lot of interest, including how Spieth and Justin played well all day and they have three to four points.
Spieth has been a very good play since the start and is a good example.
When people shout in applause while he thumps, he puts the ball at a crucial time after both he and Thomas were shot in two.
Playing a ball in a hole that leads to winning the game by 15 causes people to shout in a similar way, telling them that the American team will not be defeated.
"You have to worry about your game at all," says Spieth.
They left behind.
18 holes to mark them.
The players with score above Spieth and Thomas on two days ago are Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleet, the opposition story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s roads lead to strange marriages, and there is nothing wrong with it.
"A couple called "Moliwood" are the one who did not attack the bogy on Saturday afternoon and Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Back Nine on Friday morning.
That cooperation, along with their interest, seems to be as beautiful to the multitudes as they must win with the church, and no other famous performer can win Europe when the sun sets down in the Le Gulf National than Fleetwood and Molinari.
It is best to play together at the same time in different places.
To speak of the success of Europe has not yet been seen, however.
Bob Watson and Web Simpson performed the task of Sergio Garcia, four football hero in the morning, when he got a co-operation with Alex Noren.
The Bogey and other points consisting of a couple of refuge four and a Spanish hole and a Swill that they could not get out of.
On Sunday, though, no one can help you out of that hole.
Four footballs and four players enjoy watching them close up because of the cooperation of the combined community, the advice they offer, the advice they don't offer, and how the program can change in a short period of time.
Europe has played better as a group until now and is leading to the last day, but the four players have shown that the American team has been in some unlikely, especially Stateside.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cups
Europe will take the lead well on the last day of the Ryder Cup after four articles and four sports games have made them pay 10-6 in America.
It is of interest to Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary to turn the game over the poor Tiger Woods to make further progress in The Gulf National in four points.
The European case of Thomas Bjorn, seeks to conquer the kudu that defeated in Hazeltine the previous two years, defeating the morning American case by four points, winning a series of games by 31.
America has not responded to four sports events, and it has won two games, although it would not be possible to eliminate the debt.
Jim Furyk’s side requires eight points of 12 individual sports to win this prize.
Fleetwood was the first European to draw four points and be new at the same time as Moninari, called ‘ Moliliwood" after the weekend of the first couple to win four points at the opening of the Ryder Cup.
Woods and Patrick Reed out of four footballs and overrun Woodsn and American heysin Dechambeu on 5 and 4.
Woods, who has drawn himself to two Saturday games, showed there and then interest but divided 19 of 29 games in four footballs with four players and scores in a row.
Justin Rose is resting early in the morning hours and with her companion Henrik Stenson of Foursome in 21 and 1 for opposing Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - world leader
Europe did not conquer France easily.
Three of the winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas did a fine thing for the Americans to receive two articles on Saturday.
They won 2 more than 1 when playing with the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of the four four four four-pounders separated the Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4 and 3 of the four four four of the four fo'c's.
Twice in the Ryder Cup, the team returns from division by four points to individual sports, though Fryk’s role requires a win to each other to receive the right
Two days later, the Sunday attack came.
North Korea says that ‘ she will never complete her equipment before she could be secured.
The director of an Foreign Center in North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that these sentences cast doubt on one another between America and there was no way that America could complete its Nuclear equipment if she could obtain security certificates.
Ri Yong Ho has told the board of those present to take positive steps the past year, such as to stop the testing of the armament and to drop the Nuclear armaments, and to promise that we should no longer make Nuclear weapons.
‘ In spite of this, we don't see the corresponding steps from America,' says.
‘ If there is no promise from America, there will be no confidence in the security of our country and in this case we will never displace our weapons without speaking to America.'
While Ri repeats what has been said by North Korea about the refusal of America to finish Nuclear's equipment in subsections and the North Korea has been rewarded for the small steps they have taken, his report did not deny that Pyonggngy had done to finish badly.
Ri spoke of a joint report published by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first conference between the president of the United States and the king of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work "Daclear's equipment instead of Korea" while Trump promised the security of Korea.
North Korea wanted to end the Korean War of 1950-53 by law, but the American said that the Pynyang should first eliminate the Nuclear armaments.
The Wahington requested no proposals to reduce the severe international sentences facing North Korea.
"America forces "the completion of Nuclear armament first" and increases the pressure level with sentences to achieve its purpose in a forced manner, against the declarations of the end of war," says R.
"The idea that sentences can frighten us is the dream of a false man who knows nothing about us.
But the problem is that these sentences will increase the confidence.
Ri did not speak of the plans for another assembly of Kim and Trump, which the American president spoke before the United Nations this week.
Instead, the officer spoke of three meetings between Kim and the Prince of South Korea and Monon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the crew in this case of Nuclear is South Korea and not South America, did it not stand?
Even so, Ri’s expression sounds different than last year, when speaking to the general U.N. general assembly that the targeting of North Korea's aircraft could not be avoided after the "Mn". The wicked President called Kim "a man of flying instruments" who wanted to kill himself.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "complete destruction" North Korea, has courageously given Kim praise for taking steps to eliminate the weapons, but says that it has much more work to do and the judgments will remain long enough for North Korea to finish Nuclear's equipment.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time for that, meaning "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang with the initiative.
However, the American secretary of state Mike Pompeo told the U.N.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The strengthening of the rulings of the Security Council must not go on and on until we have seen the complete and sure finishing of the Nuclear armament."
The Security Council has extended sentences in North Korea since 2006 for the expense of the Nuclear flying equipment systems of Pyonyang.
Pompio met Ri over the U.N. General Assembly and said he would visit Pynyang again to prepare for the second conference.
Pompey had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not very successful.
He left Pyynyang in July saying that progress had been made, but North Korea took the place to claim that he created a "crime likes like those made by robbers."
North Korea promised to meet Moon this month so that they could break up the space of the flying Nuclear armament if America was "compacts."
Kim told him that the "compliance measures" that Trump sought for security confirmations that Trump promised in Singapore and development in normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take enough rest
A new study at Harvard University this year made all unscheduled students sleep enough to fight the habit of reading throughout the night using caffeine.'
One expert found that students at the top of the university did not know the basics of their education.
Charles Czeisler, a staff of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, conducted this study, believed to be the first of this type in America.
He was encouraged by his talk about the effects of insufficient sleep on the studies.
'When she finished one class of this class, one girl came up and said: ‘ Why am I told that now, am I going to finish school?'
She said to me that no one had told her how important I was to sleep - that surprised me, ’ she told The Telegraph.
This study is introduced this year, explaining the benefits of sleeping in connection with educational and sports development, including improving their general health.
Paul Barreira, a lecturer in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and senior health - care officer at the university, said that the university has decided to bring the study after the students have not really gone to sleep.
This one - hour study involves a series of good works.
In one section there is a picture of the university bedroom, where students click coffee cups, curtains, training clothing and books for the purpose of explaining the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects the development of sports.
In one section, the participants are told how sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The school map, with its absorbing characteristics, encourages the participants to think about their daily activities.
‘ We know that we will never change the behavior of the students' immediately.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know you as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking cans," says teacher Czeisler, adding.
The tendency to lose sleep is still present, he adds, that modern technology and pressure from students is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep should be an unheard of instrument for combating stress, fatigue, and anxiety, and even keeping your weight off, as sleep disorders impair the brain, making it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old resident of California, who is studying chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler take a course in this class, after he attended his first year in Harvard.
He says that the class opened his eyes and gave him the desire to make the class available to the whole school.
He hopes that the next step is to ask the conscientious students to make the same reading program before entering the competition center.
The researcher Czeisler suggests that students think that they make a sleep alarm, along with waking, and that they are alert to the harmful effects of electrical light and LED light, which can interfere with your daily routine, which can lead to sleep difficulties.
The Livingston 1-0 Rangers Menga defeated Ferrard’s men in one article.
The Langers also encountered a problem while playing while Dolly Menga hit Steven Gerrad with one point on the egg (1-0) at Livingston.
The Ibrax's side of the Ibrax was the first to go on the way after St Johnstone was beating 4-1 on February. But Gary Holt's team struck Gerrard for a second time in an 18 game, when he lost eight points except the running team in Ladbrokes Premiersshipsships, Hearts.
Menga received an article a few minutes in front of the Half-time and the Rangers players were not interested.
While the Rangers came down instead of the sixth, the Livingston increased to the third after which the Hibernian left her with one point.
And there are problems that still come to Langers after the Linsman was treated with head injuries after he was struck by a throw from the side of the players.
Ferrard has changed the players the number of times of accompanying Ayr in the game before the last of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt has continued with 11 of Livingstone’s same players who took the same point at the Hearts last week and has rejoiced at the way his team has struck its opponents in every way.
The Rangers controlled the game, but Livingstone did more while receiving the ball.
It should have played a score in the second minute while Menga player allows Scott Pittman to pass to the Allan McGregor's posts, but this inner player did not find them.
Keaghan Jacobs rejected a ball found by Craig Halket, but his partner, Alan Lithlow, was able to open it on later posts.
The Rangers did not get control but seemed more optimistic than beliefs about the third game before the last one.
Arredo Morelos feels that he should have found the peniten in the half hour mark as he and Steve Lawles clashed with each other but Steve Thomson ignored the complaints of this Colombian player.
The Langers had a chance to throw a ball near the fields before finishing the first stage of the game, but the acrobat who played the Ibrox Kim Kelly had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's.
When Livingstone received the first article in 34 minutes that he had difficulty finding, no one would deny that he truly deserved them without simply working at all.
Also the Langers who failed to prevent Jacobs ’ soccer.
Scott Arfield did not act like the Declan Gallagher who passed a ball on to Scott Robinson, who did not worry about making a success of Menga.
During the first few days of his life, he had a change of attitude, but one of his friends, Ryan Kent, turned it over to me and quickly gained access to Morelos but not without success.
But Livingston continued to make the sailing team to play what they wanted, and Lithgow and Halket were throwing the ball away again.
The Holt's group could get an article at the start of the game, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow put it on his head.
One recent Langersern Middleton adviser had another judgment call, as he met with Jacobs, but he also ignored Thomson.
Almanac: Geiger County Developer
And now this page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, some 136 years ago today, and ISSA ... the date scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of testing and measuring radiation, which was developed by this development of a device known as the Geiger County.
Since then, the Geiger County has also been used in pop culture as well, as shown in a 1950 film known as "Bells of Coldao," whose unconventionally interested players are scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
He says: “What’s that?"
Rogers: "It is the Geiger County, used to search for valuables.
When you put these things in your ears, you will hear the results of the Atomic Energy.
Evans: "Speak, it is real now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63th birthday.
But this reflection bearing his name will live on.
A new cancer vaccine teaches the body's muscles to ‘ see' heavy cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the body's muscles to ‘ see' heavy cells and kill them
Mammals teach the pancreas to view the complex cells as part of the treatment
The method involves releasing the cells of the body from the patient, then converting them into the bulb
So ‘ they can see' normal proteins in cancer and be restored to the body.
Tests produce promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One patient who received an invasive injection, which teaches the muscles to detect unusual cells in the body, saw ovarian cancer all over the next 18 months.
The method involves releasing cells from the body’s lymph nodes, converting them into laboratory until "see" normal proteins called HER2, and recombinating them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Center, based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a false vaccine."
HER2 'gives an interest in the growth of a different cancer." including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and stomach cancer, explained university teacher Bernzofsky.
The same method of removing the body cells from patients and "training" to search for cancer cells has worked on the upper level of leukamia.
Kane West has scaled Trump's Support for Talks, Carrying a pictured hat, after appearing in a SNL.
It Was Not Easy
The West did not get a set of support during the Saturday Light Live after the short end of the saying in praise of the American President Donald Trump and said you would join the election in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, who was called the Last Town song carrying a pocket - size album written by Make America Great, he made a speech against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"Many times when I talk to a white person when they say: "How can you love Trump? He is racially prejudiced"
And I'm saying, if I’m worried about race, I’d go long ago, that's what I'd say.
The SNL began its program with a video that shows Matt Damon’s funny testimony to Brett Kavanough before the Committee of the Justice Court on Sexual Harassment from Christine Blasey Ford.
Though not spread, the Western video is put in a chat room by the critic Chris Rock.
Needless to say, Rock has been trying to make fun of the video.
Also, West provokes the audience’s anger by encountering difficulties before entering about his hat.
"They have used me back.
They said, ‘ Don't enter there with the hat you are carrying.'
They have abused me!
They also said that I was in a wet state," says the Washington Examiner.
West adds: "You want to see a sink?" which means you will wear a "Superman's dress, for it means what I want to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try to show love.
His talks received no support from the public and the English staff, said Variety, and someone saying: "The whole set is quiet."
West is brought to the site of Ariana Grande, who lost her boyfriend, rap singer Mac Miller a few days ago.
West has confused many by singing the song I Love It, which, like Perrier Bottle, has worn.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA team, Candance Turner, who wrote to Twitter: "I’m talking to a very courageous person: I’RE DO NOT SUFFER."
And the programmeman Karen Hunter wrote to Twitter that she was just "having behaved as though she really isn't there and that's something strange."
"But I have decided not to pay someone (by buying his music or giving him support for his "softs") which I believe he is accepting and publishing harmful ideas to my community.
You are free.
So too," we added.
Before the program, this rapper informed his followers in Twitter that he had changed his name accordingly, saying that he is known as "Ne and West just now."
He is not the first singer to change his name and follow the steps of Diddy, known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rap singer, Soneop Dogg, has changed his name to Soneop Lion and the late opera singer of Prince who changed his name to sign.

A feature of the Game of Thrones Kit Harrington speaks of trying to make oneself a dangerous man

‘ What have we taught men as they grow older about the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that the telescope is responsible for the very problem of trying to make oneself a dangerous husband because of his male role models.
He adds: ‘ What is taught?
What is taught in television, and in the streets, that boys think it must be forced to become men?
What do I think is the most important question at this time?
Because there was clearly something wrong with our boys.
In this interview he agreed that he would never again play the film at the end of this coming summer, saying ‘ you have finished with wars and horses'.
Since November Kit will be outstanding in a stimulating film called Sam Sherpard's True West in the story of the producer of the show and his brother, who is a robber.
He believes that meeting Rose is a beautiful experience from the Game of Thrones.
"I have met my wife in this system, and thus has helped me to find my family and my life since now," says he.
Rose imitated Ygritte’s real - life boyfriend, Jon Snow, who imitated Kit, in this popular soap opera.
The couple were married in June 2018 in the home of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDSs: China reports an increase in 14% of new patients.
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 82,000 people were affected in the country, says medical authorities.
An estimated 40,000 people are infected in the first quarter of 2018 alone.
In many cases people are sexually affected, far more so than they were used to.
Generally, many people in China are affected by blood transfusions.
But when the number of people affected in this way has been reduced to a complete drop, health officials in China say so at the Yunnan conference.
Every year, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection is a real problem for the LGBT communities in China.
Homosexuality has no longer been a force in China since 1997, but discrimination against the LGBTs is said to be difficult.
Because this country has such negative views, research has made it clear that men who have sex with 70-90% will marry people.
In most cases the effects are created without adequate protection for sexual relations.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised access to HIV drugs as part of the strategy.
Maxine Waters rejected information about GoPs that has been issued by an employee indirectly, ‘ a heavy lie' and a ‘ non-profession. ’
American ambassador Maxine Waters on Saturday refutes the charges that one of his employees would add personal details of the Republican U.S.
According to the Los Angeles Democrat, these charges are advertised by experts and sites who take sides with them.
"False, False and False," says Waters in the report to Twitter.
According to reports the data issued are home addresses and phone numbers of these American network users. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hach, in Utah.
These details appeared on the Internet on Thursday, installed by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during the conference on the lack of self-control and the charges of misconduct of the High Court President Brett Kavanough.
After some time the notes were taken out, the necessors plied Kavanau with questions.
Web sites such as the Gateway Puldit and the Red State reported that the IP addresses indicate that the source of the data is from Waters' Office" and even published details of Waters' employee, says The Hill.
"These groundless charges are absolutely false," in addition the Waters.
"A member of my staff - put at risk because his personal information has been published because of these false charges that are not available - he has not been responsible for the removal of these details.
This groundless charge is absolutely false.
The Waters report received a quick criticism from the Internet, including the former secretary of the American President Arischer.
"This is a denial of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"That indicates that he does not have the degree of being a member of the Congregants.
When a person is falsely accused of a wrong course, he has no need to vent his anger.
He does not have to fight.
He does not have to ask the accuser’s motives.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer compares Waters' response to Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanough, who was accused of being so angry with the impact of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Republican test which is not sufficient for the selection of Waters within the year, also announces his opinion to Twitter.
"Great news if true," writes Twitter.
In his noise, the Waters said his office announced the "_right authorities and legal institutions on false charges.
We will see to it that suspects are revealed," adding, "and they will pay officially for their dangerous actions to my employees."
Johnny English Strokes Against - Rowan Atkinsos ’ defeatal dot
It is common for days to look at objects about Brexit when you watch an English-related show and the same thing as the old comedy and the old comical jigsaw of Johnny English - from 2003 and then returned in 2011 by the Johnny English Reborn.
Will this fascinating sight talk about the news that we can no longer sell to foreign countries?
The postmaster named Johnny English received his license to renew that name indicating that he was an indistinct for non - English observers.
It is the real work of the State that is the most powerful and uniquely automated, consists of the minorness of Cloauauau, Mr. Bean, and at least one boy singing the theme of the Chariots of Fire at the opening of London's Olimkikis in 2012.
He even became the world-known traveler and mysteryman Atkinson who ever imitated the television commercials of the Barclaycard, leaving the controversy where he went.
There is one or two dollars in this show.
I liked this time that Johnny English came to the helicopter wearing his forearms while he played his hat.
Atkinson's gift of a good sense of humor is interesting, but it is not strong compared with such heavy products as 007 and the Mission Amossin, which now include laughter.
These jokes are for children and not for adults, but in my defense the laughter of Johnny English does not seem to be a little more effective in comparison with Atkinson’s untroubled flashs while playing Bean
News on this show demonstrate that the English are in serious trouble
A Internet hacker has had an uncultivated entry to the web of the Internet, seeing the details of all the working English tricks, until it struck the job's trick - the relatively small role of Kevin Eldon.
These stories simply pass through a proud high official who is faced with the problem of being rejected as a politician: Emma Thompson is trying to do what is right as she plays Teresa May but the author of the fairy movie is not doing well when she writes it.
Counselors told him that like all traps are at risk, it is necessary to restore a retired person.
And that is what is said by the philosopher Johnny English himself, who has assumed the role of the school's principal, but gives courses of non-infected art, while English teaches in an unusual way what he is like in a career than in real times.
The English is returned to Whitehall and told of this emergency to meet her former former companion, Bough, who was played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is a married man, married to the captain of the submarine
This capable couple return to work, and meet the Ophelia Bulléveti, who is fed by Olga Karylenko.
At the same time, the top official believes a billion - piece of technology to solve the problems of English computers: wicked Jason Volts, played by Jake Lacy
The English and Bough started such a hurry: making themselves food suppliers, burning a French food chain; they started problems while boarding the Volta's rich boat; and English brings an attack while they refuse to use the Vartual Reality for the purpose of studying the inside of Volta's house.
Everything is done in the final sections, although interesting and exciting, rather than the television programs of children talking about all of this.
Normal.
As with all other fairs of Johnny English: Can I ask myself if this English mass - produced industry could give Ron Atkinson the right role to play in his ability?
The work force denies that it did plan for British citizens to work four days but paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s work team made a plan to get employees to work four days a week — but paid five days ’ wages.
The report says that the team requires company management to pay for the financial support provided by companies working for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) day.
This will allow employees to work on a three - day weekend but only for the same wage.
The sources say that this plan will be ‘ well fitted ’ with the economic thinking of this group as well as the country’s remuneration plan to take part in the
Turning to a four - day week provided support for the Trade Union Congress as an alternative for the employed to take part in economic change.
The upper source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: ‘ System tests are expected to be announced before the year ended.
‘ Not immediately, but the four-day working week is the ideal idea of this new economic class to be on the side of the staff and the business plan of the group.'
The task force was not the first to provide support for such an idea, and the Green Party made a four-day schedule while turning up the support for the election in 2017.
This program does not currently receive full support from the Labour Party, however.
A spokesman for the Service Team said: ‘ The four-day work week is not a group system and it is not something to consider.'
Assistant director John McDonnell used the previous week’s job conference to explain his opinion on the economics that help people.
Sir McDonnell says that he is determined to take the position of ‘ the rulers who don't want to be seen ’ and ‘ who are profiting' in big business.
This assistant officer's plan means that the operators on the water vendors do not receive their assignment as the job government could pay ‘ no pay off ’ that they do not do well.
He residualized his plan to put employees in management positions and to make a joint - owned wallet for the purpose of giving the employees 10 percent of the nongovernmental sectors to give them £500 dollars.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI can change their thinking
The FBI investigation of charges made by Judge Brett Kavanaugh delays the last ticket of his arrest to the High Court each week, and it raises the question of whether the results of the research of this institution can change the Republican spread to change their mind with the support they provide.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, journalist of "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republicn reconnaissance John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that could make them think.
Kennedy seemed to be able to talk better than her companion from South Carolina.
"No," says Kennedy.
"I'll enter the courtyard, and I'll speak to the judge Kavanaugh."
I called after this happened, after the charges were issued, I said, ‘ Have you done this? ’
She was calm, sure, fearless.
It seems, though, that Graham’s title could not change.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanough and will be forced to have a heavy whip," says.
Forrh. Ford, I don't know what was going on, but what I know: Brett has strongly denied these radios," in addition Graham, speaking to Chris Blyey Ford.
‘ And everyone who speaks of him can confirm these charges.
36 years
I don't see any change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York welcomes the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a musical remnant to sing along with a good purpose; to bring an end to poverty.
Now the event is old, and it welcomes tens of thousands of people in the Centre; Park not just to have fun with such features as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to inform them of the real purpose of the event to bring an end to severe poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a part of the Global Poverty Project, a world agency hoping to eliminate poverty by adding people who are responsible for combating it.
To get a free ticket to a party (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you must do a volunteer work such as writing an e - mail to the world director, calling on the telephone, or whatever means are necessary to inform other people of their purpose to end poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been at his 12 years of age?
Is it a good thing to give a free reception the right way to provide support - people feel they are making the difference by signing online protests or by putting the message in Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen reported that he has forgotten 19 million acts on its supporters, with varying objectives.
It said that these actions have helped to encourage the world’s leaders to make reports of commitments and financial policies over $37 will be responsible for the lives of these 2.25 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the team described 390 commitments and reports for their actions, with ten million dollars being spent.
The group claims that their income has helped nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of these commitments include The Power of Nutrition, which is a joint institution of the U.K for the purpose of "helping children grow to this extent," the agency promises to give Rwanda $35 million to help bring about malnutrition in that country after they received 4.70 copies from the Global Citizens.
‘ With the support of the UK government, for supporters, for the various national government and the global Citizens like you, we may be able to determine the injustice of malnutrition," says the representative of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, which tells multitudes of the event in London in April 2018.
The team said that after 5,000 actions asking the U.K to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the money to be paid for the problem, with The Power of Nutrition, which will help mothers and children provide food.
When they answer one of the most common questions asked on the Internet, "What makes you think we can get an end to serious poverty?"
The Global Citizen said: "It's a long and difficult way - sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But as a translation of human rights and the result of a struggle before us, we will succeed, for we are strong when we are with others.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe and others who will enjoy the New York annual party, will be welcomed by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
America can use water seeps to interfere with Russia’s supply of energy - the Secretary of the Community
America can find protection under the navy in order to prevent Russia from selling electrical power, including the Middle East, explains Internal Secretary of the United States, Ryan Zan Inse as The Washington Examiner.
Zinke has filed charges that Russia is responsible for Syria - where the government’s civil service has been organized to investigate new methods of electric power.
"I believe that their goal of being in the Middle East is to trade for other countries as Europe has done in Eastern Europe, in the South European stomach, says.
And, according to the officers, there are ways to cope with it.
"America has the power, by the navy, to make sure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that their power does not travel to the market, says this.
Zinke has been talking to those present at a event adopted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself "the voice of power operators" in America.
He then compared the way America had dealt with Russia and Iran, which says they have not changed.
"The economic choices in Iran and Russia, almost to raise prices and replace oil," says, while calling Russia for a single-power-based mine.
This report appears after Trump’s government made efforts to encourage exports of water to Europe, which are entering Russia’s new world, without cost to the people of Europe.
As a result, the officers of the Trump Government, including the American President Donald Trump, tried to stop Germany from supporting the work of the "adjustment" of the Nord Stream 2, according to Trump that the task has done to Germany the " captured" of Russia.
Russia has also claimed that this Nord Stream 2 billion - dollar tap will double the current one to 110 billion cubicmers, a good job beyond the economy.
Russia says that American opposition to the project has economic implications and that it is an example of poor competition.
"I believe that the forces should not be the power of the pressure, and buyers must be able to select the merchants," says Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the American Secretary of Power Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
America’s position in this situation has not been well accepted in Germany that has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading center of the industry, the Federal Institute of German Business (BDI), has requested that America move away from the EU systems of force and contracts about Germany and Russia.
"I have a big problem when the third country interrupts our power." says Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federal Trade Center (BDI) after a meeting with German Minister Angela Merket and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "you will seriously consider" to enter the national election in 2020, says the Massachusetts Network.

At the City Hall Hall Hall, Warren of Massachusetts, confident that he would join the election.
"It is now the time for the round people to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that, according to The Hill, there must be a high-platform lay person in high office.
"After November 6, I will be hard to consider the appointment of the President."
Warren spoke badly about President Donald Trump at the city hall, saying that his father "this country is in the wrong way.
‘ I am concerned more about what Donald Trump will do for our freedom, ’ he says.
Warren is known for criticizing Trump and his captors of the High Court, Brett Kavanough.
Writing to Twitter on Friday, Warren said that "we need the FBI research before we can vote."
Nevertheless, the votes issued on Thursday show that many Warren’s followers think that it was not a good idea to enter the election by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the people "thought" that the Massachusetts votes should not be incorporated into the election, according to votes from the Sub-polistic Research Center/Boston Globe Polll.
Thirty-two gave support to this idea.
These votes showed much support to the old coordinator Deval Patrick, by 38 percent supporting their appointment.
Other names of the Democrats mentioned about 2020 election include the former vice president Joe Biden and the Vermontene Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide accordingly in January, says the Associated Press.

He was arrested and accused of domestic violence and on Monday night
"What my son hears, what he hears again, I feel for other families who are dealing with the problems of PTSD and for other injuries our return troops. He tells those present at Trump's dedication in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The 18 American and D.C. government sectors provide support in rejecting the new legislation of the
Eighteen government departments and the Columbia region gave support to the new legislation that condemns the victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 sectors of government and the region have signed awards to provide support to one of the victims in need of security who defy this law, says NBC.
The full name of the defendant in this situation between Grace and Sessions of the American Civil Liberties Union made in August about the unexplained national legislation.
He said that his "companion with the sons of his violent friends" abused him, but the American officials denied his request for protection on July 20.
Arrested in Texas
Representatives of these government departments give Grace support to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are the most important sources of security in America, such as areas dealing with serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
This new policy about seeking safety in America brings with it the decision of 2014 made by the refugee board of complaints that allowed refugees from domestic violence to gain protection.
Columbia General Karl Racine reported on Friday that the new legislation "responsives the old rules of state, national and international legislation"
"National legislation requires all requests for shelter to be considered in terms of the application, and this rule will end," states a court-in-law.
The lawyers also say that this law for preventing runaways from entering America is damaging the American economy, saying that they can be a businessman and perform necessary tasks.
General Jeff Sessions has issued a law to the judges that refugees should be given protection if they escape domestic violence or gang violence from June.
"Security will be found for anyone who has left home because of persecution or because he is concerned about race, religion, or political opinion," said Families on June 11.
Security was not made to deal with all the problems - I mean the most difficult -- people face them daily throughout the world.

The American ambassador accuses China of ‘ exploiting ’ using ‘ false advertising'
A week after the Chinese official newspaper made a four - page advertisement published in an American newspaper on the benefits of American and Chinese trade, an American representative in China accuses the country of resorting to the American news service.
American president Donald Trump talked on the Chinese daily for the Desmoines Register - Iowa’s best - selling newspaper of Iowa -ma to accuse China of its purpose of interfering with the purity of November 6, which is the lie that China lies.
Trump’s charge that China is trying to interfere with the choice is what American officials tell Reuters that a new part of the ongoing campaign for America to exert pressure on China.
Even though governments of different countries are often able to supply commercials to promote trade, China and America are currently at war with commerce and with increasing prices.
China has increased prices at the beginning of the commercial crisis and is designed to affect foreign suppliers on government stamps such as Iowa, who support the Trump of the Republic, says Chinese and American experts.
The Terry Brenstad, an American representative in China and the former governor of Iowa, selling a large portion of China's food crops, said that China has damaged American employees, farmers and businesses.
China, Brandon wrote his opinion on the Des Moines Register, "is now determined to exploit us by putting false ads in our free newspapers."
‘ In spreading false news, the Chinese government is risking the American public hearing using its usual custom of free speech and free and free publicity for the Des Moines Register," writes Brandon.
"In contrast, in the news media here at Beijing when you go down the platform, you will find little different opinions and will not see how the Chinese really think of the economic development in China, we think the news is under the Chinese communist party," writing.
He added that the "one of the most common newspapers has denied his request to publish this article" if he did not say where the newspaper was.
Republicans chase the hardened people out before the final election of Kavanaug’s problem, warning observers
Like the high - ranking Republicans standing by the High Court’s hostage Brett Kavanaugh and protecting him from his charges of sexual abuse, the analysts say they will see the ugly bubbles, especially in the middle - aged people, at this future election of the first half.
Feelings about this situation have been more intense, and the Republicans have again said that they want to continue the election.
You can't go back," says Grant Reeher, a university professor of physics at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, telling The Hill when an article was published on Saturday.
Reeher suggests that the last time you are wondering about the last attempt of the Jeff Flake (R-Arinini) to start the FBI research if it can change the thinking of the angry voters.
"The people who are stuck will not quickly forget what happened tomorrow - will be tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and public speaker of the Moveon movement on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters again said, "Come on November!" walking on the stage of the paint as the Republicans controlled the Justice Committee and decided to continue the capture of Kavanough despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
‘ He's interested in freedom and comfort is much," says Stu Rothenberg the neutral observer, informing the news center.
"People have begun to say that you are at the top of the world now, that is true.
But there may be more than this, especially for people who have not yet made a decision about whom they will vote and who are young votes, who are 18-2 years old, who are not interested in the president but are not normally free to vote.
Even prior to Ford's public testimony that he stated his charges against the High Court’s victims of sexual abuse, critics said that there can be negative results when the Republicans require proof.
"This has turned into a problem with the GoP," says Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republic National Committee last week when it begins, according to the NBC News.
"It isn't important for a committee ticket or last vote or if Kavanaugh enters the mainline, about how the Republicans cope with the situation and how they handle the machine," reports Guy Cecil in this news agency, the administrator of the Pretorias USA, a team that assists the Democratic
Even so, the United States seems to be unaware of whose faith between the Ford and the Kavanaugh testimony, although there are only a few others taking part in the latter.
Forty percent of the participants in one survey indicated that they probably believe or believe entirely the evidence of Ford, while 35 percent indicated that they may believe either fully or fully believe the case of Nanaugus.
In addition, 38 percent of those who thought that Kavanough could happen or are sure that he was lying when he gave a witness, at the same time only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake’s interest was aroused, the FBI investigated the charges brought against him by Ford and another devil, Deborah Ramires, The Guardian.
Ford has spoken out the testimony before the trial committee the previous week that Kavanaugh sexually abused him in 18 when he was drunk by Kavanuagh.
Ramirez accuses that the hostage of the Supreme Court revealed his private parts to him when they had a conversation while they were studying at Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
The Internet designer plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an Internet producer, is embarking on a new business with the aim of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This scientific color has a new Inrupt system, a industry that produces Solid is a system available to anyone.
The Solid allows its users to determine the location and location of their information and to determine who is authorized to see the details.
In an interview with the Fast Company, Bernards-Lee has discussed the purpose of the Inrupt as "World Power."
"We must do it now," he speaks of this business.
"A moment to forget"
This system in technology will allow people to make their own "division library" or POD.
It can include a list of telephone numbers, a list of things you have to do, a calendar, your music as well as other personal and job items.
It is like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black and Spotify in the same place at the same time.
Different from this storage area is the choice of the user as to what one is aware of.
This company calls it "a personal identification."
The Inrupt plan, according to the senior business officer John Bruce, to bring up the equipment, systems and abilities that are consistent to make the Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a system purchased by IBM, the development staff and the volunteer production society.
From this week’s beginning, the world’s technology industry can develop a single - design system that all of them use on the Internet.
Bernards-Lee said that he and his group spoke of "Facebook" and Goodle about whether he and Goodle made major changes that would cause their business to end immediately.
"We will not ask their permission."
"Berers-Lee said when writing to Mediium on Saturday that the purpose of Inrupt was to ‘ provide an interest in businesses and areas which would help to protect the integrity and standard of the new Internet made by Solid.'
In 1994, Bernards-Lee changed Internet while creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In later months, Bernards-Lee is an influential voice in the Internet discussion.
When the Irupt is officially opened, Bernards-Lee is still the creator and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Center and the Open Data Center.
"I’m happy over this new part of the Internet," in addition Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victoriaros pastor at WW1
The first and last week to receive the Victoria Cross during the World War.
Lt. Col. Cardinal Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 while the attack at Ballengise and Lehaucourt was carried.
At any rate, he was killed by a long - range catfighter and died knowing that he would receive Britain’s highest prize in four days.
A monument was opened by his two great - grandchildren in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his great - grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the stone is not easily forgotten because it was displayed 100 years after his grandfather won the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Vann paid his subordinate men to pass the Canal de Saint-Quentin "a heavy fog and were shot with heavy guns and machine guns."
Later he fled to those who were shooting and bravely took the big guns and machine guns alone.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German who had a long - range cat's shoulder on October 4, 1918 - more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his grandfather's actions are "a thing he doesn't know he can't do but said it's humble."
He and his brother Dr James Vann recorded a history made of a circle after the Brenwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says that he feels that he has a "respectable" as he has played a part in the journey, adding that the "real hero's courage will be displayed by many people who give support."

Now, don’t go to bed because you want to see Bellator 206 just to meet and not play it.
San Jose's policy has already had 13 wars, including six that have been spread at night on the UK Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., at this time Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald, UK's spectators were surprised to see the change in Peppa Pig.
Some are embarrassed like this and stay out all night until morning to see the battle.
Another follower described this change as playing animation as a bad joke
"The government’s rule if since 6 o'clock in the morning the procedure was no longer appropriate, so they had to change and put on the children's non-exploitation, "So says the vice president of the ads and communications for Bellator, when asked about what happened.
"Upepa the pig," yes.
Bellator Scott Cooker said that they would change their times next so that the UK's observers also watch.
When I think of playing it again, I think it would be possible," says Coker,
"It's a problem if it's six o'clock on Sunday morning, we're not going to be able to do this until Sunday by ours on Mondays.
But we come with a plan.
I believe, when it changed by the more instruction and all were not very happy.
When we tried to correct the situation, we thought our problem was our machine’s problem.
But otherwise, it was a State problem.
I promise you never again.
We are going to reduce the wars to five rather than the x - as - a - and - try to bring beyond their expectations but we have done more.

Desert Island Disc: Tom Daley feels ‘ a little less ’ because of his sex
The Olympic Mariner Tom Daley says that he has grown smaller because of his sexual appearance - but has given him the interest in winning.
This 24 - year - old tells me when I am going to second school that I am ‘ not like other people. ’
Speaking of the first Desert Island Discs run by Lauren Laverne in Radio 4, he says that he spoke about the rights of homosexual people to give them "hope."
He said that being a parent would lead him to no longer be concerned about winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the typical director of this program, has been sick for months.
To appear as a person condemned in the first Laverne system, Daley said that he felt that he was the least of them as he grew up because it was not allowed to love boys and girls.
He said: "Up to this day, feelings of shortness and dissimilarity, are the things that gave me the interest and strength to succeed."
He wanted to show himself to be "something," that he said, so that everyone would not be ashamed when they found out about his sexual nature.
This winner who won the two bronze Olympics has publicly declared the LGBTs and has used his reputation this year for the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to make a more legal settlement.
She said that she felt she was fortunate to be able to live without having to face problems and want to give others "hope."
This world winner three times claimed to date another man - American Movie producer in 2013 - "I didn't expect to."
Daley married the Oscar Conqueror, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but he said that the space between them was not a problem.
"When faced with such things as the youth" - to her first Olympics at 14 years of age and her father died from cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had the same problems of life.
This couple, who are parents in June, had a son whom they called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Stanley says ‘ all his mind' has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I would want you to ‘ get a gold medal,' says.
"You know, there are great things to finish the Golden Companies.
My gold bar, Robbie.
Her son has the same name as that of his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
During one of his final attempts, he asked whether he had any of the national tickets in London, as best he could afford.
I could not say, ‘ You' won't be in the front of the table," he said.
"I would hold him in my hand when he had finished breathing, and I saw after he had no breath at all that he could not remain forever," he said.
The following year Stanley competed in the operas of 2012 and obtained a bronze pole.
‘ I immediately realized that this was what I had always dreamed of — to splash in the water in front of the crowd in the Olympic game, I could not feel any better, ’ he said.
It also caught her interest in saying her first proud, a song by Heather Small - that had always captured her attention before an admiral, and it frightened her.
The Desert Island Discs is discovered in BBC Radio 4 on Sunday 11:15 BST.
Mickelson in the form of a play is put in a band in the Ryder Cup game on Saturday.
The American named Phil Mickelson will make a new record on Sunday in playing his 47th - anniversary drama, but he has to change the way he plays so that he does not make this uncomfortable record.
Mickkelson, who plays the event twice a year on the 12th, is put on the lap by Captain Jim Furyk on a 4-ball game with 4 people.
Instead of being watched by the crowds, as is the custom in playing America, the winner has spent half of his day not to play and has trained himself for the purpose of correcting the problem.
He is not able to play well, even though he is at the top of the game, the 84 - year - old player is poorly suited for playing in the Le Golf National, where the lawnch is available and is difficult for players to hit the ball.
If the playing field itself is frightening, Mickelson, at the ninth Sunday, is faced by Francesco Molinari, who is the best defender of the British Open, who has collaborated with Tommy Fleetwood who is still in school to win all their games this week.
If the Americans, are less than 4 points. If they can properly start 12 single games, Mickelson's game will be more important than that.
Fryk has expressed confidence in her husband as expected.
"You fully understood her role today, and you struck me a little back with the arm and said she would be ready tomorrow."
"You have real confidence in yourself.
You have found the site of a famous hall and have added much to this group in the past time, and this week.
I never thought he would play two games.
I thought she would play more games than she did, but she never gave up on me.
He wants people to know him, like everyone else.
Mickelson will pass the Mick Faldo record to play many games in the Ryder Cup game.
He may decide to play on the Ryder Cup that does not differ from his personal record.
Mickkelson won 18 times, was defeated 20 times, had a serious, and had Furryk said that his presence had brought about unseen realities in this group.
"You're fun, you have comical jokes, you respond quickly, you like to make fun of people, and you're a good person to be with you in the gang room" to explain.
"I was pleased to see young players laughing about him this week."
She offers much more than just fun.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that rapid advancement may be lost
Thomas Bjorn, European president, knows that we can lose a position of prominence as a number are still in the front of the Ryder Cup but that can change at any time.
The show started in 1997 in Valderama, where the case paid by the Sve Balles was five points ahead of America but was laid in the latter, winning in 141 11⁄2-131.2.
"You will tell yourself that you have many articles in Valderama; you have many articles in Brookline, where it is built and Valderma, where we won, difficult, on the station Bjorn, which is pictured, after viewing the 2018 school victory on 5-3 Friday and yesterday the 10-6 points of the Le Golf National.
History will therefore teach me and everyone in the group if you have not finished this course.
We will pour out all we have for tomorrow.
We will do all we can.
This has not been completed until the points on the board are reached.
Our goal is to overcome it, to gain the mastery over it.
Again I've said, I'm focusing on the 12 players on my side, but we know that we’re looking at any one side of the other side of the world.
Excited at how his players played in this difficult play, Bjor added: "I didn't really think of this.
The next day we will have to say something different.
The next day a personal play skill is checked, and that's the opposite.
It's easy to have a mate here when things are going well, but when you’re alone, you begin to be tested as a risk player.
That is a message that all players are forced to find, and they must show themselves tomorrow.
Now, you don't come with your mate, she must also go out again.
In contrast with Benjorn, the man on the other hand should be looking for his players to play well alone and not as a team, except for Jordan Apeth and Justin Thomas, who received three points.
Fryk was once the two sides of the last day's revolutions, she was on the side of the Brookline when she gained victory and in sub-divided as Europe did the "miracle at Medinah."
"I remember everything he said," in reply Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999, how did he put interest in them when they were going to the last day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but you're not supposed to keep that in mind as you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
Every time you start winning, it puts the stress on a ski game.
We organize our players according to order and put them in a way that will have good results, you know, we want to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to pay military recombination and face Rory McIlroy in the upper drama, facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulterurhu in the upper deck.
"I go with this group of men with this plan because I think he is facing everything," says Bjorn in this personal choice.
The German warship has been launched back.
A new German ship should not be released in 2014 to take the place of the warship known as the Old War, but the following year it will not be released because of the problems of the ship and the cost, says the report.
The release of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," a new ship developed by Baden-Wutterberg-class frigates, is postponed by the first half of the 1920s, according to the newspaper Die Zeit says the military spokesman.
The ship should not have joined the navy in 105, but the arrival of goods has made it possible.
The four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg in 2007 and will replace the Bremen ships.
It has been known that there will be a large armament, as well as anti-aircraft and other technology that made it invisible to the Radar, infrared and ascoustics.
Also important if it takes a long time before it needs repair - it can go for two years away from home.
However, continued disturbances make these new ships - said to give Germany strength across-and out of time when they are launched.
This naval vessel was published in the news last year, while the German Navy was against the necessary discharge of the ship back to Blom & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned the ship to the ship's bow after being brought in.
Little is known about the reasons for the ship’s return, but the German newsman claims that there have been problems with "electric" and goods, which make the ship more efficient, which has made the ship useless during the war.
The machinery is much more efficient as the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships are used by 120 to half the people who are forced to use the old Bremen.
Also, it seems that the ship is too heavy to reduce her ability and that the navy will not be able to improve it in the future.
This 7,000-ton ship is believed to be two times more survived than the ships such as were used by Germans during the second world war.
Despite unemployment, the costs of all this work as well as the educational costs that are employed to use it are now becoming a problem.
It is said to be estimated to be about £3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - from #22.2 billion
The problems of the new ships were important when it was shown that the strength of the German Navy is on the decline.
Early this year, Hans- Peter Bartels, the German Security Committee, admitted that the navy is ‘ losing warships.'
The officer says that the problem has grown older as the years of suspicion continue, since old ships have been discharged from the army but no new installations.
He then said that no other ship in the Baden-Wuerttemberg had been able to join the navy.
The New Trust Listens to stories of flying creatures such as rats
A new study conducted in the Scottish Highlands seeks to explain how these animals use their natural environment to obtain food.
It is hoped that the results will provide some insight into the behavior of these animals and how they can be protected.
This research by Scotland's National Trust scientists will follow these familiar animals, making a noise like that of the soprano, with long ears and Daubentons at the Invewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording machines will be placed in the most important position in this area so as to show what they do during the time of the year.
NHS's staff and volunteers will perform a survey with handheld machines.
Sound experts will check the record to show what the animals call them and what they do.
A map of these animals and a report will be made to give a picture of the behavior of the animals.
Rob Dewar, an environmental conservationist of NTS, hopes that the results will be that seeing the arrival of these animals will be a favorite place and whatever types of facilities are used.
These details will help you determine the benefits of protecting pets and how we can conserve wildlife.
The presence of animals in Scotland and the UK has declined a hundred years ago.
They are at risk because of the construction and development of habitats.
Turnines and light may put these animals at risk as well as flying papers and chemicals from buildings, as well as attack by cats.
These animals are not blind.
Even so, the demand for food from the day’s food forces its ears more frequently than its own eyes when it comes to handling food.
They receive food in anger when they return to their ears with their eyes fixed on the focus.
The NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 older areas, 38 important gardens and 66,000 acres [76,000 ha] of the country, assume that these animals are important.
It consists of ten trained experts, reexamining them, reconserving their living quarters, and sometimes rescues.
The center has created an exhibit in Scotland only at Threave on Dumfries and Galloway, with eight species of animals
Regional Director David Thompson says that this place is a suitable place for them.
"Here in Three we have a good place for these animals," he says.
"We have old places, old trees and beautiful living quarters.
There is a lot of knowledge about animals that is unknown to man, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us explain what they need to live."
He says that the value of testing these animals before you take care of them is important, since an accident in a child’s environment can cause the death of 400 children and diarrhoea, which can complete the rest of that type of activity.
These animals are safe and illegal to kill, interfere with, and take advantage of them and their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of Scotland's Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to know about these animals, and there are many of them we don't know how many of them are."
Ronalo has rejected charges of embezzlement and his representatives have come to destroy a German magazine
Cristiano Rolando has called the rape charges false, claiming that people want to make a name for themselves.
His lawyers will destroy the German news service Der Spiegel, which accounts for these charges.
Portugal and Juventas are accused of raping the American pauper, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in 2009
He is said to have paid $37,000 for saying nothing about the event, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
Regarding the Istalgram which spread to his 142 million followers after just a few hours of these charges were made, Ronaldo, 33 years old, has dismissed them as "false".
"No, only, no, only, no.
What they have said today, the lies at all," the winner of the Ballon d'Or five times says to the camera.
"They sought to make themselves known to the people in my name.
It is normal.
They want to be known by my name, but it is now quite common.
I'm happy and just," add this player, laughing.
The lawyer for Ronalo said that they were prepared to destroy the Der Spiegel on these charges, which they called the "anonymous report of private life," according to Reuters.
lawyer Christian Schchertz says that this player needs to give up "the spiritual damage due to the abuse of personal rights in the past years."
The event is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a hotel in the Palms Hotel and Casino National Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a drinking club, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to go to the theater of the athlete, where he was raped in the back, according to paper placed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the event he was accused of being "a good man" "99 per cent of the problem is the percentage of one."
It has been said that it has convinced Ronaldo that the couple are sleeping together but that they have agreed.
Mayorga said that she went to the police station and took photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later they agreed to argue with each other outside the courts because she was afraid she would return and was afraid of being humiliated.
The 34 - year - old says he wants them back because what Ronalddo said hurts him.
Ronaldo was about to enter the Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the charges, and this year he went to the great Italian group Juventus for sale at £100 million
Brexit: UK will ‘ regret it forever' for the loss of automobile manufacturers
The UK "will regret it forever" if he loses his leading position in producing cars after Brexit, says technical secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was concerned that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that Britain could travel through the EU without a discussion it would stop for a while to develop at their firm in Burkinaston, near Derby.
"We need a combination," says Mr. Clark.
This car manufacturer from Japan said that the risk of slowing out of goods at the limit if there is no connection in Brexit would be completed.
The Brunaston product - producing Toyota Auris and Avensis - has produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of that package has been exported to the European Union.
"It is my risk that when Britain moves through the EU by the end of Mashi we will see the development stop at our development," says Marvin Cooke, the governor of Toyota in Burkiston.
Some UK auto manufacturers have expressed their fear of going through the EU without a combination of trade, including Honda, BMW and the Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says that it will shut off its Oxford Day production for a month after Brexit.
Serious anxiety about this may pose a risk to trade when there is no connection with Brexit.
The Toyota range is carried on by the "timetime" system, with motor vehicles coming every 37 minutes from UK and EU vendors for the purpose of producing cars for the sake of instant purchases.
If the UK is traveling through the EU without a connection on 29 March, there may be an interference in the border where the industry claims that there may be delays and inadequate clothing.
It is unlikely that Toyota will have enough clothing for her Derbyshire project, that is to say, and the product will stop.
Sir Clark said that Theresa's plan in May with the EU's relationship is ‘ designed not to be associated with this border check.'
"We need a connection. We want a very good combination to allow us to take up this time," telling Radio 4 BBC on the system called TODAY.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other producers explains that we need to continue where we were with the most effective development."
Toyota did not appear about how long the production will last, and she has warned over a long period of time that higher prices will reduce the ability to compete in time to finish the job.
Peter Tsoullavaris, who has worked for Brunaston for 24 years and in theUnite union, says that they are probably worried again. "The time I've used to know that when the work is gone will never come again"
The government spokesman says: "Tell us a reliable plan about future relations with the EU.
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting can be postponed, says the office of the president of America
The important Dalld Trump conference and the vice-General Conservative Rod Rosenstein may be postponed another week as the election of the high court Brett Kavanough continues, says the president.
Rosenstein undertook the career of special adviser Robert Mueller, who conducted a survey on Russian election, as well as a convention between Trump and Russia and disrupting the arm of the law by the president
The fact that Trump does not expel the general representative, endangering Mueller’s independence, has been the cause of many gossipings in Washington over the past months
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein said that he would wear a recording with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by correction 25
Rosenstein argued.
But on the last day she went to the White House, among the reports she was going to cancel.
Instead, meetings together
Trump said that he would ‘ not choose ’ to chase Royente, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a confrontation in the Comet of the Comete shearing Place where Kavanough and one of the detectives accused of sexual immorality, Dr Christine Blessey Ford, both of them gave evidence.
On Friday, Tump authorized a one - week FBI investigation on charges against Kavanough, which has further been called the complete Senate.
Trump news correspondent, Msz Sarah Sanders, appears in Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the conference at Rosenstein, he said: "The day that you were not used, otherwise this week, I saw that a week later all other things took place in the high court.
But I'll see and always like to keep yourpress updated.
Some researchers object: The Sanders did not drive the White House line since 10 September.
The nun Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the absence of explanations was not due to the disturbances of TV commercials, although he said: "I would not agree with their observation."
He suggested that contact directly between Trump and raisepress.
"The president created the Q&A sessions and sessions rather than any president before," he added without counting: "We check those numbers.
The reports are going to take place, said Sanders, but "if the printer has the opportunity to ask the American president questions directly, it is better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do so and have seen that we do much in the last few weeks and will take the place of the printing commentary if you can talk to the U.S. president.
Trump always collects questions when you leave the White House or participate in open sessions or connect to seminars and interlaced sentences.
Solo news conferences are a disaster.
In New York this week the president may have indicated why, in New York, he made a freeheeling and other invisible periods before meeting the news.
The health secretary is writing to the EU staff in NHS Scotland about Brexit fear
The Secretary of Health wrote the EU staff of Scotland to the NHS to express their national thanks and wish to stay in Post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP has sent a letter in less than six months to the remote UK to withdraw it from the EU.
The government of Scotland has dedicated themselves to meeting the cost of EU applications for community services.
In his letter, Nsz Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the discussions between the UK and the EU on the move have continued, focusing on the expected decisions in the fall.
But the UK Government has set up its plans about an unlikely situation.
I know this should be the most disturbing thing all of you.
That is why I would like to once again to value the contribution of the whole crew, regardless of country.
The brothers from all over the EU, and more, bring important experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health, and benefit the patients and the people we are using.
Skotland is your living place and we want you to stay here.
Abercrombie Cysby Ingoes Surgery Emergency After Showing Shepherding Injury
The Tennessee State Backer Chrisy Abercrombie was elected immediately after the attack of the head on Saturday 3127 in Vanderbilt Commodores, as reported by Mike Organ.
The State’s Prime Minister Rust Reed has told the press that it is possible to be injured in a short time.
"He reached the side line and fell down," says Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel offer Abercrombie oxygen in a pre-laying and retesting course.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was not opened to Vanderbilly Medical Centre.
Harris added that there is no "knowledge of the type/ size of the present injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine if injury occurs.
Abercrobie, redshirt sophomore (Nuoror at the University, but only in their 2th year of playing college), the first vacation with the state of Tennessee after being transferred to Illinois.
She had five officers on Saturday before she left the game, bringing her full time to 18 problems.
Salesmen will be paid when they buy the UK property
Foreign buyers will be paid when they buy the UK property and additional money used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
The rise will reduce Corbyn’s success in driving to attract lower votes.
The increase in the work of the stamp will be paid by those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Fund is expected to be raised to £20 million a year to assist the homeless.
Salesmen are used to be paid at the highest rate of the UK - and the extra money used for the homeless, Theresa May will bring today.
The increase will appear to be an attempt to reduce the effectiveness of the Jeremy Corbyn Drive to attract the youngest votes by pledges to provide the purchase of existing houses and to focus on gaining the upper class.
The increase in the work of the stamps will be paid by the people and non-taxes in the UK, as well as by the extra cost of improving Russia's sleep - fighting operations.
The increased fee for the current stamp work, including the high levels that were placed in two years ago in the two homes and the purchase and rent, may be about 30 percent.
The Fund is expected to increase to £ 120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new facilities built in London are purchased by the UK community, to drive prices and make it difficult for the first buyers to find foot at the level of the house.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly the capital - have become a ‘ rural community ’ because of the high number of foreign consumers who spend their time in the country.
A new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson asks that the stamp be removed for the benefit of new people with their homes.
He persecutes large firms in the construction of the high property costs by taking out the land but not using it, and he urged Nsz Mei to give up the platforms in the shopping homes to repair the British "house disgrace."
Sir Corbyn has brought up a list of improved house repair systems, including rent management and denouncing.
He also wants to provide many huge committees to build new homes.
Msz May said: "Last year I said I would give your Premiership to restore the British dream - if life would be better for each new generation.
And that means repairing our house - to - house market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to stay, work, and build life here.
Even so, it would not be possible for the UK blind people, as well as foreign - based companies, to buy home as hardworking British citizens.
For most people the dream of the homeowner has been a long way off, and the destruction of a painful sleep remains a reality.
Jack Ross: 'My top chest is controlling Scotland'
Sunderland Chief Jack Ross says that his "high desire" is to be the Scottish Captain at a certain stage.
Scotts, 42, explains the challenge of rebuilding the Northern-east league, currently occupying the third place in the League One, three put it up.
She moved to the Stadium of Light on this summer after leading St Mirren on the Premiership of the Scottish Season.
I want to play my country as an actress.
I have B bulls and could, "Ross told you the BBC Scotland Sports.
‘ But I grew up watching Scotland in Henden more and more like a child, and it is always my protection.
That opportunity will come, however, if I succeed in the management of the club.
Sunderland chiefs include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Canio
A former officer of the Alloa Athletic says that he did not have the courage to follow the cuts in a large workshop, which has already discarded parts from Barnsley and Ipswich City.
"Success for me at this time will be followed, 'May I return this journal to the Prime Minister League?'
Because of the construction and facilities for this game, no doubt in the Premier League, he said so.
"It's not easy to find it there, but probably I'll just see if I'm winning here if I'm going back there."
Ross only three years in his administrative role, after time as an assistant to Dumbarton and 15 days in Coachingstaff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the third entry, and changed St Mirren from the level of support at the Championship level in the following respect.
And Ross says he feels more at ease than at his play in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academy.
"It was possible to be real," remembering, by taking the Alloa.
"I really believe that the rule is good for me, more than to play.
It sounds so good because I did so well, made a good life there, and enjoyed it very much.
But playing can be a challenge.
There are many things you have to do each week.
I continue this way in terms of the stresses and pressures of the work, but the control feels right.
I always wanted to be in charge and now do it, feeling that I am free to be in my bag for the rest of my life.
You can listen to a full talk in Sports on Sunday, 30 September, and Radio Scotland between 12: 00 and 13:00 BST
The full time of the pin is 5.30pm on Saturday, the investigation sees it.
The summer form of heatwave has encouraged the removal of the heavy British bridges but more concentrated in the restaurants.
The Pub and Bar groups saw a sale of 2.7 percent in July - but taking in restaurants was 4.8 percent lower, indicated the number.
Peter Martin, of the consultancy system CGA, which included these figures, said: "The long continuity of the sun with England may be expected to take part in the Nulai World Cratel Crater and follow the same example last June, when the pubs rise by 2.8 percent, unless the restaurants are hard.
The loss of 1.8 percent in a merchant shop in June was greatly increased by July.
Drinking prosthesis and overloaded valves can be like a preference for more than low - table restaurants.
Food- headed pubs were also destroyed by the sun, although they are not just as moderate as food drivers.
It seems that people want to get out of alcohol.
In all the pubs handled and the alcohol bars were over 6.6 percent per month, with 3 per cent diet.
Paul Newman, entertainment analysts and visitors, RSM says: "These effects continue with the air we have seen since April.
Weather and the effects of major social or sports events are always the main priorities when it comes to exporting in foreign markets.
Not surprisingly, shopping groups continue to fight, although the increase in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly painful at the costs of the ongoing costs.
The long-burning summer did not come at a very bad time for the leading drivers of food and time will mean that the temperatures taken by August will give more breathing.
The general increase in sales in pubs and stores, including a new opening, was 2.7 percent in July, showing a improvement in brand outs.
The Coffer Peach Tracker of the UK Pub, bar and food department restaurant collects and analyzes work data from 47 working groups, and combined prices of over 9 million, and a set medical model.

The research of 20,000 high school students showed the development of the "Insta" pages.
The news media have promoted the idea that sex is on the line.
Twenty percent of students say they have the "head" account to show their parents
One of five children - some as small as 11 - create social accounts for adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students has shown rapid growth in the "Instake Insta" account - referring to the Instaggram housing site.
The news media have raised fears that sexual themes are being transmitted.
Twenty percent of students report that they run a "particular" account to show their parents, when they are alone.
One mother who was upset in her 13-year-old daughter found a girl who touched others to "take me out."
Research, with the Digital Awareness UK and the Head of the Head of the Executive (HMC) of private schools, found 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 years of age, with two reports, and half of those who agreed to keep their records.
The HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: ‘ It is disturbing to many new people who are tempted to create online sites where parents and teachers can't find them.

The call for support of the pump by comparing mothers with cows to divide Internet opinion.
The pump company has divided the idea of selling online and advertising that describes young mothers from captured cattle.
To illustrate the development of what is called "the first breastble pump," Elvie's company of technology company released the theme of music-in-cheek an inspired video presentation to show the new freedom pump provides for mothers.
Four mothers have a dance in the new brows on the trails that include such sounds as: "Yes, I understand myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you didn't realize these things, it's not so."
Thechorus continues: "Pup it is out, pump it out, I feed the baby, pop it, pop it up, pop it up, and put my girls in it."
Nevertheless, an advertisement, printed on a file film, creates an online conflict.
In perceptions of 77,000 and hundreds of states, the video has received mixed answers from viewers, many say that it means the "disaster" of the milk industry.
"A good solution is used by the cows to announce this product.
As with us they have to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless their babies are aborted before the days of birth, "write another.
Elvie chest gun fits well inside the maintainer vessel (Elvie / mother).
Another said: "There is a clear concern for mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to publish pump to mothers who will keep their children?
One person added: "Unavoid in a market."
Others defend the announcement, one woman acknowledging that she has received a "clean" song.
‘ I think this is a human theory.
I’ll have one too if I fill it.
Mass pumping made me feel like an ox.
The announcement was a little hurtful, but I accepted it.
This is a product of the mind, "one wrote.
Another said: "This is a good advertisement directed to mothers who are pumped (usually in their workrooms or toilets) and feel like ‘ cattle.'
This is not a declaration that glorifies or judges the milk industry.
At the end of the video, a group of participants indicated that everyone was playing with the heavy pumps.
The theme after the campaign is based on the fact that many prominent women in the herd feel like cows.
Elvie Pamp, therefore, is completely silent, without wire or buses and is firmly in accordance with the wrapper, gives women freedom to walk, hold their children, and get out.
Ana Bararin, ECD's mate and ECD to Mother, said: "Elvie steam is such a vacancy product that was appropriate for the introduction of courage and touch.
By showing the similarity between women and milk cows we wanted to put the breasts down with all visible challenges, when it shows in a manner that is fun and that will look out for an empty freedom that will bring new freedom.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has made an accident.
During the Mondon week, the mother of two children appeared in the deigned cathilk catteler Martha Jabolowski while using this product.

The number of adopted children who have moved out of the way even though the moon's distances remain constant, because of the division that the strict control and control policies make it difficult to set up children and support.
Traditionally, many sponsors have become foreign, and they have threatened their capacity to stay in this country by further calling a child.
The danger increased in June, when the government authorities announced that the social support staff and other older members of their homes had to wear fingerprints, and if they were to be shared with the authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the senior committee and the Convention on the Move and Exportation of the Times, testified before the Conference that the Minister holds the majority of people who apply for the support of the children who are not involved.
The Minister later made sure that 70 percent of the officers had been arrested had no record of crime.
"Almost 80 percent of certain people are sponsors or family members of the country who support them illegally, and the large chank is the criminal foreigners.
So we continue to pursue such people, says Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the development of children, officials promise new laws that will require that others appear in court within a month of imprisonment, not long after 60 days, are the most early restrictions, in regard to the staff of the living room.
Many will appear in a telephone conference, rather than in the presence of a person, to defend their stand on the legal position of the immigration judge.
Those who are considered unworthy of freedom will soon be removed.
After a long stay in a cell, children can say that they can be anxious or depressed, which can lead to either a long - term outcome or a relapse, according to social workers as well as reports from the program in the months to come.
Advocates claim that this concern has been raised in a large institution such as Tornillo, where the child’s severe symptoms may be forced, because of its size.
They added that taking the children to a tent town without giving them enough time to prepare for themselves physically or to say that friends could repair much of the damage they suffered.

The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no restructuring in Syria until there is a political concordat between Assad and opposition to the end of war.
UN links say that the newly established agreement between Russia and Turkey to the level of the tampon for the great Idlible tower has given the opportunity to further with political speeches.
The Russian talk in Turkey launched an intense attack on the Russian healthy Russians, where three million people live.
The Mouleam but emphasized that the agreement "had come a long time" and expressed the hope that the military participation will focus on the quadrants, including the Al-Qaeda-nearmen with the Nusra Front, "will be destroyed."
The UN messenger Staffan de Missura hopes that he will soon join the first meetings of a new committee organized by the board of government and opposition to form a Syrian military constitution and to pass the choice course.
Mouleam presented conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee, which said that the function of the panels should be prevented from "recognition of the articles of the current constitution," and warned of disturbances.

He then led them to a large section of the race as he held on to his tires so that he could speed up the course and take Kim Raikkonen the fourth one.
Finally he entered the mines on page 44 but was unable to speed up the remaining eight stages as Raikkonen took the fourth.
It is a difficult day because Valtter had a good work assignment for a week and was a man who told me to let me go.
The crew has done a unique job to have a pair, "Hamilton said.
The crew did no parting work to be the second, "Hamilton said.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting because he did not break the letter from Christine Blasey Ford critically denouncing High Court president Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
Speaking at a West Virginia conference, the president did not clearly mention the evidence provided by Foeyi before the Council of the Court of Courts, instead of focusing on what happened in Senate shows that people were "speaking and stimulating and strong."
One thing that can happen and a good thing is going on in the last few days in Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are hot and talking and talking and talking and not talking, "He said.
"When you check for leaks and leaks and they say "oh, I haven't done it.
I didn't do it.
Do You Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, is he playing?
Remember his answer ... Do you break the volume -o, what?
Oh not.
I didn't wake up.
Yes, wait a minute.
Is it equal to ... No, we didn't go out, "in addition, to the level of the mankindator.
Feinstein sent a letter writing about Kavanough by Fordon in July, and he had lived early September - but Feinstein rarely that the leaks came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's reports, I never broke his story, "Feinstein told the committee, the Hill reported.
"He asked me to hold it secretly and kept it secret as he asked.
But his denial did not seem to fit in with the president, who said about Saturday night: ‘ I’m going to tell you, that was very bad physically.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst type of body I had seen.
To further protect the President of the Supreme Court, accused of sexual immorality by three women, the president stated that Democratics are used for their sentences.
They are determined to restore power in any way necessary.
You see the meaning, wrong, care not for who is doing the wrong, who must work to assume power and control, "Mediaite reported the president.

Another black man !!
NINny suite two after a shot after the word "racial"
The New York Nanny states a couple quoted after they received an incorrect text from my mother complaining that she is ‘ another black person.'
This couple disagrees that they are not partial, comparing the suit to "roup."
Lysey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed concern when he learned that the new child service provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when he arrived on his first day of work in 2016.
" NO ONE SON," wrote Nsz Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the quotation.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Nsz Maurice, two.
After recognizing her own watch, the "freeness" Plasco-Flaxman was dismissed by Nsz Maurice, whose exitnny, who was an American, had done a bad job and instead of waiting for the Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Msz Maurice was paid for the project one day and returned home in Uber.
Now, Maurice corrects the couple for compensation, and he seeks compensation for $350 a day for six months, the gig at the first, if there is no agreement.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such things," he told the mail on Friday, adding "I know you're against."
The couple accused him of being racially prejudiced, saying that it was reasonable to leave his work, fearing that they could trust him after they had provoked him.
"My wife has sent her what she doesn't like to say.
He is not a nation.
We are not racial people, "Jeel Plasco told the Post.
"Would you put your children into the hands of someone who has been quick, although it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come."
To compare the suit to "contemption," Plasco said his wife was only two months old if she had a child and was "hard."
"Will you follow such a man?
That is not the best thing to do, the "Bowing bank is added.

The publishers in Paddington were afraid that students would not agree with the ball, a new book showing
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said: ‘ It is difficult to put it on the shoes of the person who reads it for the first time before it is printed.
I am amazed now that we know about great success in Paddington.
He says that his father, who served as BBC Cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small Bible, would be a rare man about his banned work, adding that the book was a good one for 60 years after his death last year.
In Paddington, he described as "the most important member of the family," and added his father was automatically dependent on his success.
"He was an older man, and was not a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington was true to her, it was difficult for her to have a child who is perfect: she is proud of it though not necessarily.
I think he had observed Paddington’s success that way.
Although he was his creation and thought, he always owed him a debt to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to whisper her over the phone
Her daughter was rushed to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors were working idly to save her life.
"Nad always called it wrong, if he didn't expect him to do it," said Mrss Ednan-Laperouse.
"After that I received a call from Nad if he said he would die between two minutes and I had to tell him.
And I’m not fooling myself.
I said, "Tash, I love you very much."
I will be with you soon.
I’ll be a better person.
Doctors had prescribed her to keep her heart beating faster and she left her system.
He had no time in front of his hand, and this was all closed.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all of that was coming from me.
I could not cry or cry or cry because I was put in the atmosphere around families and people.
I had to hold together.
Finally Sir Edna-Laperouse, now grieved by the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who were unaware of her problem.
"No one knew," he said.
"I was touched by my head, and tears were always known.
It is hard to explain, but it was in this atmosphere that I felt such a kind gesture toward Nad.
If he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Archaeologists who issued suicide cards on the draw
Two women who have lost a loved one in death try to save their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards to the Welsh Bridge as well as encouraging messages and telephone numbers to call for support.
Mrsz Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to experience depression and suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as I would feel every day," he said.
Msz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that his son was a promising cook with an affected disease.
"Everyone knew us because of his smile.
They were always talking about his smile.
Even so, he quit the job before he died, as he was ‘ in a dark place.'
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who could have his brother after he was alive.
Msz Davis said: "I always complain that there will be a knock."
Ms Davis created cards, "Let people know that there are people outside where you can talk to them, even if you are friends.
Don't keep quiet - you have to talk.
Msz Humphreys, who has been a friend for years with Mrs Davies, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after Mother's death.
‘ Not that he was feeling low or depressed or anything,' he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed her change in attitude.
She was on the lowest stage in Christmas when children opened up their gifts and didn't join her in anything.
He said that his death was a great victim to them, but they should work with him: "He boasts a hole in the family.
Throws it out

The future of Brett Kavanough depends on the registration as the FBI initiates research
"I thought, if we could find something like what it asked at a time, it is limited to space - perhaps we enter a little unity," says Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was running away from the committee "divided between the gridlocks.
Why do Mr Kavanau and his allies in the Republic want the FBI to search?
Their lack of desire is due to time.
The election of the latter five weeks, on November 6 - if, as is expected, the Librarians do wrong, so they will be very weak in their efforts to find a man they want to be elected to the highest court on earth.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senators, asking to support Mr Kavanough, who worked in the West by Mr Bush and met with his wife Ashley, who was the secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI published its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where the Republic and Democratics now sit.
It is not clear that Mr Kavanaugh can reach 50 votes on the level of Senate, which will allow Mike Pance, the president, to break the case and convince him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's zoom number 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korea's authorities to South Korea has fallen from Kim Jong-un to power seven years ago, the South Korean representative said.
The Bayong-seug park, which mentions a scale from the South social service, said there was security of 1,127 last year - compared with 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that control cuts through the border between North Korea and China and the high levels paid by chief painters.
Pyongyny did not create public opinion.
Most of the orphans in the North are eventually donated by South Koreans.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have fallen illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled to China, the longest - line line in North Korea, and it is easy to cross the Dilitised Zone (DMZ) Valley between two Koreas.
China refers to the victims as illegal migrants rather than runaways and repeatedly return again and again.
The relationship between the North and the South - which has been legally active in the war has won too much in the months to come.
Earlier this month, the leaders of two countries met at Pyongyang with talks that were aimed at joint debate.
This occurred after a June history meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work on the uninterrupted Korean sub-counter.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Minister Ri Yong-ho says that the U.S. sentences are due to a lack of progress.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions, no way will we take advantage of it first," says Mr Ri in a speech at the National General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelos calls Brett Kavanough, saying that she is not prepared to serve in the Supreme Court.
The young Prince of the House, Nancy Pelos, called the High Court's highest person Brett Kavanough and said that he could not serve in the Supreme Court.
Peloic gave answers to a Saturday discussion at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if the woman had done such a thing, they'd be successful," Peso said about her reply to Kavanough to witness before the Council of Courts on Thursday.
The Kavanaugh had been officially permitted to smoke with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while young.
At opening up, Kavanau was very moody, sometimes screaming and joined in discussions about his family and his high - school years.
He judged clearly the democracy on the committee, calling for criticism on the "company of elements and man's organization" which has been organized by rare institutions if Hillary Clinton had lost the selection of 2016.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanough evidence that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, since it showed that he was being abused by the Democrats.
‘ I think you are ready for such comments and how the Clintons and Democratics are following, he said.
The Lord was emphasized when he was asked that he would try to disrupt the Kavanaugh if he was assured, and if the Democratics get more from the House of the Representatives.
"I'll mean this" if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress or FBI, so he shouldn't be the Supreme Court, but in the present court," Pesosi said.
Kavanaugh judge in D.C.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democracy he was concerned about the judgment of Kavanough Act or Roe v. long, as it is regarded as a retaining justice.
In his confirmation of the arrest, the Kavanaugh had answered questions about whether he could change certain of the Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for a person who is in danger, privately to go to court and wait for us to say, 'that' is not,' says Pelos.
And women want to protect it.
A good diatribe, a month and years of burning anger, and she cannot do it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrssz Steinem said to me 45 afterward.
"I don't think something strange, don't I?"
He went on to say, ‘ I was helped by a woman who was a lady who was a ruler in a certain place, who also cried when she cried, but who developed a system that meant that when she started to cry, she said to her partner, ‘ You think that I am sorry because I cry. ’
I'm angry.
And he kept walking.
And I thought there was an intelligence.
Tears are allowed to flow as a result of misunderstandings.
One of my more sharpest reminders than the first job, in a man-man-man-man-man-in-law, where I found myself crying in unutterable anger, was caught by an elderly woman in my neck - I’m always afraid - who gets me off the stage.
"Never let them see them crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think that you are sorry and that you will be glad that they come to you.
Patricia Schroeder, then the Democraticman Society in Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidentship.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in the open-decker of Monkey and came out of the race, Mrsz Schroeder, he was very concerned, he might think there was no reason for him to get the idea of running the president himself.
"There was no reasonable decision," she said to me by laughing after 30 years.
"There were seven heard in this contest, and the last thing they wanted was one.
One called the " Snow White and the Seven Favorite."
Because it was after the campaign, it was after financial support, and she vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost war.
He found that some of his supporters who paid 1,000 to the men would give him only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a break?" She wondered.
When his talk announced that he would not set up an official campaign, he was struck with emotion - toting thanks to the people who supported him, frustration and a system that made it more difficult to raise money and direct vote than messengers, as well as anger at position - if he was mature.
"You think I'm going to be disturbed," recalls Mrsz Schroeder about how the printer reacted to him.
"You think Kleenex was my company's sponsor.
I remember thinking, ‘ They will throw my stone on me? ’
"She cried"?
How the US-Y China War can be a beautiful sight at Beijing
The salvos opening of the war of trade between the US and China was deaf, and while the fighting is far away, conflicts between countries can be useful to Beijing for a long time, say experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, dismissed the first warning at the beginning of the year by charging foreign talks in Chinese, including solar panels, iron and aluminium.
The significant rise has been adjusted this week by the new fees affecting 200 billion (U.S.) that cost property, rightly by taxes for all US from China.
Beijing is re-renewed, tariffs have just paid a fever to ten per cent of America’s $60 million.
China has promised to identify US short-shot-shonet, and most of the world's economy will not be possible to combine any time in the near future.
To get Washington back means to take the demands, but to bow down to the United States will be too ashamed for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing can properly play its cards, the force of U.S. wars can certainly help China over a long period of time by reducing its dependence in other countries.
"The fact that the immediate political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions which begin to discard the country's economy is really more dangerous than observers have seen before," says Abigail Grace, a senior friend who is heading for Asia, says that the new American Security Culture, a thinking tank.

The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million of the country’s inhabitants need help.
"Al-Mauleam has said that the kingdom of Syria will receive help in rebuilding a ruined land.
But he stressed that they would not accept help with restrictions or help from the lands in which they provide it.
