Science now indicates that the carbon conomy has gone through a dilodja in the bosphere from one of its stable conditions that supported the changes in human society in the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the public and is using transport procedures. Virtually everyone complains about transport procedures.
In developed countries because at that time and at that time we hear similar complaints about the water level and the falling of bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers unable to work? Or could something more important be done?
Car travel is learned by means of each driver’s ride and car from one place to another and by the way he interacts with one another.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to learn the lost volume of motor vehicles because the driver's gear cannot be completely predicted.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave well within the appropriate list; but, of course, the courseways tend to be consistent and can be represented in mathematical terms.
To serve as a better guide for traffic travel, the link is established between the three main features: (1) travel, (2) pitch, and (3) speed.
This relationship contributes to the planning, operation, and operation of methods.
