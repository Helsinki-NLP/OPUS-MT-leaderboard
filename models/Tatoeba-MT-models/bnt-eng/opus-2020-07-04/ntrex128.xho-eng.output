Members of the Welsh Assembly (AMs) are concerned with looking foolish
There are fears of the AMs because it is raised to change the way it is called MWPs (A member of Wales Parliament).
This has been promoted because there are plans to change the name of the convention into Wales Parliament.
The AMs in all politics are concerned that this will cause them to be washed.
One AM of Labour says that his team is concerned that the new name is closer to the way it is called Twp" and "Pwp."
To a student who does not live in Wales: Welsh wp is a fool, and a pwps is a twp.
The AM of the Wales Society has said that the whole association is against this, and has advised in other terms.
A member of the Conservative in Wales says that his group has no problem with the change of word, but he has seen that it is not easy to call MWP in the way you call the fool.
In this case the way the letter is pronounced in Welsh is similar to the English alphabet.
The Assembly Commission, which is concerned with launching the policy of changing the name into this new one, has said: "The decision of how to call the Convention Members will be taken by the members of its own members."
The Government of Wales Act Act 2017 granted permission for the Welsh convention to change its name.
In June, the Commission has published the results of the response and has found that many support what is called the Council of Wales.
In the matter of calling the AMs, the Commission prefers this: Members of Wales Parliament or WMPs, but people support this MWP.
The AMs are said to offer alternative advice, but the difficulty in this matter must be a problem for Ellin Jones, the Executive Officer, who is expected to set a rule on changes in the coming weeks.
This amendment legislation will include other changes that will be changed, such as the operation of the convention, including the amS and the preparation of the committee.
It is the AMs vote that will end when the rule is discussed in the question of how they are called.
Macedonians will vote to change their country’s name
The votes will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
This vote is designed to resolve the long - standing conflict between Greece and the neighboring country of the province of Macedonia.
The Athenians have long claimed that the name of their neighbors in the north makes them appear to have a dispute in their area, and they have long opposed their request to be members of the EU and the NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjoge Ivanov, who was opposed to the revision of the name, said that he would not ignore the title.
However, supporters of this vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is the price to be paid to join EU and NATO.
St. Martin St. Martin was fired as They Draw Hard Churches in Harlem
Mr. Adams said: "The old men I have spoken with said there was a bar and a church everywhere."
"Today, none of them are."
You understand why the bills did not exist.
He said: "People are having fun another way" these days.
"Bari is no longer a place to live in a neighborhood where people go regularly."
You worry about the churches because you think the money they received from selling their goods will not last as long as the leaders think, "and soon they will return to their original condition."
It adds that the churches can be replaced by man - made banners that will never help preserve the local holy sites that remain.
He said: "Most people buy these plates from white people. So it will soon be too late for the day when the churches will be closed, because it does not appear that these people who move to these plates are members of these churches."
Both were white congregations before Harlem became a place of black people, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, in St. Martin ten years later.
The first white Methodist congregation was released in the 1930 ’ s.
The black congregation he served near had been built.
St. Martin was a black congregation under Death. John Howard Johnson, who led the merchant shop at 125th Street, the main street of the market at Harlem, was against the lack of employment and support of the blacks.
In 1939 this building was severely damaged by fire, but as the members of Tat' Johnson's members prepared to rebuild it, they were ordered to be beaten.
Nye. David Johnson, son and successor of Matthew at St. Martin's, affectionately called it the metal beat of the poor people.
The man who was a skilled blacksmith, and who used to strike himself, called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and“ a history tool which will never be taken away."
This scholar, Tiffany N of the University of Michigan, also says that it was the first time in the world that the instrument was played by black musicians Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the famous River Church 18 years ago.
M. Merweather said that St. Martin's was not replaced.
The main thing here in St. Martin's in the past few months was the architects and builders, some of whom were introduced by non-teachers, others by the Rabbis.
The church’s administrative body, made up of nonteachers in July, is concerned that the latter may be responsible for the congregation, although it did not share in the employment of the detailed architects and builders.
Some members complain that the bridle does not count things.
The shark injured a young child with 13-year-pounder to obtain lobsters in California
The officers, the shark, attacked and injured 13 boys on Saturdays, when immersed to catch lobster in California on the date when the time was opened for logster.
This attack occurs just before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in the Enchanitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help. They went to him to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first I thought it pleased to catch lobster, but later "they realized that it was shouting, ‘ I’m circumcised! ’
‘ I am forgiven! ’
This bone is lower above the breast, and Hammel noticed that when he reached this little boy.
"I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' 'and add Hammel'.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital at San Diego, where he is in the worst condition.
What kind of shark is missing is not known.
Seavir, Kapt. Larry Miles said that when speaking on the matter, the shark had been seen there weeks earlier, but it was said that it was not a dangerous type of shark.
Gilles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The officers have closed the sea from Pontio Beach in Casablad to Swami's Lunitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure safety.
Gles said that there are over 35 kinds of sharks in this area, but most of them are said to be harmless.
The Sainsbury's plan to take its products to the UK 's anointing market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debehams with stores of cosmetics and professional people.
As an important way to get into the UK 'UK market which makes up about £2.8bn, which continues to grow while fashion and household items are being reduced, these huge plastics will be tested in 11 stores throughout the world, and there will be more stores in the next year to carry them well.
Paying money on cosmetics is because these stores want to use empty shelves after they are charged with TV, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's will expand the products it contains twice as many as 3,000, including such words as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paw at first.
Those who have remained such as L'Oreal, Mybelline, and Burt's Bees will have plenty of space to put in places with names such as Boots.
The counter will also introduce Boutique correct products so that many will be good for non-eaters - the - demand demand of new customers.
Also, the cracker Fragrance Shop will test demand in the two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened at Croydon, south of London, this past week, and the second will be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the following year.
Buying online and now buying less food a day at nearby stores requires that large stores do more to encourage people to go to them.
Mike Coupe, head of Sainsbury's director, said, these stores will look like big stores with a variety of products, as they try to fight stores with such expensive stores as Aldi and Lidl for more services and other non-food items.
The Sainsbury's purchase places on which Argos could buy Argos in many stores and has started Hasitats because they both bought them two years ago. This increased the purchase of food and profit.
Efforts to improve oil - and - medicine branches have fallen down.
His Sainsbury's tried to contact Boots in the early 2000s, but they broke up after fighting in a way that could separate medical stores from their stores.
This new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's stores for its 281 medical stores at £125m, three years ago.
It says Lloyds will also share in this scheme, by increasing the high-level counterfeiting products that include La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, merchant in Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance of the biscuits with our makeup to improve our customers.
We have planted money for those with whom we have worked, especially for the sake of their advice.
The different products we have are designed to be ready for each demand, allowing a person to seek out the most convenient place to find it, now an attractive place of cosmetics, which differs from the old purchase method.
Peter Jones 'is angry' because Holly Willoughby cut down the £11million business
Peter Jones famous in the Dragons Den went on 'obs anger' after the program driver Holly Willoughby left the £11million industry of life’s product in order to monitor their new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their household products and decorations such as Truly.
The business of the couple was compared to the produce of the Gwyneth Patrow's Goop.
The pilot of the Tis Morning program, with 37, put it in the Instram that you are leaving.
Holly Willoughby left a famous person in the Dragons" Den, Peter Jones grilled with anger because he left the last minute of the life-making industry - so as to take full control of his new attempts with Marks & Spencer and TV.
The sources say that Jones has been “frustrated ” when an important TV girl admitted to a hot meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, if her new contracts — up to £1.5 million - makes her limited time to treat household products and decorations like Truly.
This business is compared to the produce of the Gwyneth Patrow's Goop and has received double money Willoughby's amounted to £11 million.
As Willoughby, who has 37, was putting in the Instagram if he left Truly, Jones went to one of his homes on vacation in Britain.
The source said: "Truly was the most important thing to Holly.
It has been her last resort for a long time over the next ten years.
The decision to abandon him leaves, we leave, and we flee from the shock of everybody.
No one believed what happened on Tuesday, close to the reception feast.
There is a store full of things at Marlow HQ ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the broadcaster of This Morning, one of Britain’s greatest sources of income, may cost the company millions of millions of dollars because of the high cost of growing vast amounts of fuel from the market and candles to the goods and household items, and things that could slow its construction.
And this can mean the end of a long relationship.
The mother of Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cappp for ten years.
] Willoughby established the Truly and Capp in 2016 and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two go together for a holiday, and Jones has 40 percent of the portion in the Baldwin's television company.
Willoughby will be the assistant of this M&S battery and will replace Ant McPartlin as pilot of the I'm A Cellity System.
A source near Jones has said last "We will not talk about his business affairs."
We spoke up ‘ and fell in love'
He is pleased with the criticism of the news by saying what some consider to be “an impiety" and speaking well of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make such sacrifices?
Trump said by his inexperience of the "servative" program.
"I didn't say anything to myself."
She noted that Kim was interested in meeting again after the first meeting in Singapore in June that a Red Cross had been sent by Trump as a major step in the nuclear holocaust in North Korea.
But the nuclear holocaust came to an end.
More than three months after the convention of June in Singapore, North Korea’s senior general Ring Ho told world leaders at the United Nations on Saturday of the Act, that the Northern Hemisphere is “an exact answer ” from the United States to North Korea on missions.
Rather, he said that the United States continues to continue with its focus on oppression.
Trump has given hope to the talk he gave at his party.
"We are doing well with North Korea," said.
“ We fought with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we are very close together.
She noted that her efforts to improve relations with Kim and produce good results from tests of mine, which resulted in the liberation of conquered peoples and the restoration of American soldiers.
And he has protected Kim’s unique communication style.
"It is very easy to be presidents, rather than the 10,000 outsiders who are trying to enter this full stadium we would have about 200 standing here," Trump pointed to the crowd standing right before him.
Indonesia’s Namami and Nyakima, destroying Island, killing hundreds
After an earthquake in Lombok, for example, nongovernmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Even though 10 percent of the population were moved from the area, the area was not declared a disaster zone, which would result in the world’s help.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they are not asking the world for help, so this is a challenge," Mrszn Sumung said.
While the Save of the Children is gathering a group to go to Heaven, it is still uncertain whether foreign workers can work there.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster center, said that Indonesian officials are examining the situation in Heaven to see if the world’s institutions will be allowed to offer relief efforts.
Because of Indonesia’s frequent earthquakes, this country is often not prepared to respond to earthquakes.
While a flood shelter has been built in Aceh, it is rare in some coastal areas.
The absence of a flood alarm in Pala, though warned, may have contributed to people's death.
Even in rare times, traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make travel more difficult.
A hospital ship living in Lombok to help victims of an earthquake goes to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the area where the young people are affected.
President Joko Widori put the emphasis on improving the development of Indonesia’s declining development as he instituted election support, and he has spent a lot of money working on railways and railway railways.
But the lack of financial support has plagued the Mr. The same as it will be reappointed in the next year.
He is faced with the stresses of the sectarian strife in Indonesia, where many Muslim members have entered the central sector of the religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave their homes as Christian groups and Muslims fight on the streets using knives, spears, and other dangerous weapons.

Artist Brian O'Hagan said: ‘ The investigation is just beginning, but I would urge anyone in the John Street area of Birkenhead to see or find anything threatening to contact us.
I would also like to urge anyone, especially taxis, who may have anything to do with the dashcam to contact us as you likely have important information.'
The police spokesman made sure that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead was found in the center of the property.
Relatives who think they know the woman ‘ have come to this remote area and ask questions about the place where we have been located this morning.

Cromwell’s model is the last to be found by the controversy of ‘ rewritement of history.
Their removal will be a repopulated justice because of his destruction similar to that of Tabavan in many of England’s most ancient and religious icons practiced by his ardent Puritan followers.
But Cromwell described Mr Crick's advice as a foolish "and to try to rewrite history."
] John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It would be inevitable that in this conversation there was a removal of images if the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster was a victim.
The destruction of images in English wars was not commanded or done by Cromwell.
Perhaps the Cromwell prisoner will be given because of the actions of his forefather Thomas of the past century.
Sir William Hammo Thornycroft’s description of Cromwell is a testimony to 19th - century views and part of the history of many who still think his life should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more than at the end of the 19th century than now, as an advocate of parliament against external pressure, mainly in his case by the pressure from the empire.
Whether this description is wholly accurate depends on a continuing discussion of the subject of history.
It is certain that the controversy in the mid- 17th century has had a bearing on the development of our next country, and Cromwell is the one who has set himself up for one side of the controversy.
What they accomplish as Sovereign Protector must be celebrated and remembered.
A Deadly Rare Strikes a Chinese Farm and Kills Him
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, described only by his surname "u Yuan," was found dead with a fallen vein, covered with blood near the pig market at Liupanshui's market in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig grower prepares to catch his beehives on May 30, 2005, in Xining Province in Qinghai, China.
It is said that she was accompanied by her cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he discovered that the door to the nearby herd of pigs was open.
He said that there was a large hen of a pig with blood in his mouth.
A survey of the submarine confirmed that the weight of the 50-pounders caused the mother to be killed, according to the report.
"The legs were bloody and twisted," said the cousin named "Wu," as quoted by Guilang Evening News.
The security cameras showed Yuan entering the market in 4,40 am on Thursdays feeding the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The gonorrhea killed Yuan either his own or his cousin.
The manager of the market told the Evening News that the kudu had been locked in order not to attack others, while the police collected evidence from a public area.
Yuan's family and the civil authorities are said to discuss the compensation for his death.
Although rare, it is the situation in which pigs have been shot when they attack people in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a mosquito man and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, a man who was badly injured.
During the past ten years, a 400-inch hen caught the Welsh farmer in the threkhthali until his wife drove out the flock.
After the Oregon farm was eaten by its pigs in 2012, one of Manitoba farmers told the CBC news that pigs did not feel angry but their thirst for blood would cause them to do so.
Soon they’ll just play.
They are nails, extremely cautious... with no intent to harm them.
You need to present yourself to the appropriate rival", say yes.
The perimeter of the Hurricane Rosa brings widespread rainfall to the southwestern U.S.
As weather forecasting events increase, Hercan Rosa falls short as she heads for calmer waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring rain that floods in northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. days.
Rosa has 85 mph winds, the Katheter 1 Hurricane, from 5 a.m in Western Times on Sunday, and was located at 345 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel westward on Sunday.
In the meantime, the trough begins to take shape in the Pacific Ocean and travels east to the west Coast of the U.S.. As Rosa comes to Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm will first absorb the depths of the tropical and northwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches [10 cm] of rain to Mexico’s areas on Monday.
Thereafter, the relative humidity of the tropical flow will cause the heavy rainfall in the Southwest of the days to come.
According to home, 1-4 inches of rain will cause hazardous flooding, the flow of flashments and the earth's magnetic fields in the desert.
By repentance home the deep humidity of the tropical atmosphere will cause rainfall levels to be 2 to 3 inches per hour in the spots, especially in the southern regions of Navajo and Arizona.
Although an estimated 2 to 4 inches of rain is in the regions of the Southwest, especially on the Arizona side.
The noise of the flow of flooded water occurs quickly in the atmosphere of the tropical rain.
It would be no good advice to try to walk in the wilderness in fear of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn cayons into powerful rivers, and thunders will bring in local winds and dust.
Its arrival will bring some heavy rainfall to the area of the Southern California coast.
The entire rain that will occur will be more than half an inch, which may cause small frames to flow through the water and cause slip along the paths.
This rain will be the first rain in this region to be found in the weason basin.
Another brief drop of tropical rain begins to take place in Arizona on Monday evening, before the rains run around Monday and Monday evening.
The heavy rain will rain on the four corners on the second and stop on the third.
In October we can see a certain concern in the U.S. climate as the Arctic can be cooled, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this affects an extreme change of temperature over a short distance.
There is a good example of the extreme types of heat in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
Nearly 20 degrees of contrasts are between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Monies, Iowa.
In the last few days, the heat of summer is trying to build up and expand.
the largest and eastern U.S. is expected to show the rise in temperature in October and the 80 spread from South to North East.
New York City can reach up to 80 degrees a second, which can account for an estimated 10 degrees above normal size.
Our estimate of the weather shape of a long period of time reflects high temperatures in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched the advice of Kavanough Brett.
Over 20 million people have watched Chinese testimony made by High Court Brett Kavanough and a sexual abuser during the 1980 ’ s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political situation is still in progress, with a distribution that interferes with the process of the fifth-rate process to change at the last minute: a contract made by thesen of Arizona by Jeff Flake so that the FBI conducts one week’s trial trial.
Ford told the Senate's Executive Committee that he was sure 100 percent that Kavanaug put his finger under the influence of alcohol and tried to free him of clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in physical evidence, has made 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
It is common to see more than 20.4 million people watching Nelson’s report on January.
The company counted the number of followers in the cases of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not present at this moment so that they could be visible on other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has a number of special checkpoints for people who have watched from offices.
To put it in this case, it is the same size for the followers and when watching the final ends of the football game or the Classrooms.
The Fox Officer of the News, whose opinion holds a system that supports the election of Kavanagh with power, has led all the other network by having a 5.69 million adherents during the day of the repair, says Nielsen.
ABC was in the second place by 3.26 million spectators.
CBS was 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CN was 2.22 million, says Nielsen.
The interest is left up after the advice.
Flake was the title of the eight - hour drama.
After the Central African office has issued a spokesman for the vote to vote for Kavanaough, it is obtained by the CNN and CBS cameras on the Friday morning, which is beaten by guerrillas as they try to climb the chain to the counsel of the Governing Body.
He has stood in anguish for several minutes as he was critical, which he spoke at the moment on CNN TV.
"I am standing here before you", said the man of the nets.
"Do you think you are really speaking in the country?
He was told, "You are strong when most of the humans are weak."
Flake said that his office had issued a commission and that, before closing the tie, he would have much to say to the counseling committee.
The radio network and catable were all broadcast now at the next hour, while the Governing Body would vote to further the election of Kavanaug on the total election net.
But Flake said he would do that only by consulting the FBI where he would view the charges against the choice of the next week, where the Democrats were few groups.
Flake advised this to speak to his friend, Democraticator Chris Coos.
After talking with Cooke and other satellites, Franke has made a decision.
Flake’s choice is a powerful one, for there is evidence that the Riphabgris do not vote to welcome the Kavanauh unless research is done.
President Trump opened the study of the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.

The Rangers were in need of refreshment.
Although they had played so well from time to time under Gerrad, they had fallen far short of these standards.

China has become more active in non-solution, U.S., has to double the amount of time spent in the research section, says the financial support provider and the AI Practicationer Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These commissions come after the various U.S. government agencies make an AI declaration, and such as the U.S., fail on all official methods of the AI.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan this past year: to be No.1 in the AI design in 2030.
"AI's multiplication of the AI budget will be a good start, as all other countries beyond the U.S., and look at the following project of AI," says Lee.
Repetition can increase the chances of the next major success of the AI to the U.S., says Lee in an interview with CNBCs for the week.
Lee, author of the book "The Great Power of AI: China, Siilicon Valley and the New World Order" were published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harturt, the CEO of Sivanation Ventures, which financed one of the largest AI companies in China, the Facebook+.

Facebook, Google, and other technical firms have commissioned university graduates to work at the AI in recent years.
Lee said that a change in foreign patrol would help support the AI effort.
"I think that a blue card will automatically be given to those who make the PhDs in AI," a declaration.
The Council of China issued its Program for the Development of Non-Institution of the Third Generation in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of the Universe provides the financial support for students in educational institutions similar to how the science of nature is conducted as well as other government institutions that contribute financially to U.S. researchers, but to a level of education less than China, says Lee.
Earlier this year in the U.S. Security Committee established the Deputy Center of Influence, which is designed to include cooperative groups from production to education, and the White House announced the establishment of the Deputy Committee.
And in this month the DARPA presented $2 billion save as the beginning of a test called the Next AI.

"We are of the NATATO and the EU, but we want to join actively, not according to the port services" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we are modest.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonians, we can convert such countries as China and Russia into part of the Euro-Asia connection."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO's membership will bring the most needed cash crops to Macedonia, where unemployment is over 20 percent.
"I believe that most people will be attracted to it because more than 80 percent of the people like Nato and EU," says Zaeveves of the vote.

Trump trucks in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the person he has chosen in the High Court Brett Kavanaug while discussing the importance of the departure of the Republiccans to vote for a time of time.
"All that we have done we can lose by November."
There are five weeks before the historic election and the most important event in our time.
This great election is, large, ‛ runlers and don't really run that I am everywhere trying to find suitable people, ’ he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see the terrible things, the evils of the Democrats violent group, you see it right now.
And they are willing to impose their power on them by whatever means they see fit, cruel, unfeeling.
They don't care who have hurt them, who will go over him, that they may get power and authority, and only what they need in the power of power, we will give it to them."
Democrats, you said, are present in special devices on the elements to "deject and interfere."
"You have seen what is happening these four days ago," the declaration, calling the Democrats "because you are angry and callous and indiscretion."
He referred to the Senate’s Committee on the level of the Center of Democraticis Dianne Feinstein in his name, where he had received greetings from onlookers.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you moved to that area?
Oh, Oh, what.
No, no, I expect one – it was so bad to speak about the body so evil that I didn't see it.
The Labour is no longer abandoned.
Speaking out can be difficult for those who think they are
When the Momentum's avitists in my local party voted against me, they were surprised.
After all of this, I am the first in the list of the AMPs of Labours to be told that they are not acceptable to all who speak what they think.
My parliamentary partner Joan Ryan received a similar treatment from me and stood up to the Jews.
In my case, the form of criticism and opposition against me is not compatible with Jeremy Corbyn.
To the important police of the existing economic system, national security, Europe, by presenting similar issues where Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders.
The notice of the conference Nottingham East Labour on January "We want the meetings to be included and to have good results."
For almost all these eight years I was the local Labour'sMP, the GC night meetings on Fridays remained exactly the same.
Where bad things happen today, this modern meeting is not a mere meeting that usually has "human and soft, low" politics has forgotten, however, not to start again.
It seems to be a growing factor that differs from the Labour party and all the opinion is examined before being accepted into the care unit.
This started after Jeremy entered the lead seat, such as a former coworker and a former colleague with a similar view of politics and expected to change it immediately and take places that I would not agree with, whether it is international security or trade or even one of the EU.
Whenever I speak out-and what I don't care about, then the harassment on the communications pages is said to be taken down to the chair, if the institution's politics are accepted, I am told I am not fit to be in the Labour party.
And that is my experience.
Even so, I know that I am more fortunate than my fellow workers as the commissions are brought directly to me and are attracted to politics.
I respect the skill and determination of my workmates who are facing sexual or racial abuse every day but cannot force them away from it.
One of the worst things that can happen to this world’s political elements is the way of life, which is often the case with the most frequent forms of violence.
Jeremy Corbyn explained this past week that the Labour team had adopted the practice of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the main part and in the case of "incredulity" or of changing the principles of the minority gang.
I've had many suggestions over the past two years asking me to stop, not to talk about my speech, and then "every good."
But this is not what I’m going to do in politics.
What I had joined Labour in 32 years as a school child, to be hanged by the government of Thitcher doesn't care about ignoring the room I had left behind, since I swore that I would fight for the best public services and needs, especially if I was rich or government officer.
I could not hide my involvement in politics, including the previous election.
No one in Nottingham’s East can be confused with any way about where I stand in my police, and where I do not agree with the present leadership.
In these increased conditions now in January, I can in every case as long as Brexit was influencing you to do harm to your home, business, and community services, I don't understand his desire to spend my time and energy on my confidence in the leader of the Labour party.
The truth is that the one message I have is not to go to Nottingham Momentum, to my people, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud of working under you and promise that no amount of political aid can prevent me from doing what I believe is your best interests all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr forward
The two later triles are limited to the ends of the platform that almost led to the results, but there is no doubt that Ayr is well suited for this beautiful victory of the Tennent's Premiership Day game.
They now increase the level, which is the most divided side.
Finally, it was their high - quality protection, along with their opportunity to take advantage of a better opportunity, which resulted in the pouring out of the home case with the instructor Peter Murchie.
"We have been tested in our games until now, and have not yet been beaten, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melbourne said: "To commend Ayr, do better than we have done."
Grant Anderson in his try was 14 minutes, replaced by Frazier Climo, and introduced Ayr before, but, a Scottish cap card by Harry Hughes, was released by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make a list of loose bars and Jason Baggot to try to change them.
Climo described Ayr's lead on stage, before, a half-time game time, had put a score after which she changed the zero to 17-5 in Ayr during rest.
But Melrose had a good start for the second half and Patrick Anderson's vehicle, translated by Baggot, reduced the time of five articles.
It has been said that a long time has been spent because of the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who has been removed by a tumor, and when the Ayr next started, he climbs up rapidly by Stafford McDowall, translated by Climo.
Ayr's steady captain Blair Macpherson has been given a card, and once again, Melrose has charged another man with an unalterable vehicle of Bruce Colvine, under intense pressure.
However, it was returned home and when Struan Hutchson was given a toxic card because of hanging Climo without a ball outside the pencil line, Macperson went to sleep after as Ayr did.
Climo has changed, as nearly as it was when it was started again, after Kyle Rowe joined David Armstrong’s balls in a box and sent the flageller Gregor Henry away by installing a fifth - wheel.
Still Game Art appears to be committed to a new work in the Department of the Department.
The Still Game Artist Ford Kiev appears to be more determined in the reception section after it has been found that he has been appointed head of a licensed firm.
A 56-year-old man is playing Jack Jarvis in a famous BBC show, writing it with another expert who looks at humor Greg Hemphill.
The couple had already indicated that the nine - year list would be the last one to conduct the show and that Kernan was apparently preparing to do something else after Craiglang.
According to the list of oral records, he is the emperor of the Adriftmond Limited.
The player has not wanted to comment on this article, although the Scotish Sun source has said that Kernan wants to enter a "profit business" in Glasgow.
‘ Our Sea: Bolivia enclosed on earth with hope that the road will open up the way to the Pacific
The sailors toured the masted capital at La Paz.
Public components blow the blue flag.
The naval decks from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the words: "Our sea is legally ours.
To find it again is our job.
Throughout the world of Bolivia, the coastal memories taken by Chile in the 19th century are still echoing in their desire to return to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may well have prevailed over the centuries, as Bolivia anticipates the trial of a world legal court on October 1 after five years of debate.
"I Bolivia has power, a spirit of unity and quietness, and they wait in good spirits," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian.
Many of the people of Bolivi will hear the judgment of the World Court of Parliament on large corporations throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will stand on the Bolivian question of only a few decades after the debate and then let the Chilean had to think of giving Bolivia a beautiful place to the sea.
Evo Morales, a life - saving president of Bolivia and a relative who is faced with a heavy battle to be picked again the following year also has much to do with the January sentence.
"We are very close to the return to the Pacific Ocean," confirming it towards the end of August.
But some critics argue that the court’s judgment on Bolivia’s side will likely change so much.
The United Nations Committee established in the Netherlands does not have the power to take out the land of Chile, and it states that it cannot know the possible consequences of any talk.
The fact that the Court of the World Rules appears only six months after the debate indicates that this case is "free of doubt," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean legal specialist.
And instead of cooperating with Bolivia’s wishes, four years might well take it back.
"The matter of sea access has been stolen by the existing government of Bolivia," says Zárate.
The argument against Morals concluded any kind of kindness in Chile, saying.
Bolivia and Chile will speak about another day, but it will be very difficult to hold conversations after the event.
These two countries have not been in close proximity to the Allied forces since 1962.
Former President Eduard Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative of The Hague, has rejected the court’s decision on a spur - of - the - moment basis.
Monday will give Bolivia "a special opportunity to reveal a new page to deal with Chile" and the opportunity to“ eliminate 139 years of friction for profit," said.
Calzadilla has also rejected the fact that Morals - being is one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — using this matter of the sea as a political party.
"I Bolivia will never simply abandon its privilege of access to the Pacific Ocean," and run away.
"This sentence is an opportunity to see if we have to overcome past events.
North Korea says that it will not be rid of nuclear weapons until it can trust the United States
Central Korean Minister Ring Ho says that his country will not be rid of its nuclear weapons before he trusts Washington.
LI was referring to Saturday to the United Nations Parliament.
He asked the United States to follow up promises made during a conference held in Singapore among experienced leaders.
These words are uttered just as the National Assembly Mike Pompio seems to start a new nuclear exchange over three months after those of Singapore and Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
RI says that the continuing and refusal of the United States to end the Korean War will ever make the North surrender.
Washington is alert to agree to the agreement before Pyongang took steps to break these weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump wanted a second meeting.
But many doubt that Pyongang is willing to sacrifice the weapons that the country views as the only way to ensure safety.
Pompeii plans to visit Pyongang the coming month to prepare for the conference of Kim and Trump.
Paris ’ fashion shows depict the latest different hats you will see on the streets of a nearby town
If you want to increase the hats you have or want to cover the sun, then get away somewhere.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have begun creating a wide variety of very unusual S19 show hats that have fallen off the deck placed in Paris’s Mutswave.
These impressive hats have flooded the Instramagram in this form and these designers have sent their frightening hats to the mirror.
Valentino's single-hitch belt has a wide strip and cover the entire head of the wardrobe overseer.
Some extremely large hats included crowns with earrings, a hat, and even pineapple, but they were not designed to warm your head.
Thomas Browne, on the other hand, came with a series of horrendous masks right at the time of the Mediterranean era.
Many of these colorful masks have succulent lips and are much like Hannibal Lacter than do the fashion they do not.
One hat would look like to enter the water with a ventilator, while the other was like a knob of melted ice cream.
And if you like the taste of faddish fashion, you are fortunate.
People in the entertainment world say that these facial expressions may also be coming to your area.
These outstanding hats are on the steps of La Bombay', a two-footed sun hat worn by people like Richardna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The special hat that made these unusual hats filled the pages of communications came with another big display of the grass bag carried on the coast almost as large as the laundryman you are carrying.
La Rivier SS19 in Paris's Fertile Vicquemus.
The famous designer poet Luke Armitage told FEMALL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags reaching people in the following summer - as the builders have gone into the wild, it will be hard to ignore people who would have been looking for these great things here.'
John Edward: Language skills are important to people of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have a reputation for academic achievement, and this has continued in 2018 with other long - term results, boosted by individuals and the success of a team in sports, art, music, and other public pursuits.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCISs), are trying to offer a high level of service to their students and parents.
Single schools try to prepare their students for higher education, higher education, and a better place in the world.
As a school curriculum that can create and fit a school cabinet, we see available languages going on as a popular subject and the need for choice at school.
Nelson Mandela once said: "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, he reaches his mind.
If he speaks to him in his own language, he reaches his grief.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English to build up association and trust with foreigners.
From the recent results of performances, we can see that languages are high on the table at a high level to pass through private schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students have received articles from Highergrade A.
A report compiled, from 74 SCIS schools, indicates that 72 percent of the students have found Highergrade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students are learning German, 96 percent of the French students and 63 percent of the Spanish students.
This indicates that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills for children and young people who certainly want them in the future.
Now languages, such as the study being selected, are similarly valued as STEM (science, technology, which I have anering and mathtics) in private school and others.
Research done by the UK Commission for Developing and Skills in 2014 found that for reasons given by employers for the problem of rooming, 17 percent are associated with a lack of language skills.
More than that, language skills will be needed to prepare young people for the work that they will do in the future.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are useful in a cooperative world.
No matter what job you choose, if you learn another language, you will have more opportunities in the future to develop such skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other lands has opened up opportunities to come in contact with a person who knows many languages.
According to the temptation of the Youth Gov of the 44,000 adults of the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak another language well enough to communicate and only French is spoken by more than 15 percent, 15 percent.
That is why the investment of money in the development of the language is now important to the children of today.
Knowing many languages, especially those in developing lands, will equip children with fine opportunities for satisfying work.
In Scotland each school will become a unique language.
Several schools will concentrate on current languages, while others will teach languages that are considered important in the UK in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in private schools, and there are plenty of teachers in this section.
Scotland’s independent schools are eager to prepare a teaching program that will equip children with the skills needed for success, no matter where they go in the future.
It cannot be denied now, in the world’s commercial climate, that languages continue to be important to the future of this world, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as "the ability to communicate with the world."
Private schools will continue to provide the choice, separation and absence of young people in Scotland.

The Lakers instructor and Luke Walton announced that James would play on the scenes of the Sunday tragedy against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it will appear that you’re going to play for several minutes.
"You will be more than one and less than 48," said Walter on the Lakers official website.
The story of Lakes Mike Trudell says that it is possible for James to play only a few minutes.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his plans for an automaton of Lakers ’ agony.
"I don't want pre-invention games at this point of my work to be good," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, You Tube Channel
President Donald Trump starts his long - standing riots this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This was the first of the five events scheduled for the following week, including visiting friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the certificate’s certificate is signed until he chooses to be appointed to the High Court, Trump tries to reverse the support of the second election because the Republicans are in danger of losing the Congress ruling in Nov.
When will the Trump convention in West Virginia last evening and see it online?
The Trump Assembly of Wheeling, West Virginia, is held 7 p.m., Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see a Trump convention in West Virginia on the Internet by listening to a tributary in You Tube.
Trump is expected to speak at this week’s meeting of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanough, who is in a difficult situation because of charges of sexual misconduct on the grounds of a week - long check.
But the foremost goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans cope with the November election.
As a result, the President Trump project said that these five meetings in the coming week are focused on the "strength of volunteers and sponsors as the Republicans try to protect and increase their numbers in the House of Prostitution and in the Federal Council," Reuters said.
"Congregation of Congress is so important to him that the president will go to as many countries as we approach the busy rotary building," a Tump pinman who never wanted to be known as the Reuters.
Organized at Webanco Arena in Wheeling, this modern clock at night can provide support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and is also known by Pittsburgh for its news," says West Virginia's News.
Saturday will be the second time that Trump visited West Virginia, the government division that won by 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to help West Virginia’s Republican Minister Patrick Morrisey, who goes after the election.
"It’s not a good sign for Morsey's president to come to his support," says Simon Head, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The Ryder Cup 2018: The American team shows that if you are looking for success, you will continue to fight as one who looks forward to going to individual games on Sunday.
After three games alone, playing as the first of four people is what the Ryder Cup needs most.
The title of the top of any team has given the idea of the sports characters who sincerely believe in it, and it is in competition like this.
Who is the greatest in the present time?
"Let them pay for six points and are now four, so I think we are going ahead," says Jordan Spieth while he is walking the same day.
Europe has taken this time, in fact, four points above and the other 12 are not yet verified.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel good and there are many interested in it, including the way Spieth and Justin played well all day and the couple have three to four articles.
Spieth has always played well since the beginning and pays for example.
When people shout loudly for joy while kicking him, he puts on a ball during a special occasion after he and Thomas are struck with two articles.
Beating a ball in a ball to win a game by reaching 15 has caused people to respond in the same way, in ways telling you that the American team is inexperienced.
"You have to worry about your game at all," says Spieth.
And leave them there.
18 holes to identify from.
Players on top of the Spieth and Thomass in the last two days are Francesco Molinary and Tommy Fleet, a controversial story of the Ryder Cup
Europe’s roads produce unusual married couples and cannot do anything wrong.
"The two called Moliwood" is the one that doesn't sign the bogy on Saturday season and Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, and the Backine on Friday morning.
Such cooperation, along with their interest, seems beautiful to the crowds with them as church athletes, and no other noble player can conquer Europe when the sun passes through Le Golf National instead of Fleeed and Mulinori.
It is best to play together at the same time in a different location.
Commenting on European success is not yet seen, however.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson did the work of Sergio Garcia, a four-baller in the morning, when she got cooperation with Alex Noren.
Bogey and other two-part-to-left articles and a Spanish hole and a Mishman could not get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of that hole.
Four footballs and four players are happy to watch them nearby because of the combined cooperation, advice, advice, and how the program can change in a matter of time.
Europe has played much better as a team up until now and is leading to the last day but four players have observed that the American team has ordered unbelievable relief if possible, particularly the Stateside.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take the lead well in the last day of the Ryder Cup after four articles and four games that have made them pay for 10-6 Americans.
Impressed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary, the couple changed the game to defeat the suffering Tiger Woods to make progress in the Le Golf National by four articles.
The European Thomas Bjorn case, wanting to defeat the rod that separated them from Hazeltine two years ago, defeats the American morning case in four articles, winning a series of 3-1.
America had no easy response to four sports, going through double winnings, although they had not been able to stop the debt.
Jim Furyk's case requires eight articles in 12 private games to obtain this prize
Fleetwood was the first European to list four points that were new in the same time with Molinori, called "Molliewood" after the second second weekend to win four points when the Ryder Cup was opened.
When Woods and Patrick Reed were hit in four holes, they went on to conquer Woodsn and the American parish Brysin Dechambau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who has drawn himself to two Saturday games, showed there and interest but divided 19 into 29 games into four bars and four players in a row.
Justin Rose retired from the fourballs and returned with her assistant Henri Stenson in 21 and 1 in defies Dustin Johnson and the world’s leading Brooks Koepka
Europe had not been easy to conquer in France.
Jordan Spieth's victory three times, and Justin Thomas made the best of the Americas, receiving two articles on Saturday.
They gained a victory by 2 and 1 when they played with Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of the fourbaals and later divided Poulter and Harry McIlroy by 4 and 3 of these two opening holes.
Twice on the Ryder Cup the team returns from the separat to the individual games, although Foryk’s side requires playing on each other to get the net.
After two days on the second day, Sunday’s attack was a protection.
North Korea says that ‘ he will never complete his weapons before he finds protection.
The director of a foreign department in North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that these judgments made it impossible between America and that there was no way for America to complete its Nuclear weapons if they could obtain security guarantees.
Rg Yong Ho told the audience to take positive action the previous year, such as halting the tests of the armament and breaking down the Nuclear armaments, and making a promise never again to make Nuclear equipment.
However, we don't see the corresponding steps from America," says.
"If there is no promise from America, there will be no hope for the security of our country, and in this case we will not destroy our equipment without talking to America."
While RI says again what is commonly said by North Korea about America’s refusal to complete Nuclear's weapons in classes under which North Korea has been paid for the small steps they have taken, his report did not deny what Pyongson had been done to complete poorly.
Ri spoke of a joint report by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first conference between the president of North Korea and the president of Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to serve “complete the Nuclear armament instead of Korea" while Trump promised the protection of Korea.
North Korea wanted to end the Korean War of 1950-53 justly, but America said that Pynyang should first eliminate Nuclear's weapons.
The Wachington has declined requests to reduce severe international sentences toward North Korea.
"America forces "the completion of Nuclear weapons" first" and increases the level of pressure by means of sentences to accomplish their purpose in a compelling way, against proclamations of the end of the war," R.
"The idea that sentences can frighten us is a false dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that these judgments increase trust.
L was not referred to the plans of a Kim conference with Trump, which the American leader spoke before the United Nations this week.
Instead the minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and the president of southern Korea and Mon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the group in this case of passing Nuclear equipment is southern Korea and not America, it was not until you have completed Nuclear's equipment in place of Korea."
However, the expression I heard is different from the previous year, when speaking to the UN General Assembly of the U.N. that the target of North Korea flying equipment in an American country could not be avoided after "M. Bad President" Trump called Kim "a man of flying weapons" for suicide.
In this year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened "to completely destroy" North Korea, boldly gave Kim the praise for taking steps to eliminate weapons, but claims that there is much more work to do and that the judgments will remain long after North Korea completed Nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time set, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongang for the steps she has taken.
Nevertheless, American secretary Mike Pompio told the U.N Security Council on Thursday: "The continuation of the judgments of the Security Council should not proceed strongly until we can see the total closing of Nuclear armaments."
The Security Council has presented judgments in North Korea since 2006 for the end of Nuclear flying equipment.
Pompio joined R beyond the U.N General Assembly and said that he would visit Pynyang again for a second conference.
Pompio has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit failed.
He left Pyyyang in July, saying that there was a progress made, but North Korea claimed that he made a "like requirement for robbers."
North Korea promised to meet Monon this month so that they could break up the Nuclear flying equipment if America was "compliant steps."
Kim told her that the "compliance measures" required the security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore and the progress in regular association with Washington.
Harvard students take adequate rest courses
A new study at Harvard University this year provides enough sleep for all the students who are not yet tracked to sleep enough to fight the habit of studying all night by taking caffeine.'
One expert has found that the high university students do not know what to look for.
Charles Czeisler, director of sleep therapy at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's hospital, held this study, believing that the first of this type in America is the first.
He was encouraged by his talk about the results of lack of sufficient sleep in the study.
‘ Why am I told that now, I’m going to finish school? ’ one girl came to me.
He told me that no one had told him the importance of sleep that surprised me, saying that he told The Telegraph.
This study has started this year, explaining the benefits of sleep as to the development of education and sports, as well as improving their general health.
Paul Barrerira, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and high - school medical services at the university, says that the university decided to bring this lesson to the attention of students who did not really sleep.
This one hour’s study includes a series of pleasant activities.
In one section there is a picture of a university boarding room, where students click coffee cups, curtains, training clothes and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects the development of sports.
In the same section, participants are told how sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
The school map, with its exciting features, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that he will never change the behavior of the disciples's' immediately.
Even so, we believe that they have the right to know about you as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking bars," says teacher Czeisler, adding.
The practice of sleeping self - denial still exists, which he says, adds that modern technology and pressures on the students are a growing problem
Making sure that you sleep enough should be an unknown weapon against stress, fatigue, stress, and anxiety, as well as avoiding obesity, since lack of sleep impairs the mind, making it more and more hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old who lives in California, learned about chemistry and biology, enabled Professor Czeisler to study the class, after attending his first class in his first year in Harvard.
He said that the class had opened his eyes and showed him the interest in making the whole class available.
You hope that the next step will be to ask the students to do the same reading session before entering the competition.
Czeisler suggests that students think they have made sleeptime alarm, as well as wake, and that they are cautious about the dangerous effects of electric lights and LED light, which can interfere with the daily schedule of sleep problems.
The Livingston 1-0 Rangers Menga's men of Gerrard in one article
The Rangers also encountered a problem when playing while Dolly Menga was playing the Steven Gerrad with a single point at about 0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox's case was about to be enthused after St Johnstone had hit 41 in February. But the group of Gary Holt hit Gerard for the second time in 18 in the game, so they started to become a manager as he lost eight points except the top band at Ladbrokes Premisship, Herts.
Menga found an article in short minutes ahead of the haf-time and the Rangers were not interested.
By the time the Rangers fell into the sixth place, the Livingston climbed up the third after it by the Hibernian to leave them with one article.
Then there were problems with the Rangers after the Marinesman Camum Spence was treated to the head with a head wound after he was hit by a missing object from the side of the playees.
Gerard changed the games with Ayr in the game before the last Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt continues with 11 Livingstone's similar players who took one point in Herts the week ago and rejoice in the way his team hit its opponents in all manner.
The Rangers had control of the game, but Livingstone did more when he got the ball.
It should have played the score in the second second second time when Menga player allowed Scott Pittman to pass through the lungs of Allan McGregor but this player did not find it.
Keaghan Jacobs rejected Craig Halkett, but his partner, Alan Lithgow, was able to open the background.
The Rangers did not get control but seemed more optimistic than the belief about the third game before the last.
Alredo Morelos felt he should get a pencil on the half hour of the hour as he and Steve Lawlesss clashed, but the accordant Steve Thompson did not heed the voice of the Colombian performer.
The Rangers had the opportunity to kick the ball near the pans before finishing the first stage of the game, but the soccer player Liam Kelly found no problem with Lasana Coulibaly's head and Missie Ejaria.
When Livingstone received the first article in 34 minutes that had been difficult to find, no one can deny that it is truly worthy of them without any effort at all.
The Rangers also failed to prevent a soccer ball rejected by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not act like the Declan Gallagher who passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who did not worry about fulfilling Menga.
Gerrard’s initial transformation with the conversion of Colibaly put the change in Ryan Kent and brought about the results as soon as the player opened the door to Morelos, but the player ran away and stopped.
But the Livingston has continued to make the team to play the game, and Lithgow and Halkett were kicking the ball back.
Holt's team could get an article at the beginning of the game, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow was memorized.
One of the Rangers late model Glenn Middleton had another judgment case for him as he had met with Jacobs but had not been interested in Thomson.
Almanac: Geiger Counter Developer
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and SSASAKA ... the date scientists Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for searching and measuring radiation, which was produced by the development of a device known as the Geiger.
It has been used since then, the Geiger County has also been used for pop culture as well, as shown in a film in 1950 known as "Balls of Colondao," whose unlikely players became scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?
Rogers: "It is Geier County, used to search for precious stones.
When you put these things in your ears, you will hear the effects of Atoms which are released by radiation.
Evans: "No, it really appears now!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, after a few days of his 36th birthday.
But this teaching that bears his name will live on.
A new cancer infection teaches the muscles to ‘ see ’ difficult cells
A new cancer campaign teaches the muscles to ‘ see ’ the heavy cells and kill them
The crocodile teaches the muscles to identify sensitive cells as part of the treatment
How to do so includes removing the body’s cells from the patient, and changing them to the lab.
So they can ‘ see ’ normal proteins in cancer and are restored to the body
Tests produce promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One retired patient who received a treatment with an injection, which teaches the muscles to see strange cells in the body, saw the uterine cancer disappears after about 18 months.
The way to do so involves removing the body’s tissue cells from the patient, converting them to laboratoryary de "see" normal proteins in the cancer called HER2, and restoring them to the body again.
University teacher Jay Bezofsky, of the American National Cancer Center in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a virtual vaccine.
HER2 HERS2 give interest in the growth of different cancers. Among breast cancers, uterine, steam and stomach cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
The same method of dispersimilating the body’s muscles in patients and can teach them to search for cancer cells has been effective in the field of leukemia.
The West Strump’s Support in Talk, With an Embalmiced Lady, After appearing in the NSL.
It Did Not Go Good
The Kane West received no further support during the Saturday Right Live after the disaster that brought praise to the American President Donald Trump and said you would enter the election in 2020.
After singing the third song that night, a song called The Short Town carrying a proprietary Ake America’s Great America, he then gave a speech against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"Many times when I talk to the white man, saying, "How can you love Trump? You are a racial person."
And if I were concerned about race, I would have gone away long ago,' he says.
The SNL started its program with a video showing Matt Dam that laughs with the evidence of Brett Kavanough before the Committee of the Court of Justice with cases of sexual harassment from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not yet been published, the West video is placed in chat rooms by reviewer Chris Rock.
Needless to say, Rock was playing with the video on the West.
Also, the West is angry with the observers by having to meet the difficulty before entering about his hat.
"They have used me back behind.
They said to you, ‘ Don't take your hat over.'
They did!
And they said I was in a quiet place, ” says Washington Examiner.
West added: "Do you want to see a collapsed place?" saying you will wear a ‘ superman' garment, because it means what I can do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to show love.

He is free.
We, too, say, add.
Before the program, the rapper informed his followers to Twitter that he had justly changed his name, known as "Nine West by justice."

What is taught by television, street, and street children to think boys are more likely to become men?
How do I think the question of urgency affects our decisions?
For there is clearly something wrong with our boys.'

HIV/ Aids: Chinese reported an increase of 14% of new patients
The Chinese reported a rise in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in 14%.
There are over 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
An estimated 440,000 sufferers were diagnosed in the first quarter of 2018 alone.
In many cases people are affected sexually, which is different from what is common in the past.
Naturally, most Chinese people are affected by blood transfusions.
But the number of people affected in this way was drastically reduced, and medical authorities in China said so at the Yunnan conference.
Every year, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China rose by 100,000.
HIV infection is a real problem for the people of GBT in China.
Homosexuality is no longer common in China since 1997, but discrimination against the people of GLBT is considered difficult.
Because the country has such negative views, research has made it clear that 70-90% of men will marry adults.
Incontinence is often created with insufficient protection through sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access to drugs in HIV as part of the problem.
Maxine Waters cites information about the GOP satellites introduced by the employee in the tradition, and ‘ a serious lie ’ could ‘ say the things that are not true'
American representative Maxine Waters on Saturday spoke out against charges that one of his employees put personal information on the Republictics in Wipedia.
The Los Angeles Democratic Republic has stated that these charges are advertised by experts and their respective Web sites.
"False, false and multiple lies," says Waters in a report in Twitter.
According to reports the details issued by home addresses and telephone numbers of these were of America. Linsey Graham of southern Carolina, and Mike Lee, including Orrin Hattch, Utah.
These are from the Internet on Thursday, placed by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill at a time rather than by a council’s speech on the neutrality and charges of misfits of the High Court’s election Brett Kavanough.
The insects are released some time later by the authorities to bombard Kavanaug with questions.
Wise Internet sites such as the Gateway Put and the RedSTate have reported that the IP addressrs indicate that the source of the solvents comes from Waters' office and even removed the staff's staff, says The Hill.
"These groundless charges are entirely false," adds Waters.
"A member of my employees - risked that his personal details are published because of these false charges that are not available - he was responsible for the removal of these falls.
This groundless charge is completely false.
Waters' report received immediate criticism on the Internet, including the former secretary of the American President Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is in the rage," wrote Fleischer
"He does not have the degree to become a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he does not have to be upset.
He does not have to fight.
He does not have to ask the prosecutor’s intentions.
It is forced to calm down and heal.
Fleischer may have compared Walters ’ response with the criticisms of the Democrats by Judge Kavanough, accused of being too angry on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, members of the Republican monastery, did not pass the decision to release Waters during the year, also expressed his opinion to Twitter.
"Amerge if this is true" wrote to Twitter.
In his noise, Waters introduced his office to the "compliant authorities and law departments with false charges.
We will ensure that the suspects are revealed, ” says he added, "and they will legally pay for their dangerous actions to my employees."
Reconstruction of Johnny English Strikes Against - advised twin of Rowan Atkinsons
It is not unusual for days to look at items about Brexit when watching a flight related to the English, similar to the recent renewed flight of the jigsaw puzzle and rioting Johnny English - drawn in 2003 and returning in 2011 is called the Johnny English Reborn.
Will this exciting exhibition discuss news news that we no longer have access to foreign trade?
This photographer named Johnny finds his license to renew his proving that he is an outcast made by non - English observers.
He is actually the role of the State's trucker and chief who engages in a somewhat different way than that of Clouseau, Mr. Bean and at least one of the boy singing a single song song in the Chaiots of Fire at the opening of London's Olympic in 2012.
He even became a traveler with a well - known international secretman Atkinson, who copied through the Barclraycard ads, leaving the disputes he left there.
There are at one or two times in this show, and watch YE.
I liked this time Johnny English came to helicopters dressed in front of the helicopters while a helicopter hit his hat.
Atkinson's frivolous gift is interesting, but it is not so strong when compared with such heavy products as 007 and the Mission Impossinle that include humor at present.
These jokes seem to be considered by children rather than by adults, when I tell my side that Johnny’s ridicule does not reflect a little ability compared with the untkinson silent shooting of Bean while playing
The news on this show checks if the English are in serious trouble.
The Internet junkie entered illegally on the Internet network, saw details of all the English cables working, until the tunnel on Kevin Eldon's job - only role was surprised.
The news is about a proud high official who faces the problem of being politically unpopular: Emma Thompson tries to do what is right while playing Teresa May but the writer of the exhibition did not do well in writing it.
Wise counselors told him that just as all solvents are in danger, they should be forced to return a retired person.
And that’s what little girl Johnny English himself, who has earned the position of the principal teacher in school and in class, has paid off, but gives formal lessons as unknown to no one, while England teaches strangely how he becomes a catalyst than the times of truth.
English is brought back to Whitewall and told about this emergency to meet his best friend, Bough, who was once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is a married man, married to the Lord of the submarine.
This couple, who are capable of doing wrong things in the nursing service, return to work, and meet the Ophelia Bulleba, whom Olga Kurylenko ate
Meanwhile, the high priest believes a multimillionaire who can solve the problems of English computers: the evil man Jason Volts, played by Duke Lacy
English and Bough started the rescue: making themselves food producers, burning the French food chain; started problems when they board the wealthy Volta's ship; and England brings an attack when they try to use the casts on the Vitual Real Real Real for the reading of the interior of the Volta house.
Everything has been done in the final section, though interesting and interesting, instead of children’s television programs talking about the whole thing.
Common object.
Like all other displays of Johnny’s English ball: Do I wonder if the English - speaking industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a proper place in his skills?
The work force denys that it makes provision for the British community to work four days but to be paid five
Jeremy Corbyn’s work crew made a plan to get the employees to work four days a week but to pay five days ’ wages.
Reports say that this group requires company managers to pay employees to pay off wages when companies work for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) to give them a date.
The change will turn employees on a three - day weekend, but the same reward will be paid.
The sources say that the program is ‘ well suited ’ with the economic ideas of the group and the policy of the country’s replacements and the provision for employees.
The four-day conversion of the week cancels the support of the Trade Union Congress as a means for employees to take over the economic change.
The top source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: ‘ System tests are expected to be announced before the year has passed.
‘ It may not happen immediately, but a four - day working week is the ideal idea of this new economic unit to be alongside the employees and the business plan of this group.'
The work crew was not the first to give support to such an idea, and Green Party made a provision for four days while they were laying the support of the election in 2017.
This program presently does not get full support from the Labour Party, however.
A spokesman for the Service Department said: ‘The week of four days of work is not a group policy and it is not an object to consider.'
The assistant director John McDonnell has used the past week’s service conference to clarify his view of economic reforms.
Sir McDonnell says that he is willing to take on the strength of ‘ rulers who do not want to be seen by anyone' and ‘ get profited ’ in big business.
This assistant manager's program means that water-marketers cannot get their assignment as a job government can pay the ‘packages ’ that say they are not doing well.
He reaffirmed his plan to put the employees in managerial positions and to make a pocket money involving everyone in order to give the employees a 10 - percent portion of nongovernmental businesses that could afford them as much as £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told the "60 Minutes" if the FBI could change their opinion.
Brett Kavanaugh's investigation of the accusations made by the judge delays the last match for his arrest in the High Court each week, and raises the question whether the results of the study of the state can change the full extent of the Republiccans to change their minds with the support they give.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, a reporter for the 60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the then rich Czechs John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that could cause them to cover their minds.
Kennedy seemed to have more trouble speaking than her sister from South Carolina.
"Now" says Kennedy
"I say I am going to get into the mess, and I have spoken to the judge Kavanaug.
I would call him after the thing came out, after the charges were issued, saying, ‘ Have you done it? ’
He was calm, confident, not afraid.
Even so, it seems that Graham’s face will not change.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaug and will be forced by a heavy bearing, ” says.
Gqhih. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied the latters," adds Graham, talking to Chrstine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who speaks about him can confirm these charges.
36 years
I don't see any changes.

Now he has been a symbol for years, and he receives tens of thousands of people in the Centrera; Park not only to entertain them with such spectacular displays as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but to introduce them to the purpose of the event which was the actual solution to a severe crisis in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a section in addition to the Global Poverty Project, a international center that hopes to eliminate poverty by adding to people who are responsible to fight it.
To obtain a free ticket to attend an event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you must do volunteer work such as writing an e - mail, telephone, or any other meaningful means to inform others of their purpose to eliminate poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been as 12 years old fulfilled its purpose?
Is it good to give people a good deal of fun is the right way to get support — people feel that they are making a difference by signing a social network or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen reported that it has counted 19 million actions for its sponsors, facing various purposes.
These actions have helped by encouraging the world’s taxpayers to record commitments and multimillionaires, which will be responsible for the lives of 2.25 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the team described the terms of obligations and 390 reports for their actions, costing billions of dollars.
This group says that their income has helped nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of these safeguards include The Power of Nutrition, which is a financial institution and the people who made it possible for the U.K.'s purpose is to "help children grow up to this point," which promises to give Rwanda 35 million to complete malnutrition in the country after receiving 4,700 messages from the Global Citizens.

This group, after some 5,000 actions requested by the U.K to improve proper nutrition for mothers and children, has been informed by the government about the cost of handling the problem, by The Power of Nutrition, which will help mothers and children to provide food.
When they answer one of the most common questions asked on the Internet, "What makes you think we can solve serious problems?"
The Global Citizen said: "It draws a long and difficult course - sometimes we will fall and divide.
But like the transforming of human rights and the striving for anticormininism before us, we will succeed, for we are strong when we are with one another.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendeles, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, others to enjoy the occasion this year in New York, whom Deborra- Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman were welcomed.
America can use water sawps to interfere with Russia’s production of electrical power - the - Interactive Secretary - General
America can find safety under the navy in order to prevent Russia from selling electrical appliances, including the Middle East, explains the American Secretary of State, Ryan All as the Washington Examiner.
Zinzi made charges of Russia’s responsibility in Syria - where government officials officially made arrangements to investigate new electrical systems.
"I believe that their purpose in the Middle East is to sell other countries as Europe has done in Eastern Europe, South European stomachs," says.
And, according to the authorities, there are ways and abilities to deal with them.
"America has the power, by the navy, to make sure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that their power is not moving to the market," says.
Zinzi was talking to those present at an event approved by the Consummer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls himself "in the voice of electric operators" in America.
He then compared the way America faced Russia with Iran, which states that they have not changed.
"The economic preference in Iran and Russia, almost, to raise costs and additional replacements for oil," says, while calling Russia for a single living life that depends on natural power.
The report comes after the Trump government has put forth efforts to promote foreign gas from Europe, entering Russia’s power, with no high price for Europeans.
As a result, officials of the Trump government, including the American President Donald Trump, tried to stop Germany from supporting the work of the Nord Stream 2, according to Trump, made Germany the "prison" of Russia.
Russia has also stated that the Nord Stream 2 pipe, costing $11 billion, will double the present 110 billion cubic metres, is an excellent economic job.
Russia says that American opposition to this work has economic reasons and is an example of poor competition.
"I believe that the power should not be the power to pressure, and the buyers are forced to select the merchants," says Russian Power Minister Aleksandr Novak after the meeting with American Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
America’s position in this situation is not well - received in Germany that has confirmed the determination of the project.
The main center of the industry, the State of German Business (BDI), has requested that America travel away from the EU's forces and alliances like Germany and Russia.
"I have a big problem when the third nation is interfering with our strengths." says Dieter Kempf, head of the German State Trade Center (BDI) after a meeting with the German administrator Angela Merket and Russian president Vladimir Put.

An American representative accuses China of ‘ exploiting ’ by using ‘ false advertising ’
A week later an official Chinese newspaper made an advertisement in an American newspaper on the profits of American and Chinese commerce, an American ambassador in China accusing the country by using American news coverage.
American president Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke on a Chinese advertisement in the best - selling newspaper Des Moines Register - Iowa -ima to accuse China of its intentions to thwart the election of November 6, which condemned China.
Trump’s charge that China is trying to interfere with the election is what the American authorities tell Reuters that a new section of the ongoing search for America to put pressure on China.
It may be common for governments in different countries to advertise to promote trade, China, and America to compete in trade for the present time and to generate additional prices.
China adds prices in exchange for the economic crisis and is designed to affect foreign suppliers in government slogans such as Iowa supporting the Trump group of the Republican, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Bransstad, an American representative in China and the former governor of Iowa, who sells to China most of the food crops, said, China has damaged American employees, farmers and businesses.
China, Brandad wrote expressing his opinion in Des Moines Register, "he is now determined to exploit us by putting false advertising into our newspapers."
"When spreading false news, the Chinese government is at risk to hear America using its usual custom of free speech and free publicity in the Des Moines Register," writes Brasstad.
"In contrast, instead of the news station here in Beijing when you walk down the platform, you will get a little different opinions and you will never see how the Chinese really think of the economic development in China, thinking they are under the Chinese communist group, writing.
He added that "one of the conventional newspapers has denied his request to publish this matter, however it does not say which newspaper is.
The Republican forces drive in front of the people prior to a cross election about Kavanaug’s problem, warning analysts
Like the High Court’s high - ranking Republicans standing next to the prisoner of the High Court Brett Kavanough and protecting him from his charges, sexual abuse, analysts say they will see the bad shots, especially on the people in the middle, in this coming election of the first half.
Feelings about this situation have been many times over, and the republics have also said that they want to continue the election.
You can't put them back," says Grant Reeher, a university professor of political studies at Syracuse University's Maxwell School telling The Hill when an article was written on Saturday.
Reeher says he doubt that the last time attempts of the time will still include Jeff Flake (R-Arizina) to initiate the study of the FBI if they can change the minds of angry voters.
"People will not immediately forget what happened yesterday or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, the top counselor and national speaker of the group that continues on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters again said ‘ Come on November! ’ walking in the satellite hallway as the Republican governed the Justice Committee and decided to continue the detention of Kavanough despite the testimony of the physician Christine Blasey Ford, states Mic.
"Your interest in freedom and encouragement will be many," says St. Rothonberg, a neutral prosecutor, telling the news service.
"People have begun to say that you are higher than now, this is true.
But there may be more than this, especially for those who have not yet made a decision about who will vote with young, 1829-year-old electors, who, although not a president, are not normal to vote.
Even before Ford public testimony explaining his accusations about the prisoner of the High Court of Sexual Abuse, critics say that there may be negative results when the republics need proof.
"This has become a problem about the IPP," says Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee last week when it started, according to NBC News.
"It isn't important for the committee's office or last-point vote or if Kavanaug is entering a plot, as to how the Republicans view the situation and how to handle it," states Guy Cecil in this news agency, the president of the Pritoties USA, a group assisting to choose the Democrats.
Even so, the borders seem to do not seem to understand what they believe between the Ford and the Kavanaugs, although there are still a few who take the side of the latter.
The 41 percent who participated in one survey showed that they were likely to believe in or fully believe Ford evidence, while 35 percent showed that they could believe it fully or fully believe Mr.
In addition, 38 percent of those who thought Kavanaugh might be suspected of being false while giving a witness are at the same time just 30 percent who say the same for Ford.
After Flake’s interest, the FBI does research on the charges brought by Ford and another devil, Deborah Ramires, says The Guardian.
Ford presented the preconditioned evidence before the panel of justices last week, saying that Kavanaug had abused her 18th sexual abuse when she was drunk by Kavanuagh
Ramirez charges that this prisoner of the High Court revealed his private parts to him while they were attending a ceremony in Yale during the 1980 ’ s.
The Internet producer made arrangements to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Time Berners-Lee, the Internet producer, begins a new business with the aim of competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
This technological laboratory has a new Inrupt, which is the principle of the Solid production process available to anyone.
The Solid allows its users to choose where their details are kept and who have access to those details.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners- Lee spoke with the goal of Inrupt which is "control of the whole world."
"We must do it now," referring to this business.
"An hour will not forget this."
This system through the technical machinery will allow people to make themselves a "forensitary" or POD.
It may include a list of telephone numbers, a list of activities, calendar, music, and other personal and business matters.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Black, and Spottify were in the same place at the same time.
Unlike this storage area, it chooses a user what one can see.
This company calls it "a personal armed knowledge."
Inrupt plans, according to business executive John Bruce, to bring up tools, systems and related skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Ree, Bruce, a process purchased by IBM, workers who promote the program and people of volunteer producers.
Since this week, international technology developers can produce a single program that all have developed using the Internet Web site.
Berners- Lee said that he and his crew did not speak "no Facebook and Goodle about whether he was able to produce major changes that would result in their business permanently.
"We will not ask their permission."
"Uerners-Lee wrote in the Medium on Saturday, said that the purpose of Inrupt "to provide an interest in business and place to help maintain integrity and the quality of the new Internet made by Solid."
In 1994, Berners- Lee changed the Internet while making the World Wide Web Council in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners- Lee has been the most influential voice on the Internet news service.
As soon as it is opened official Inrupt, Berners- Lee will still be the founder and administrator of the World Wide Web Consolortum, the Internet Center and the Open Data Center.
"I'm happy to pass through this new Internet section," adds Berners- Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victoria cross priest at WW1
The first and last week to receive the Victoria Cross during the World War.
Lt. Col. Priest Bernard Vann won the prize in 29 September 1918 during a raid in Ballelese and Lehauct.
Even so, he was killed by a knife - wielder who shot so hard that he died without knowing that in four days he would win his highest prize in Britain.
A memorial plaque was opened by two of his grandchildren in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says that the discovery of the stone is hard to forget because it has been discovered some 100 years after his grandfather received the prize.
According to London Gazette, in 29 September 1918 L. Col. Vans paid for the men under him to pass the Canal de Saint-Quentin "there is heavy fog and heavy guns and machine guns."
He later fled to the firing squad and took with him those huge guns and automatic guns.
Lt Col Vann was killed by Germany with a cat’s rifle that shot as far as October 4 1918 - more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, aged 72, says that his grandfather's actions are "a thing he knows he will never be able to do, but he said it is a humbling thing.
He and his brother Dr James Vann set a history that was made a circle after the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band went out.
Michael Vann says that he feels "of glory as he has had a great deal of youth." He added that“ the courage of the hero of truth is displayed by the people who give so many support.

"The government rule is that from six in the morning that the program was no longer appropriate, so they should change to include the children, "So says a representative of the advertising and communications officer of Bellador, when asked about what happened.
"Peppe the pig," yes."
Bellator Scott Coker said they would change their times next so that the UK viewers would see.
When I think of playing it again, I think it might be possible," says Coker,
"The problem is that time is six o'clock every Sunday for them will not be able to do this until Sunday on Sunday on Monday for them.
But we have a schedule.
I believe, when it changes through the multiplicity and all of it was not very pleasant.
In an effort to straighten matters out, we first assume that our problem was the machine’s problem.
But otherwise, it was the State’s problem.
I promise you never again.
We will bring five more wars to a finish and will try to bring more than what they expected but that we feel we have done much more.

Desert Island Disc: Tomley felt ‘ little ’ because of her sex
The Olympic saltman Tom Dley says that he grew up to be young because of his sexual appearance - but has given interest in his success.
This 24 - year - old tells me that I have found myself going to a second school to be "I'm not the same as other people."
Commenting on the original December Island Discs ruled by Lauren Laverne in Radio 4, he says that he spoke of homosexual rights to give them "hope."
He said that being a parent would lead him to no longer to take care of winning the Olympics.
A familiar director of the program, Kirsten Young, has fish for months because of illness.
Standing out as a condemned person in Laverne's first career,ley says that he felt the smallest while he was growing up because he was "not allowed to love boys."
She said: "Up to this day, the feeling of feeling small and different is the very things that have given me the interest and ability to succeed."
She wanted to present herself as a "something," saying, so that she would not be embarrassed by everyone's sexual appearance.
The winner who won two Olympic gold medals has made public recognition in the GLBT and has used his fame this year to the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to make it fair.
He said that he felt fortunate to be able to live without being caught up with problems and to offer to others a "hope."
This world winner three times fell in love with another man - Aviser of America in 2013 - "You didn't expect."
ley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than she last year, but said that their separate positions were not a problem.
"If you are faced with such things as young" - go to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, you say that it was hard to find someone of the same age facing the same life problems.
This couple became parents in June, having a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that “all his ideas" have changed.
If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I needed ‘ to get a gold ring, ’ that said.
"You know, there are great things to finish the Olympic Drum.
My Golden Age Ribbie.
Her son’s name is similar to that of his father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after a stroke.
He said that his father did not accept death, and one of his final wishes asked if he had any copies for London 2012 - since he wanted to continue.
"I couldn't say ‘ You won't be in the front row,' says.
"I took him by hand when he finished breathing and saw after breathing that he too could not live forever," he said.
The following year Daley competed with the Olympics of 2012 and received a copper medal.
"I immediately realized that this was what I had always dreamed of — to drown in the water before the crowds in the Olympics, I couldn't feel the best way, ” she says.
It also aroused his interest to say his first song, proud, by Heather Small - ited, which was always interested in the tops and threatened him.
The Desert Island Discs is obtained on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11: 15 BST.
Mickelson in the play form is put on a bench in the Ryder Cup game on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a new record on Sunday when he plays his 47thth Victory Cup game but has to change his way of playing so as not to make this uncomfortable record.
Mickelson, who plays this event twice a year in 12 C.E., is installed in a stage by Captain Jim Furyk in a game of 4 football with 4 people.
Instead of being seen by the crowds, as is the custom when playing the American game, this victorious winner five times used half of his day without playing and training himself for trouble.
He is unable to grasp even though he is at the top of the game, this 48 - year - old player is ill - suited to play in Le Golf National, where grass is present and it makes it difficult for players to play badly.
If the play field itself is frightening, Michaelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces Francesco Molinori, a very handsome British football Oppen, who has cooperated with this school boy Tommy Fleetwood to win all their games.
If Americans, less than 4 points, can properly start 12 solitary sports, Michaelson’s game will be more important.
Foryk showed trust in her husband as expected.
"He fully understood his role today, and struck me a little backward, and laid his arm around me, and said he would be ready tomorrow."
"You really trust yourself.
You find a place in the hall of fame and add much to the group in the past period, and this week.
I didn’t think she would play two games.
I thought he would play more games than we were, but they did not go as far as we thought they would be.
He wants people to get to know him, as everyone else does.
Mackelson will pass Nick Faldo’s record of playing many games on the Ryder Cup in the Church play.
It can make his choice of play on the Ryder Cup unlike his personal record.
Mickelson won 18 times, was divided 20 times, and convinced that he was present to the group.
"You’re funny, funny, quick - witted, quick - witted, and good to be with him in the classroom rooms" and explain.
"At the moment when you see young players laughing about him at this station, it's good to see what's going on."
He gives only a little pleasure at all.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that there can be a sudden loss of forward position.
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows that we can soon lose the forward position as the crew is ahead of the Ryder Cup but can change at any time.
The stadium was first played in 1997 in the game in Valderram, where the trial paid by Seve Ballestros was five points ahead of America but was completed in the latter, winning 141 /2-131 /02.
"You will tell yourself that you have many articles in Valokline; you have many articles in Brookline, where they are being raised and Valderrama, where we have won, hard times," says Bjorn, displayed in the photograph, after viewing the fair of 2018 victory in 5-3 on Friday and then in 10-6 issues of Le Golf National
So history will teach me and everyone in the group that you have not finished.
We will get rid of all that we have tomorrow.
We will do everything we should to do.
This has not finished until there are articles on the board.
We have a purpose, and it is to try to gain a victory over this race when we are looking at it.
Once again, I point to the 12 players at my side, but we know that we are facing anything on this one side of the whole world with the rest of the players.
Satisfied with the way his players played in this hard play, Bjor added: "I didn't really think of this.
The next day, we are talking about something different.
The next day personal playing skills are examined, and a different thing.
Having a partner in your life when things are going well, but when you are alone, you begin to feel more like an athlete.
That is the message that all players must be found, they must prove themselves tomorrow.
Now, you don't come with your partner, and he or she must show it again.
Unlike Bjorn, on the other hand, Jim Furyk looks at his players and not like a team, except Jordan Apeith and Justin Thomas, who received three to four notes.
Foryk was once the two parties of the last day, and was on the side of Brookline when he conquered and lost as Europe had made a "miracle in Mednah."
"I remember everything he said," answering Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, how he caught his attention when they were on their way to the last day.
"We have 12 games tomorrow, but you should not be thinking of that as you saw in Brookline and Mednah.
When you start winning every time, you put pressure on your weight.
We organize our players according to order and put them in a way that will bring good results, knowing, we want to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been given a job to pay back the war and face with Roy McIlroy in the high game, facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleeed, and Ian Poulter of the Yuppoons.
"I went along with this group of men with this plan because I think he is dealing with everything," says Bjorn in this choice of individuals.
The German Navy was revived.
A new German ship should be released in 2014 to enter the rank of warships known as the Cold War, but the following year it cannot be released because of the problems of the ship and the cost, says the news.
The release of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," a ship that paid for others produced by Baden-Wuettermberg-class frigates, has been reduced by the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit says a military spokesman.
The sailor should not have joined the navy in 104, but the cargo supply has made it possible.
These four ships of Baden-Wurttemberg in 2007 and will replace the Bremen ships.
It was known that there would be a powerful weapon, along with other torpedoes and aircraft and other technology that made it invisible to Radar, infrared and accoustics.
Another important factor is that it takes a long time before it needs repair - it can go away for two years away from home.
Nevertheless, further disturbances make these new ships, which are said to give Germany power overseas - they are out - of - date when launched.
This boar was released in the news last year, while the German navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to Blom & Voss in Hamburg
This was the first time the navy returned the ship to the creator after it was brought.
Little is known about the reasons for the ship’s replacement, but the German news is that there are problems "in machinery and clothes" that make the ship more efficient that has made this ship useless in war.
The machinery was more efficient as the Baden-Wurttemberg ships were used by 120 and half of the people required to use the old Bremen.
For one thing, it appears that the ship has a very heavy weight to reduce its ability and that the navy will not be able to improve it in the future.
This 2,000-ton ship "IRheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have survived a couple greater than the ships such as were used by the Germans in the second world war.
Despite jobs, the costs of all this work - including the cost of training employees to use - they are beginning to be a problem.
It is said to have reached £3.1 billion ($3.6bn) — beginning with £2 billion.2 billion
The problems of these new ships have become important when it is shown that the strength of the German Navy is losing its power.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peer Bartels, head of the German Parliament Security Committee, admitted that the navy was "defected ships which could go to war."
The officer claims that the problem is advanced over the years, since old ships have been discharged from the army but no new ones have been added.
He then said that there was no other ship in the Banden-Wurtemberg which was able to enter the navy.
The New Trust listens to the news about flying animals like rats
A new sponge made in the Scotish Highlands requires an explanation that the animals take advantage of their position to provide food.
It is hoped that the results will shed light on how the animals behave and how they can be protected.
This is the smell made by Scottish scientist of the National Trust to follow these familiar animals, which make a sound like sooprano, with long ears and the Daubentons at Inverwe Gardens in the West Ross.
A special recording machine will be placed in an important position at this site to determine what they do during the course of the year.
NHS staff members and volunteer workers will make their own paint with handheld machines.
Audiologists will perform recorded experiments to identify the freezers of each other and what this type is doing.
The habitat map of these babies and the report will be produced to provide a picture of the behavior of these animals.
Rob Dewar, an environmental adviser for NTS, hopes that the result will be a sight of the arrivals of these animals in whatever kind they are used.
These details will help you to know what are the benefits of protecting wildlife and how to maintain wildlife habitats.
The presence of animals in Scotland and UK has decreased a hundred years ago.
They are at risk because of the construction and development of habitats.
Airborne Turbines and light can put these animals at risk as well as flying newspapers and chemicals from buildings, as well as cats ’ attacks.
These creatures are not blind.
Even so, their daily appetite for food brings more attention to their ears than to their ears when it comes to handling food.
They pick up their food by venting their rage when returning to their ears, knowing what foods or obstacles they have to take during flight.
NTS, responsible for caring for some 270 old areas, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [66,000 ha] of land in the country, assumes that these animals are important.
It consists of ten trained experts, which are rehearsing, inspection of their living quarters, and sometimes rescue.
The center has made the exclusive view of these unique species in Scotland in the Threave state of Dumfries and Galloway, with eight species of animals
The local administrator, David Thompson, says that the site is a suitable place for them
"Here in Threave we have a beautiful area of these animals," says.
"We have old places, old trees and comfortable living quarters.
There is much that you can know about animals that are unknown to man, so the work we do here and other places will help us to explain what they need to live."
The importance of studying these animals before caring for land is important, he says, since the damage to the habitat of the animals could result in the loss of 400 children and quadruplets, which would conclude almost everything about that.
The animals are safe and illegal in nature, disrupting them and their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, officer of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged public assistance.
He said: "We still have much to know about these animals and many of their species we don't know how many.
Ronalo resisted accusations of bankruptcy and his lawyers would present a German magazine
Cristiano Rolando has called the rape charges false, saying that people want to be praised by his name.
His attorneys will publish the German news service Der Spiegel, which is the main source of the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus were charged with rape by an American addict, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in 2009
He is said to have paid $375,000 to say nothing about the event, says Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking of the aforementioned Instagram that has spread to 142 million of his followers just hours after these charges were made, Ronaldo, 33 years old, disagrees it with the word “false. ”
"No, but, just, only, but, only.
What they have said today, the lie is gone," the Ballon d'Or winner five times on the camera.
"They want to introduce themselves to the people by my name.
It is normal.
They want to be known by my name, but it is not unusual for me to do so now.
I am happy and ready," adding this player, laughing.
Ronalo’s attorneys offered to finance Der Spiegel with these charges that said to be “an unorthodox report of charges that abuse of personal life, ” according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schchertz says that the player wants to break the “spiritually damaged ” because of the abuse of personal rights in previous years.
The event is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a hotel called Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in the drinking area, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to go to the theater, where they raped him back, according to paper posted at the Clark County District in Nevada.
Miorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the trial and became the whole "righteous man" "99 per cent" problem is one percent.
They say that Ronaldo has assured the couple that they are together, but they agreed.
Miorga says that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later they agreed to speak without the courts because she felt afraid that she would return and fear of humiliation.
This 34 - year - old says that he wants them to get back to work because what Ronalddo says is still hurting him.
Ronaldo was about to enter Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the charge, and in this summer he went to the huge Italian group Juventus sold at about 700 million dollars.
Brexit: UK will ‘ forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK's "will forever regret it" if it does not lose its leading position in the production of cars behind Brexit, says machine secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was worried that Toyota in UK had told BBC that Britain could walk through the EU on the back of the interview that it would stop briefly to produce it from their firm in Burmaston, near Derby.
"We need a connection," says Mr. Clark.
This car manufacturer from Japan said that the tendency to speed off the flow of clothes from the border if there is no connection in Brexit could complete the task.
The Burnaston - produced Toyota Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90 percent of such attention to the European Union.
"My guess is that if Britain is moving through the EU at the end of Mashi, we will see a reflection going out of our production," says Marvin Cooke, head of Toyota in Burkiston.
Some UK automobile manufacturers have expressed their fears about leaving the EU without a combination of how to trade, including Hope, BMW and Jaguaar Land Rover.
The BMW, for example, will close its Day Product at Oxford for about a month after Brexit.
A serious concern about this can also pose a threat to the trade when there is no link in the Brexit.
The Toyota range is carried by the system "to arrive early," with vehicles arriving every 37 minutes from the UK and EU merchants for the purpose that the vehicles be produced for quick sale.
Even if the UK travels through the EU without a link in 29 March, there may be a disturbance in the border where the business claims that there can be a delay and insufficient goods.
Toyota will never have enough clothes for the day they are brought to the Derbyshire market, so the business will be stopped, and the display will stop.
Sir Clark said that Theresa May's plans for EU's communications are "inflammable to prevent this checkpoint."
"We need a combination. We need a very nice combination that will allow us to take this opportunity," telling Radio 4 BBC in a passage called Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers explains that we need to continue where we were with the most effective production.
Toyota did not appear as to how long a diagnosis would last, and in the long term, she warned that increasing costs will reduce the ability of competition by the time you finish the job.
Peter Tsoulberis, who has worked for Burkiston for 24 years and who has been in the Unite in this field, says that they are very anxious again. "The time I have spent working I know that if this work goes on, it will never return."
A government spokesman says: "Give us a reliable plan for future communication with EU.
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be reversed, says the American president’s office
An important meeting of Donald Trump and attorney general Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for another week as was the battle for the high court of Brett Kavanough continued, says the president.
Rosenstein is behind the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who conducted research on the disturbance of the Russian election, as well as the assembly between Trump and Russia and the interference of the legal arm by the president
If Trump chases him away from the universal lawyer, threatening Mueller’s independence, has been the cause of much gossip in Washington during the past months
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein said that he would wear something to record a conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the president with a redressing 25
Rosenstein submitted her report.
But on the last day he went to the White House, between the records, and then to cancel
Instead, a meeting together
Trump said he would "will not choose" to expel Royentein, but the meeting was slow to judge the dispute in the Commetehering Senate in which Kavanaugh and one of the sexual accuseds, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both gave evidence.
On Friday, Tump authorized a one - week study of the FBI on the issues against Kavanaug, which has delayed further the total Senate ticket.
Trump news correspondent, Msz Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein conference, he said: "The day that you didn't use, otherwise this week, I saw that a week's overtime was given all other things to the high court.
But we will see and always like to keep thepress update. "
Other scholars will argue: The Sanders failed to run the White House line since September 10.
Young Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the absence of arguments was not due to the interference of the TV 'mast' vendors," although he said: "I will not agree with the thing that they are watching."
He advised that direct contact between the Trump and the mountingpress.
"The President makes sessions for the Q&A and sessions more than any president before," he added without counting the evidence: "Look at those numbers."
Reports will happen, Sanders said, but "if the printer has opportunity to ask the president of America directly questions, it is better than to talk with me.
We try to do so and have seen him do much in the last few weeks and will take the place of a printed statement when you can speak with the president of the United States. "
Trump always accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or tying up conferences with the regular expressions.
News conferences are a disaster.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, making freeheeling and some rare occasions before he met the press.
The Health Secretary writes to the EU staff to NHS Scotland about Brexit
The Ministry of Health has written the EU staff of Scotland to the NHS to express their national gratitude and wish them to live in Post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until the UK was absent from the EU.
The government of Scotland has devoted himself to meeting the cost of the EU environment requests by residents working in public services.
In his letter, Msz Freeman wrote: "During the summer, conversations between the UK and the EU have continued, focusing on the expected decisions in the autumn.
But the UK Government has analyzed its plans about an unlikely situation.
I know that this should be a very disturbing thing for all of you.
That is why I want to renew my appreciation for the contribution made to the entire staff, regardless of the country.
The brothers from all over the EU, and above, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health service services, and take advantage of the sick and the people we use.
Skotland is your residence and we want you to stay here. "

Sales will be paid when they buy the UK property
Foreign buyers will be paid when we buy the UK property and extra money used to help the homeless under new Tory plans.
The increase will reduce Corbyn's success of driving to haul small votes.
The increase in station work will be paid for by those who do not pay taxes to the UK
The Nothwart too is expected to rise to £20 million per year to help the homeless.
Buyers of other trades are used to pay for the high level of military service when buying equipment at UK - and the extra money used to help the homeless, Theresa May will come today.
The increase will seem to be an attempt to reduce the success of Jeremy Corbyn's Dr.
The increase in the staff work will be paid by the people and non-paying offices in the UK, as well as additional incomes to improve the Russian service of fighting and sleeping.

Many rich areas of the country — especially capital - have become "city" because of the high number of foreign customers who spend their time in this country.
A new policy comes about weeks after Boris Johnson asks that the printery be removed to help new ones who have their own homes.
He persecutes large firms in the building of a high - cost building by removing the property but not using it, and urges Mrsz May to stop the platforms in the homes that are purchased to repair the "poor" of Britain.
Sir Corbyn has brought out a list of eye reviews, including rent control and removal.
He also wants to give many large councils to build new homes.
Msz May said: "Last year I said I would give your premiership to return the British dream — that life might be better for each new generation.
And that means repairing our house market.
Britain will remain open to people who want to live, work, and build their lives here.
However, it would not be convenient for the UK blind, as well as outside - based companies, to buy homes as hard-worked British citizens.
For most people the dream of homeowners has been far away, and the destruction of a painful sleep remains a reality. "
Jack Ross: 'My upper chest is controlled by Scotland'
The Sunderland Officer Jack Ross says that his "high desire" is to be head of Scotland in a certain point.
Scotts, 42, explains the challenge of restoring the bridge of North-East, now occupying the third part of the League One, three top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in this area after leading St Mirrorn to the Promiership for Scottish sea.
I want to play my country as a player.
I have B boyfriends and I, "Ross told BBC Scotland Sports.

Ross as head of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Canio
The former administrator of the Alloa Atarletic says that he did not have the courage to follow the cross-names in the main bridge, which has already lost places from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this time will be followed by 'May I return this package to the Prime Minister League?'
In view of the building and facilities in this game, there is no doubt that in the Premier League, "she said.
"It's not easy to find out there, but perhaps I’ll just check that I'll succeed here to return to the team."
Ross for only three years in his management baseer, later as a helper to Dumbarton and 15 days to Coaching stoff.
Then helped Alloa to break the introduction of the third eye, and changed St Mirrorn from the shared stage Championship level in the following case.
And Ross says that he feels more comfortable than he did during his playtime in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, Stirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"It was possible to be a reality," remembering, by taking Alloa.
"I really believe that the administration is good for me, more than playing.
It sounds so good because I did well, made a good life for it, and enjoyed a higher life.
But playing can be hard.
There are several things that you have to do each basket.
I still continue under conditions of stress and pressure on the job, but the control feels right.
I always wanted control, and now I do it, feeling free to be in my bag all my adult life.

The package poster’s label for mothers and cows to distinguish Internet opinion
The pump company has split the picture of online sales and an announcement that describes young mothers in closed cows.
To emphasize the development of what is called "the first of the breastbleblebump," the elvie company of technology company Elvie has released the content of the subsuc-in-cheek inspired video presentation to show new freedoms that the pump provides to announce mothers.
Four mothers have a dance in a barrn filled with cow smoke in the channels that include sounds such as "Yes, I'm a female, but you don't notice the tail" and "If you don't notice these things, they're not."
The chrus continues: "Ppp is out, pump out, feed the infant, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, take my daughters."
However, an advertisement, which is printed on the File page, has caused conflict on the Internet.
In 77,000 visions and hundreds of states, this video has received mixed answers from viewers, many saying that it means “missing" in the milk industry.
"A good solution uses cattle to announce this product.
As if they had to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless their babies are boiled in them before the days of labor, "write one.
Elvie's chest gun closely corresponds to the inside of the storage vessel (Elvie / mom)
Another said: "Stressing is clear to both mother and child.
But why not use them to publish pump pump to mothers who will save their children? "
Another person added: "Unseen in the trade."
Others protected the announcement, and one woman admitted that she had found a song "clean."
"I think this is a human idea.
I will be alone if I do it.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is somewhat painful, but I took it for granted.
This is a psychological product, "one wrote.
Another said: "This is a pleasant advertisement directed to the mother of the pumps (usually in their workplace or toilets) and feel like cattle.'
This is not a declaration praising or judging the milk industry.
The end of the video shows that all played with heavy - metal pumps.
The theme behind the project is based on the idea that many well - known women feel like cattle.
The Elvie Pump, completely silent, there is no wir or plague and has a tight grip on the inside of the hangar, gives the women freedom to leave, hold their children, and let them go out.
Ana Barrin, co-di-Elvin and ECD in Mother said: "Elvia's steam is such a revolutionary product that was due to the introduction of courage and touch.
By showing women and milk cows what we wanted to put breast - beating along with all the physical obstacles, while showing the fun and beauty of the new freedoms that will bring.
This is not the first Elvie pump to make a target.
During the week of Mondon's Mondon, the mother of two children appeared on the designer Act while Marta Jabowski was using this product.

The number of children used to move out though the flow of lunar borders remains unchanged, because of the section that heavy administration and control policies made by the Trump make it difficult to establish children and support them.
According to custom, many sponsors have become foreign, and they are threatening their ability to live in this country by further naming the child.
The risk increased in June, when governmental authorities announced that there was a need for assistants and other adult members in their homes to wear fingerprints, and that if the march will be shared with the authorities.
During the last week, the Stateus Albeance, the top authority and the Transfiguration Revolution and the Holocaust, testified before the Conference that the appeal is held by the majority of people who apply for the support of children who are not involved.
The Department later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests did not have reports of crime.
"Almost 80% of the population is either sustainable or legally supported by family members in this country, and a large percentage of these criminals.
So we keep on pursuing those people, “meaning Mr. Albecence.
In an effort to advance the children quickly, the authorities promise new rules that will require others to appear in court within a month of detention, soon after 60 days, the greatest of earlier restrictions, regarding the residential staff.
Many will appear to be a telephone contract, rather than a person, to justify their guilt in the case of a immigration judge.
Those deemed unworthy of freedom will soon be removed.
It is a long time for children to stay in a cell, saying that they can be anxious or depressed, this can lead to a successful end or to escape, according to leisure workers and reports that have appeared in the program in the months to come.
Proponents claim that this concern is raised in a large institution such as Tornillo, where the symptoms of the child’s weight can be enforced, because of its size.
They add that moving children to a tent town without providing sufficient time to prepare for themselves physically or to say that friends could undo many of the damage they had suffered.
Syria tells the US, French, and Turkish that it is dependent immediately
In view of the United Nations Assembly, Foreign Minister Waled al- Moualem also called the Syrian refugees home, although the war is now in the eighth year.
Mouleum, also serving as prime minister, has declared the foreign forces of the world of Syria illegal, under the sense of fighting the right, and is "to be considered worthy."
"They must drive out quickly and without restrictions," said the congregation.
Moulem stressed that “the war of the event is raging in Syria, where over 360,000 people died in 2011, and millions more were robbed of their homes.

"We have called the regions of the nations and human organizations for this payment," he said.
"They have pointed out what should be the concern of the people."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no restructuring in Syria until there is a political treaty between Assad and the opposition to end war.
The UN connections say that the recently 'new concordat between Russia and Turkey is built on the stage of the deep chain of the Illib's headquarters created an opportunity for the development of political expressions.
The Russian - Turkish language carried on a major attack against the Russian public, where three million people lived.
Moulem but stressed that the agreement had been "a long time" and expressed the hope that the participation of the war would focus on the jihhadsts as well as the A-Qaeda-commen associated with the Nurera Front, "to be destroyed."
UN delegate Staffan de Misstura hopes that he will soon include the first meetings of a new government-based committee and opposition to design the Syrian military policy and to pass the course of choice.
Moualem put conditions for supporting the cooperation of the Syrian Government on a committee, saying that the governor's work must be prevented from "the analysis of the points of the current constitution," and warned against disturbance.

Feinstein sent a letter writing about Kavanaugh by Fordon in July, and it lived in early September - but Feinstein had rarely seen that the prize had come from his office.
"I didn't hide the DrF Ford Report, I didn't fail his story, "Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"He asked me if I had caught it secretly and kept it secret as he requested."
But his denial did not seem well with the president, who said on Saturday nights: "I will tell you that, that was very bad for the body.
Maybe he didn't, but this was the worst kind of body I saw. "
To further the defense of the Supreme Court, accused of sexual immorality by three women, the president explained that the Democratic Republic is in use of their trials.
"They are determined to restore strength in any manner required.
You see the meaning, injustice, who are not concerned about who did the wrong, who must work to take power and control, the "Mediaite" reported the president.

Publishers in Paddington feared that students did not comply with the talking bag, a new publication showing
Bon’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said: “It’s hard to put it on the feet of the person you read just before it is printed.
I am amazed now we know about great success in Paddington. "
He says that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a book for children on a small tablet, would be a rare man about his work denied, adding that the book had been a pleasure "after death last year.
To Paddington, describing as “the most important member of the family, ” added his father automatically to his success.
"He was an old man, and he was not a proud man," he said.
"But because Paddington was true to her, it was difficult for her to have a child to do something: she is proud of herself though it is not true.
I think he had observed the effectiveness of Paddington in that way.
Although he was his creation and his idea, he always owed him a debt to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to sit on the phone
His daughter was rushed to a hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad always called it wrong, if she was not expected to do it," said Mrsz Edna-Lapehouse.
"After that I received a phone call from Nad if she said she was going to die within two minutes and I had to tell her.
And I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you very much, I love you.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
Doctors had given him chemotherapy to keep his heart beating faster and to give up his routine.
He was in need of some time before his hand, and all of this was banned.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all of that was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was placed in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold together.
Finally Sir Edna-Lapehouse, now grieved over the loss of her daughter, boarded an airplane with other passengers who were unaware of her problem.
"No one knew," he said.
"I was touched by my head, and tears were heard all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but it was in this atmosphere that I felt very kind to Nad.
If he needed my love and understanding.

Indicatives issued suicide - prevention cards in the Bridge
Two women who lose a loved one in suicide try to save others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards to the Welsh Bridge with encouraging messages and telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrsz Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to experience depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as I do every day," he said.
Mrsz Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lydney, said that his son was a promising cook with an infectious disease.
"Everyone knew it because of his smile.
They always spoke of her smile.
However, he quit work before he died, as he was 'in the dark place'.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the only one who could gain his brother after he was alive.
Mrsz Davis said: "I always worry that there will be a knock."
Mrs Davis made cards, "allow people to know that there are people on the outside where you can talk to them, even if I am a friend.
Don't keep quiet and need to talk.
Msz Humphreys, who for years had been friends with Miss Davies, lost Mark, his 15 - year - old companion, shortly after Mother’s death.
"He didn't mean he felt down or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed his change in attitude.
She was at the lowest entrance at Christmas, when the children opened their presents, she didn't compete with them with anything. "
He said that his death was a great victim to them, but they had to work with it: "Low the hole in the family."

Brett Kavanough’s future depends on the bank as the FBI begins research.
"I thought, if we could find something like what he asked for - time research, it is limited in time - perhaps we can enter a little unity," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he had been away from the committee for "division between the combined girdack.
Why did Mr Kavanangh and his republics want the FBI to investigate?
Their lack of it is due to time.
The final election ends at five weeks, November 6 - that, as expected, the Ribbishites do wrong, so they will be very weak in their attempts to find a man who wants to be elected to the highest court on earth.
George W. Bush has been on the phone calling the Senators, asking to be supported by Mr Kavanough, who worked in the West House in Mr Bush and met him and his wife Ashley, who was the secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happened after the FBI released its report?
There will be a vote on the Senate, where the Republics and the Democrats of 49 now sit down.
It is still not clear that Mr Kasanough can reach 50 votes on the deck of the Senate, which will allow Mike Pance, president of the president, to break the chest and convince him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea defector Number 'down' under Kim
The number of authorities in North Korea to South Korea dropped from Kim Jong-un in power seven years ago, said a South Korean attorney.
The Park Yeong-seug, which mentioned the chart from the South relations service, said there was a protection of 1,127 last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the border between North Korea and China and the higher rates for goods.
The Pyongng did not make public views.
Most of the orphans from North are eventually donated by South Korea’s residents.
The Seoul says that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority fled in China, the longest border in North Korea, and it is easy to cross over the Dlitised Bone Power (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China refers to the hosts as illegal migrants rather than refugees and repeatedly returns.
The relationship between the North and the South - officially employed in the war-of-one-speed-in-coming months.
Earlier this month, two world leaders met in Pyongang with talk directed at the symposium.
This appeared after the June history conference between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work on Korea's non-nuclear pencil.
But on Saturday, North Korean Minister RI Yong-ho says that the US sentences are due to lack of resistance to progress.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no hope for our national security and under such circumstances, no way will we use it for the first time," says Mr Rg in the National General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanough "a triangle," and says he is not ready to serve in the Supreme Court
Smaller General Nancy Pelousosi called the high Court of the High Court Brett Kavanarough "a triangle" and said he could not be qualified to serve in the High Court.
Pelos gave answers to Saturday’s discussion in Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help, but I think that if a woman ever did that way, they would have 'helped them,'" Peter said about his reply to the Kavanaugh witness before the Court of the Courts on Thursday.
Kavanaug was legally admitted to smoking with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
At the opening, Kavanaug felt a lot, sometimes shouting and talking about his family and his high school years.
He clearly judged the democracy on the committee, calling criticism about him for the "complement and organization of man" composed by rare institutions if Hillary Clinton lost the national choice of 2016.
He said that he believed Kavanaug, proof that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, for it showed that he was being abused in Democrats.
"I think you are ready for that definition and how they follow the Cantons and the Democratics," he said.
He was stressed when he was asked if he would attempt to interfere with the Kavanaugh if assuredly, and if the Democratic Republic received too much of the representative's House.
"I will say this - if he doesn't speak the truth in Congress or FBI, so he should not be a Supreme Court, but if he is present in court," Peter said.
The Kavanaugh is currently a judge in D.C.
Pelosi adds that as a democracy he was concerned about the judgment of the Kavanaug Act or Roe v. Wade, as viewed as the last justice.
In ensuring his detention, the Kavanaug had answered questions about whether he could alter certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not time for a dangerous person to go to court and wait to say, 'It''" says Pelos.
And wives want to protect it.
The diatribe is good, the moon and the years of the noise, and can't do it without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Mrs. Steinem said to me afterward.
"I don't think something strange, don't you?
He went on to say, "I was greatly helped by the woman who was a certain official in a certain place, who also cried when she cried, but produced a procedure that meant that when she was filled and started to cry, she said to the man she was talking to, "You think I am sorry because I cry.
I'm angry.
And he kept on walking.
And I thought it was wise.
Tears are allowed to flow in some way because they are unconscious.
One of my earliest memories is a man's office, where I found myself crying in an unutterable rage, had a scruff held on my neck by an elderly woman - I am always very afraid of who carried me to the stage.
"Never let them see them crying," he told me.
"He doesn't know he is angry.
They thought you were sad and would be glad that they came to you. "
Patricia Schroeder, then the Democraticwoman Society of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his conduct with the president.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in the outings of a ship called the Shishini of Monkey and left the race, Nks Schroeder, he was very concerned, he might have thought that there was no reason for him to have no idea of running the president himself.
"There was no good decision," she said to me to laugh after 30 years.
"There were seven heard in the contest, and the last thing they wanted was one.
One called "Snow White and seven favorites."
Because it was after the project, it was after financial support, and he vowed he would not enter the race unless he raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his clients who gave 1,000 money to men would give him only $250.
"Do they think I get a break?" he wondered.
When he gave his speech announcing that he would not engage in a legal campaign, he was stricken by feelings of gratitude toward his patrons, frustration and a system that makes it more difficult to raise money and target votes than the delegates, and anger on the xism - if he is matured.
"You think I’ll be disturbed," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about how the printer responded to him.
"You think Klenex was my client.
Do I remember thinking, ‘ They will fix it on my rock? ’
"Have you been"?
The way the US-China trade battle can be a good thing in Beijing.
The opening salvos of trade between US and China was deaf, and while the fighting was far away, internal conflicts can be useful to Beijing for a long time, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, dismissed the first warning at the beginning of the year by threatening foreign talks involving sun Poles, iron and aluminium.
The remarkable increase has been adjusted this week by new payments affecting $200 billion (U.S.), which are worth £50 kg), as well as US taxes from China.
Beijing is re-re-re-repaired, tiffs have just paid a fine ton per percent of America’s $60 million.
China has promised to compare US shot-shot-shot, and most of the economy of the world's largest size is unlikely to add any time soon.
To find Washington to return means to take up needs, but bowing down to the United States will be very embarrassing to X Jinping, the president of China.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards properly, the forcing of US wars can certainly help China more than long ago by reducing international dependence.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make the conditions that begin to discard us in this country is really more dangerous than the observers have seen," He says Abigail Grace, an active friend who has headed for Asia, says the new American Security Center, a thinking tank.
Syria 'has prepared the refugees to return, says the Prince of Nations
Syria claims to be ready for the return of refugees and encourages the restoration of a war - torn country for over seven years.

"Today the underground situation is certainly grateful for the progress made to prevent violence," he said.
The State continues to renew the damaged areas by covering over to restore tradition.
All the conditions now exist are the voluntary return of refugees to the countries in which they have moved because of the violence and the uninhibited economic values that center on their daily lives and lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in this country need help.
Al-Mouleum said that the Syrian kingdom would receive help to rebuild the fallen land.
But he emphasized that they would not accept help with restrictions or help from those who supported them.
