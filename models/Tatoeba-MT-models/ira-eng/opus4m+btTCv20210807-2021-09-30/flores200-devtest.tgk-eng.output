The process of moving on the way is the study of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the way they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of motion is difficult because it is impossible to predict driving behavior with 100 percent terminals.
Fortunately, drivers have a tendency to act very well within the range; thus, the transport flows are typically inclined to be reasonable, and they can be expressed mathematically.
In order to better show the traffic flow, between three main features of connection were restored: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
