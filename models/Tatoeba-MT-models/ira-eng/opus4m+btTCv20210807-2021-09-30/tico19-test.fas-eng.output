Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK, January 1 to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK confirming that, while in different countries, we are at a different stage of infection, but the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience from Italy, other countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who need healthcare, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a group of pneumonia cases of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was referred to as a coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence obtained so far shows that about 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
About 14% of cases, COVID-19 is becoming more severe, requiring hospitalisation while 6 percent experience critical illness that require intensive care.
The mortality of patients in the hospital is about 4% due to COVID-19.
In this study, we assess the ongoing trend of the coronavirus outbreak in each EU/EEA country and the UK (Italy) and compare them to Hubei Province.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, with that in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Subsequent to China, COVID-19 was released into more geographically, and the dynamic of this disease is currently taking place in the rest of the world.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
Spiteri and colleagues in the Eurosurveillance magazine reported the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe according to the WHO definition.
In the EU/EEA, three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020, from people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been identified in all 30 European/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), whereby from 31 December 2019 to that day, 39,768 confirmed cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 confirmed deaths and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), COVID-19 cases in various countries around the world receive only official resources such as the Ministry of Health, the National Health and the World Health Organization and the World Health Organization, being updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare them to the trends of the disease in Italy.
As a indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in 14 days, followed by the natural course of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK, on 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The total number of cases reported from each country on 15 March 2020 was 8:00 a.m. compared with those reported to Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February, and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This is mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increasing trends of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared with that in Italy for a period of 31 January to 15 March 2020.
This figure indicates that on 15 March 8 a.m., the total number of cases reported in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK compared with the number of cases in Italy in 3 weeks prior or less.
Our results indicate that the number of notified cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing almost immediately in all countries.
While countries are at different stages of the disease, the response to public health organizations is variable, and there may be different definitions and protocols in countries to choose patients who should be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including increasing testing speed.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy described a situation in which about 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% cases (data not shown).
To complete current surveillance data that focus on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths, this information should be collected in a systematic way.
A study conducted in 112010 found that access to intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe is very different from 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany to 4.2 beds varies from every 100,000 people in Portugal.
Countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 beds) and moderate care for every 100,000 population in 2010.
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with expectations for different EU/EEA countries and the UK regarding the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 cases associated with over 90% of the capacity of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update to rapidly assess the ECDC risk assessment.
Since cases are classified in certain areas of European/EEA countries and the UK, hospitals and intensive care sectors usually serve the population of a region, information about cases and special care beds should preferably be available in the list of domain units for statistics level 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience from Italy and the current trend in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who require healthcare, especially intensive care, such as the case in which Italy is occurring.
As noted in recent rapid ECDC risk assessment, a quick, inclusive, and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2 is necessary, with a rapid change from the containment approach to decline, as predicting the rapid increase in the number of cases if not too early, it may cause decision makers and hospitals not have enough time to understand, accept, and adapt their response based on this process.
The rapid risk assessment lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short chance for countries to be able to increase their control measures to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure on healthcare.
In this case, the lack of success is likely to meet the healthcare system of other EU/EEA countries with a wave of patients who will need special care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people, infecting 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humanity.
SARS-CoV-2 is also similar to its own virus, SARS, which caused thousands of people in 2003, and SARS-CoV-2 causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is more transmissible and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women.
In response to a large number of published content about the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the research that is rapidly expanding.
We will cover the basics about epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope that this review article will help to understand and root out this mysterious disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory to all Chinese who were forced to stay home for all holidays and weeks after the outbreak of the novel viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) as well as its associated disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to near 50 others all over the world.
As of March 2, 2020, over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and over 3,000 patients who died.
The World Health Organization warned that COVID-19 is the number of “one people” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), since the first report on January 7, 2020 in less than two months, over 200 articles on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, and treatment have been reported to determine the sequence of the virus isolated from the multiple patients.
In this review, we try to collect research progress in this new topic and rapidly developing.
If possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-caused disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an isolated in 2012).
We will also discuss the issues we have learned about taking care of and treating the disease as well as some other necessary questions.
CoVs have been traditionally considered nonlethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs twice, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with horrible outbreaks and deaths.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of the human outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin was reported first on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of the CoV was released.
On January 15, 2020 the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
The epidemic rapidly spread to the cities, provinces, and countries around it.
On January 20, the health care department was reported, and it showed that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the inhabitants of the city of Wuhan were quarantined at a distance, and public transport was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan Sea Food Market, which was considered the starting site of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has spread all over China and near 50 other countries all over the world (Figure 2).
Since the situation is rapidly evolving, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remain to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study in several centers on 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases presented a more updated picture of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
Persons with SARS-CoV-2 have a different age, but mainly 30 to 65 years of age.
Nearly half of the infected people (47.7%) were over 50 years old, very few were less than 20 years old and only 14 had less than 10 years of age.
People with SARS-CoV-2 are more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expanded in different clusters mainly in Hubei and around China.
The starting period of COVID-19 was an average of 5 days (2 to 9 days).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2 days).
The beginning period was 9.5 days (4.8 to 13 days).
The base port number (R0) was equal to 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the R0 was adjusted to 4.82.
The number of people infected with epidemiology was increased before 23 January 2020, with a busy time of transportation, before the Spring Festival in China.
The death rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the death rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 included sex (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses containing a single strand of sense RNA.
These viruses can be divided into four alpha-, beta, gamma, and delta, which are characterized by alpha- and beta-CoVs.
Phylogenetic acid (S) binds to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The RNA genome is released in cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms envelope-containing and cytoplasm, which then binds to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
By maturing more than 99.8% of the 10 samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultra-thin sections of human airway envelope.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than SARS-CoV, which is coincident with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the viral pathogenicity by preventing IFNβ. However, orf8 has no known domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of the human ACE2, with a total length of 2.9 amino acidity in combination with the B0AT1.
They found that the compound, which contained open and closed panels, was combined as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 combination could bind two S proteins, which could be evidence for CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Media and intermediate host
It has been known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civet cats and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are the native host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats SL-CoVZX45 and bat SL-CoVZX21.
However, the question that the intermediate host has helped the virus pass through species to infect humans is the response and the transmission route still needs more clarity.
Ji, et al., believe that María, which contains cohesive compounds within the S protein, has worked as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, based on 99% genetic similarity to CoVs discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2, say that eating pangolins might be a species of long-term fungal origin that is often used in traditional Chinese medicine - as a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1% difference spread in two genomes is still a lot different, so we are still waiting for definitive results for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV live in a dry environment for up to 48 hours and at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity in laboratory conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes, ether, ethanol 75%, chlorine-containing disinfectant, prophylactic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents other than chlorhexidine, and these can effectively neutralize the virus.
The human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and hence is susceptible to the novel virus.
There is currently no detailed study on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. (Fig.4).4).
In general, after the virus invades the host cell, the virus is first recognized by the host immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-type cell receptor, Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammatory factors, dendritic cells and synthesis of type IFNs, limiting the spread of the virus and accelerates the phagocytosis of the virus.
However, N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from the immune system.
The immune system will soon link to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ cells and CD8+T, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies and CD8+T cells directly kill infected cells on the virus.
T-help cells help to defend cells to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing apoptosis of cells.
Humoral safety includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also essential in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from the patient causing MERS-CoV neutralisation.
On the other hand, too much immune system can produce a large number of free radicals, which can cause severe asthma to the lungs and other members, resulting in the worst scenario of a few members and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, characteristic of a cluster of pneumonia, affects more elderly individuals with underlying conditions and pregnant women.
The common issue is that people who are exposed to a large amount of virus or their immune system function are more likely to be infected than others.
According to a study on the first 425 cases in Wuhan, China was the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 against 14-1 days, but it often takes 3 to 7 days.
However, the study on 1,099 cases suggests that the incubation period is 3 days on average, and is in zero to 24 days.
The more recent study shows, as described above, the incubation period is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2 days) based on statistics from 8,866.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing the spread of the virus from transmitting infected people to others without symptoms.
A common technique is that people who are exposed to the virus or infected with it usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the major and initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by no symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nose abdominal abdominal pain, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath after the onset of the disease or reduced oxygen in the tissues.
In severe cases, the disease quickly leads to the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity, and cardiovascular disorder.
Patients with fever, or acute fever, and even without pulmonary abnormalities in the radiographs should be screened for early diagnosis.
A population study in late December 2019 found that 98% of fever, 76% of dry cough, 55% of breath and 3% of diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilators.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from a person without a mark.
A 2012 demographic study found that fever (98%), dry cough (48%) and dyspnea (55%) were the major symptoms in patients with MERS-CoV.
However, 80% of them required ventilators, much more than COVID-19 patients, suggesting the higher lethality of MERS than of COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, it has been shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13%) were the main symptoms, and about 20%-14% were required to provide ventilators.
By February 14, and when cases of confirmed cases were reached 66,576 globally, the mortality of COVID-19 was about 2%.
In contrast, the mortality of SARS by November 2002 was around 10 percent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
According to a demographic study in June 2012, the death rate was calculated for theMERS 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
One previous study suggests that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 6.47, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) is about 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 range for SARS-CoV is only 2-4.
The outcome of SARS-CoV-2 was presented with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV from their symptoms, mortality, and R0 in Table1.1.
The above images suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but SARS-CoV-2 is less lethal than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
This controls the control of SARS-CoV-2 is much more severe than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
A cluster start often occurs in a family or from a gathering or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can be infected without symptoms for more than two weeks and cured patients discharged from the hospital can also transmit the virus again, which is an alarm for the increase in quarantine time.
In the early stages of the disease, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytics) in patients is normal or low.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count less than 4×109/L including lymphocyte count than 1×109/L, and aminotransferase levels increased and the presence of virus in blood was found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and red blood levels were often increased.
In patients with severe cases, the level of Dimmer, which is the result of fibroin degradation in the blood, and the number of lymphocytics was gradually reduced.
Nasophary abnormalities in chest radiography are seen in most COVID-19 patients, with the characteristic features of bilateral patch shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
In most patients, abnormal pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and advanced fibers highly endanger the individual’s air exchange.
The type I and II function disorder in pneumocytes reduces the levels of surfactant and increases surface tension, resulting in the ability of lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, any findings of chest radiography are worse than the extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the formation of pomalidomides, glass membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocytosis, and multinucleated sine cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease was consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the major criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the false-negative rate over this method, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations started to be used (which no longer solely relied on RT-PCR) to diagnose the disease in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of disease, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and necessary to have an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group proposed a protocol using the CRISPR-based slating methods to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects compound RNA fragments associated with SARS-CoV-2 on 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-10 copies per microliter of input) that would be carried out using a bar in less than an hour without the need for accurate price tools.
This hope is that a new method of testing can dramatically increase the accuracy and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with this new CoV, physicians can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while multiple therapies that are used to improve other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with anti-virus drugs, immune system suppressants, steroids, plasma received from improved patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma received from improved patients for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing for the production of the body and vaccine against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning, and possibly have weaker attacks on other organs with ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, functional dysfunction and failure of the respiratory system is the most important risk to detect patients and cause people’s death.
Thus, breathing support is vital to relieve the symptoms of the disease and saves the person’s life, which can involve the severity of the disease, including general oxygen, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilators and invasive mechanical ventilators.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to be supported by bronchi membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is a modified cardiopulmonial technique used for heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electron balance, prevention, and treatment of secondary infection, and septic shock, and protecting the function of vital organs is also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storm has been found to occur before an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response that features a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
The cytotype refers to immune cells to the release of a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multicompliant failure.
Repression of the immune system is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with asthma.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, has been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other treatments to suppress the immune system in order to prevent the cytokine storm include the module of the immune response guided by T cells; IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; JAK inhibition; Blinatumumab; suppressor of sending symptoms of cytope 4 and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, using steroids at high dosages was not beneficial in severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
It may also cause severe side effects, especially osteoporosis, and has dramatically adverse effects on improving disease.
However, short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate doses have been recommended to be carefully used for patients with COVID-19 who are in a critical situation.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been approved for the disease.
However, it has been found that intravenous intervention with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new anti-virus drug produced by Gilead initially to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Subsequent containment of other single-stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses was shown by remdesivir.
Based on this, Gilead has sent the compound to China to conduct a series of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected people, with very promising results.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, leopinavir/ritiron and ribavirin have been suggested as a potential treatment for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur after combined therapy with lipinavir/ritonavir.
Intervention of this treatment with other medications used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma received from recovered patients and production of antibodies
Taking blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to help treat other patients who suffer from similar diseases or to protect healthy people from that disease.
In fact, patients who have recovered often have a relatively large antibody in their blood to cope with diseases.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight diseases and other foreign objects and recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was taken from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was injected to 10 patients with it.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, before specific treatments are provided, the use of this method on a large scale requires confirmation and transparency.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overreform the immune response and create cytokine release syndrome that is potentially a life-threatening poison.
The concentration of the substance in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is very large to treat patients.
Fast production and rapid production of concrete that is sufficient to fight the global epidemic is difficult.
Therefore, the separation of B cells from improved patients and identifying the genetic codes of the endothelial, or the potential of effective antibodies against the major proteins of the virus, is more important and more functional.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of the pads.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat types of diseases in China.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the combination of different components in the formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of disease based on the theories of TCM.
Most effective components are still unknown or vague as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, TCM has become one of the most important treatments for COVID-19, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, for which patients with mild symptoms or patients with moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were diagnosed with effective treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rates of treatment for COVID-19 patients were observed in several Chinese provinces, in which 87% of the patients used TCM, including in Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%). In Hubei province, only 30% of COVID-19 patients were observed to use TCM, the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this comparison is not quite accurate because many factors such as the number and severity of patients should be considered in evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and her colleagues published a study to compare western treatment (WM) alone and treatment of combined WM and TCM.
They found that the time needed for body temperature recovery, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization in a group treated with WM+TCM was significantly shorter than the group that was only treated with WM.
Amazingly, the speed and complexity of symptoms (from mild to severe) were lower in the WM+TCM group than the WM group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group than the WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still awaits better controlled tests on larger scales and more centers.
It is also important to determine the mechanism of action and determine the effective components of the treatment method of TCM or their combinations if possible, which has raised the curiosity of scientists.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are often very afraid of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also suffer from person, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of this infection such as fever, hypoxia (polycemia in body tissues), cough and side effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroid can lead to more mental tension and anxiety.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric complications including severe depression, anxiety, nerve attacks, psychomotor excitement, mental symptoms, psychotics, and even suicidality have been reported.
Contact tracing is essential and quarantine, as part of the public health system to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak, can trouble people from the effects of contagiousness, quarantine, and stigma among their families and friends.
Hence, mental health care should be prepared for COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, people in contact with them, as well as the general public who are in need.
Mental support should include the establishment of mental health teams from various disciplines, transparent communications with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the transmission chain of the population and infected humans to susceptible hosts and are often used as a supplement to treat viral anti-viral diseases in control of emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to build vaccines based on the S protein to produce strong, durable, or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the impact of these vaccines in healthy individuals and their strict liver models and their protection against common viral infections between humans and animals should be determined before the clinical study begins.
This is probably because SARS has been eradicated 17 years ago, and no new case has been reported since.
In contrast, cases and clusters of MERS are still seen in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in the native regions.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmid, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral primal particles, and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Production of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an essential and critical task for controlling the epidemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the problem because of the long period required for vaccine production (average 18 months) and the dynamic changes in different types of CoVs.
COVID-19 has started to manifest the full clinical course among thousands of new patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually and without complications.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a predictive disease flow model is essential for health and health organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited facilities.
Based on clinical studies reported thus far, the following factors can affect the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs at the age of 30-65 with an average of 8,866 cases being over 4.7% of patients aged 50.
Patients who needed special care were more likely to have underlying complications and complications, and their age was more than those who did not need special care (the average age of the first group was 66 and the median age of the second group 51). This suggests that age as a predictor is a risk factor during the disease and determine the outcome of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 affects more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Past diseases and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care were more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arthritis.
Heart events were also the main reason for the death of SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes and cause liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases are strongly interdependent and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The C-reactive protein level in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or damage in the tissue and has been suggested to be a potential factor for disease, response to treatment and ultimate recovery.
The correlation of CRP level to the severity and prognosis of the disease of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition to this increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine quinone (CK) can also help predict results.
These enzymes are widely displayed in multiple organs, especially in their heart and liver, and are released by damage to the tissue.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of heart or liver dysfunctions.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues for the prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are a immune system suppressant that is commonly used as a treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in SARS patients, many improved osteoporosis suffer with chronic pain and life quality reduction.
Thus, if needed, steroids should be used at low dosage and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, since the COVID-19 outbreak many patients suffer from extraordinary stress as they often have been quarantined for a long time, experiencing severe uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and patients in their rooms.
Provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help improve these patients and avoid stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 is thought to have different epidemiological features from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or small symptoms in the first stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients with first-stage or incubation period can produce large viruses during daily activities, which can make it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV occurred when patients were severely ill and did not occur at the early stage of illness.
Thus, the outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe than the outbreak of SARS, and it is more difficult to control.
Great efforts are currently underway in China, including bans on lockdown in Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have been heavily affected by the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, and this indicates the process of the disease.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the viral downturn will last for 3-4 months.
However, others are no longer very happy experts.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which seems substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and believe that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in the middle of the nose and throat swab of patients who left the hospital for two weeks earlier and improved, which indicates that the newly identified virus could become a similar cyclical disease with influenza.
However, there have been promising signs in China based on reducing the number of new cases, which suggests that current strategies may be employed.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause one million people to die and half a million deaths.
However, via strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has eventually been controlled.
It is possible that like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 becomes weaker in disease and eventually disappears or become a virus with small diseases that live alongside humans.
A comparison of all COVID-19 cases with SARS and MERS in China (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmittable through coughing or sneezing, and possibly transmitted through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in feces that allows transmission of soil to the mouth.
In a new study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were caused by hospital infection, including 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, it should be very cautious in protecting humans, especially health care staff, social relief staff, family members, colleagues and even patients who are in contact with patients or people with the disease.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is masks, which can be used by surgical masks, and N95 respirators (series 1860s) which help control the spread of viruses.
The surgical mask prevents the passing of liquid droplets spread by potentially infected people by air or sticking to the surface of materials where they can be transferred to others.
However, only N95 (series 1860s) masks can protect the person from viral particles as much as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the viral particles can pass through it completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks that are placed on each other, health care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 (series 1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care providers should wear isolation gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus while he wore a N95 mask; the virus might have entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health and treatment staff should also use transparent shells and glasses when working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially infected areas, it is highly suggested that people wash their hands frequently with disinfectant soaps rather than try to stay home and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The distance of three feet (lesser) is considered as a suitable distance for people who stay away from the patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came into the human world as a new virus, its high homology to SARS-CoV, which was reported on January 7, 2020 based on deep memories of the spread of SARS in 2003.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center of Disease Control, said that the virus was low and that its transmission from humans was limited to humans, and that there was no problem with the disease to prevent and contain it.
This message significantly reduced the awareness of the risk among the public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time was missed to contain the disease at a minimal scale in Wuhan.
The disease control agencies in China may have a hard lesson of this and make fundamental improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should (1) be more careful, considering that every word spoken by health organizations is important for citizens and can change the attitude and decisions of people; (2) rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors and authorities, compared to the unusual information received from clinics is much more sensitive and respond to them; (3) rather than trying to encourage people to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages, and (4) to increase public awareness about the disease and improve community response to a period of time, deliver effective and effective guidelines.
The outbreak of COVID-19 began by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 in late December 2019.
In less than two months and in a while, the virus has spread all over China and near 50 other countries globally.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are similar symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of returned from SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are essential for containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects more elderly people than youth and more men than women, and the severity and death rate are also higher in elderly individual than in youth.
SARS was more lethal than COVID-19 (1.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even when they are symptomless whereas patients with SARS patients who are severely ill managed to transmit the virus, which causes more severe COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much more and broader than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients treated can be reinfected with the virus and their test results will be positive.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of virus spreading.
Due to such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several critical issues remain to be solved as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-CoV-2 are almost 96% genetic similarity, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
Which animal as intermediate did the virus transmit the virus from the original host such as bats to humans?
Without knowing answers to 1 and 2, we cannot efficiently cut the transmission, and the outbreak can relapse at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter respiratory cells and cause subsequent changes to the disease?
Does the virus also bind ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we can’t achieve the rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long is the outbreak going on?
How is the virus genetically altered during interspecies transmission of humans?
Will this disease become a disease all over the world, like SARS, disappears at least, or is it going to return in a period like influenza?
The answer to the above questions is necessary, but it may take some time to answer the above questions and many other questions.
However, we don’t have a choice with any cost that may be necessary, except to stop it as soon as possible and bring our life back to normal.
Animal origin of human coronavirus
Thousands of years of adaptation and adaptation have prompted the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as cold.
The emergence of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) showed that HCoV infection can be both devastating and dangerous.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its highest peak, but the symptoms were less similar to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a common disease between humans and animals, and recognizing the zoonotic origin of HCoVs helps us well.
Most HCoVs are bats that do not cause disease in their bodies.
Hosts that serve as intermediate reservoirs of some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has a direct impact on the prevention of disease in humans.
Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals can also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history, and animal origin, and interspecies transmission.
It is an important matter to compare different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genetic recombination.
All current outbreaks of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are discussed in this context.
In addition, the need to successfully change the host and the development of the virus for the severity of disease in this article is examined.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, consisting of a group of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, also called the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses, are Chinese because of the crowned morphology of apopular microscopy.
Structurally, CoVs have integrated genomes that share a similar structure.
Approximately two thirds of genomes include two large rereading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are converted into pp1a and pp1ab protein polymers.
The poly protein is further processed and produces 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 to 16.
The remaining part of the genome consists of the ORF, which is used for structural proteins such as Spike (S), alpha (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Several side proteins that are specific were encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV genera contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four strains (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the gene source of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers, and some have emerged as important factors for human epidemiology.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are the common alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs are HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL6 usually cause mild symptoms, like cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are highly pathogenic, causing respiratory tract infections in most patients and potentially causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and emergence of external symptoms.
The first HCoV-229E strain, known as B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms have increased our knowledge.
Indeed, the concept was widely accepted that HCoV infection was generally harmless until SARS spread.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003, one of the most devastating outbreaks in current time, infected more than 8,000 people, and its raw casualties were approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in an outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula spread to other parts of the world.
In 2019, the novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, was found to have killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 2019.
The alarm is playing and the world needs to prepare itself for the disease of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin, which includes bats, mice, or domestic animals.
There are several evidence that the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats has been well adapted to these viruses and that they play a significant genetic diversity without symptoms.
COVID-19 has created enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the animal origin of the disease provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving factors and limiting mutations of species.
It may also facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate host and intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2, and have important implications in the prevention of future spillovers.
In this review, we will review the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and disease of HCoVs.
Particularly, we highlight and discuss this common theme, where the parental viruses of HCoVs in their natural habitat are not common, but become more infectious after interspecies transmission to the new host.
We also review the trend of HCoV evolution in which the increase in viral pneumonia is often associated with a decrease in pathogenicity.
The current outcome of SARS-CoV-2 is also discussed in this regard.
Animal CoVs have been known to us since the late 1930s.
Before the initial isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal discharge of patients with common cold, different CoVs were isolated in various types of animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery as time (Table 1) can be both informative and containing good information.
In 1966, the sequence of HCoV-229E was samples from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection, and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell cultures.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented with common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough seen in 10-20%.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture in the laboratory, gradually entering the brains of small mice.
Clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229 E, which are not readily understood by other respiratory infections such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 are both distributed globally, mainly during the winter season in temperate climate.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week and then the disease lasts approximately two weeks.
According to studies conducted on human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild cold.
In just a few patients with an immune defect, the severe respiratory infection of the lower respiratory tract was observed.
The SARS disease, also known as epidemiology, is the first infectious disease in human history, caused by SARS-CoV and the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
The SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 cases, and 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
Apart from the super-spreading modes, it has been estimated that any case can infect almost two other cases, the incubation period is 4 to 7 days and the peak of viral load on the tenth day of illness.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially presented with muscle pains, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as later symptoms.
Lynphopenia, deranged liver function tests, and bronchostin increased, are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
The extensive destruction of alcohol, reproduction of epithelial cells, and increasing macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
In recent years, about 20 to 30 percent of patients needed special care and mechanical ventilators.
In addition to lower respiratory tract, multiple organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney were infected in acute cases, usually accompanied with a cytokine storm that could especially have a immune defect in patients.
The virus was first sampled during the operation of the open lung tissue of a relative of the index patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made to investigate HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found that the disease was common in young children, older patients, and people with a lack of immunity with respiratory diseases.
Zimmerma, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
In another independent study, the separation of the same virus from the nasal specimen of an 8-month-old son suffering from the nature of pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually spread globally.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL633 is associated with obstructive inflammation and is also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to the natural cause of pneumonia and bronchitis, it has been reported that HCoV-HKU1 is associated with acute asthma severity.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
These four families have been transferred through society, well adapted to humans and are generally less prone to severe diseases, though cases occur for unknown reasons, for example in rare case have been reported, a poor form of HCoV-NL63 infection in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and maintain their continuous transmission to humans, the severity of virilosis or ovarian illness decreases.
MERS-CoV was isolated from the lung of a 60-year-old patient suffering from acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus are excluded from the Middle East, imported cases with secondary spreads to close contacts in different European countries and Tunisia have been reported.
Another outbreak in South Korea was confirmed by 186 in 2015.
The emergence of MERS is similar to that of SARS, which is characterized by acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is a common cause of MERS among HCoV-specific diseases.
More than 30% of patients had gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high fatality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses known to humans.
From mid to late December 2019, clusters of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection, which had changed SARS-CoV-2, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and called the disease COVID-19.
By third, as of March 2020, the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 90,053, and the percentage of raw casualties was 3.4%.
It is worth mentioning that the death cases in Hubei were 4.2%, while outside it was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, seen as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
It is a type of osteoarthritis that is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree due to 82% nucleotide sequence homology.
Apparently, SARS-CoV-2 has lower pathogenicity than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV.
Some people with SARS-CoV-2 had no symptoms, which could help with its rapid spreading around the world.
The contrast and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and significant differences.
The first thing is that the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows features that are usually seen in infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including non-specific, mild or even in some cases without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen on the infection of SARS-CoV, although the ratio is a bit lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns in community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it should be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages in humans as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some cases, should be clarified by future studies.
It is also of particularly great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might be seasonal, similar to other community-acquired HCoVs.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including the transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spreading after passages from person to person will affect the ultimate fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
All four community-acquired HCoVs causing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it might be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be the survivors of all ancient HCoVs.
HCoVs that caused severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have now perished.
For this to happen, HCoVs have to replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and more people suffer from the disease, there will be a greater chance for perfect adaptation to humans.
The virus will be difficult if it adapts well, prevent its transmission in humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
Several years ago, four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human societies, causing common cold in people with a healthy immune system.
These viruses do not need an animal source.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans and their transmission within humans cannot be sustained.
These viruses require maintenance and dissemination in their zoonotic reservoirs and are prone to the chance to infect human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
The virus, like other community-acquired HCoVs, has high transmission capability at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and more pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It should wait and see whether the virus is fully adapted to humans and whether it is transmitted between humans without a reservation (s) from the intermediate host or animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, assessing the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.
If the animal harbours a closely related virus that has high homology to the level of nucleotide sequence, the animal serves as the evolutionary host of HCoV.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted to the host and is not a disease for it.
Likewise, a reservoir host, one unregulated, long-term and long-term reservoir of HCoVs.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its parental viruses.
In contrast, if HCoV has its intermediate host prior to infecting humans, or about the same time, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic reservoir of human infection, and increase the level of infection in humans as a amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans.
HCoV can cause deadly infections if it cannot sustain its transmission within a stable intermediate host.
On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate hosts and stay in the host group for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host acts as a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data show that the first person infected with SARS had been involved in hunting animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations show that the level of SARS-CoV anti-SARS-CoV antibodies is higher in animal products than in normal people.
For the first time, a number of masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a racoon dog in the live animal markets were detected by SARS-CoV, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
Meanwhile, it has been reported that masked palm civets in the woods or farms not marketed in the live animal markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV.This suggests that masked palm civets might only be the intermediate and amplifying host, not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Note that 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, so it is not possible that multiple species of small mammals might also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.
In the later search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV, a type of coronavirus that harbours a great deal of bat coronavirus, a bat CoV HKU3, associated with SARS-related bat CoV SARS, SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), was found to be live in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The virus and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have been developed for a new theory that says bats are the host of new human epidemiology viruses.
A number of SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but none except WIV1 have been able to isolate the virus lively.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1, obtained from bats, revealed that ACE2 was used as a receptor for cell entry.
The interesting thing is that the head of patients who improved SARS had the ability to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 was associated with 95% nucleotide sequence, the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats.
Although there is a large proportion between these two types of virus, it is generally believed that the WIV1 virus is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and bats, the intermediate host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV to a similar group, such as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV utilize the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV was found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 are similar in sequence only 87%.
Thus, bats cannot be the reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are positive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, which also applies to the Middle East camels living in Africa.
Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, indicating that camels serve as the true reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that symptoms are generally mild and highly pathogenic in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels spread the virus not only through respiratory tract but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for virus shedding from bats.
However, one of the questions that remained unanswered is that in many cases, MERS has no contact history with camels prior to symptoms, which is likely to be attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes that include unknown animals species.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide sequence homology with the novel CoV RaTG13 isolated from bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to assign parental relationship.
In other words, bats cannot be the reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat CoVs are found in future.
Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, in which many of the initial cases of COVID-19, should be among the wild animals sold and killed in the Huanan Seafood Market, which indicates the potential animal-to-human transmission.
Recent studies based on meta-analysis suggest that a group of small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) can also harbour ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
This new genetic type of CoV genome contains about 85 to 92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, these viruses are closely related to about 90% of nucleotide sequence similarity as well as RaTG13.
These viruses are clustered into two lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a similar receptor binding domain with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identical amino acid sequence identity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more different, of course, with a higher degree of sequence similarity across genomes.
In a previous study conducted on diseased pangolins, it is reported that from lung samples, fragments of viral isolates associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different methods of obtaining handmade sequences and hand modifications to form a part of the genome sequence that formed around 86.3% of the genome length of the virus.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has a origin of pangolin SARS-CoV-2, which exists between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be achieved.
While the largest sequence homology has been found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, beta-CoVs related to beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genetic sequence homology.
It has been speculated that high degree of similarity between the RBDs of beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
A different proposal, however, is to support the re-combination of beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is common among beta-CoVs.
Judgments about the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are not complete.
Apart from many HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 is also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E might have originated from bat CoVs, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are found in rodents.
It has been reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolored bat displayed close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV- 229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, termed Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while complements are also suspected as the intermediate host of the virus.
To clarify the information, findings about the zoonotic origin of the known HCoVs have been summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans through my gut, a pandemic of respiratory infection was formed.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
A alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans not alpacas might interact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with the alphapas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV causes an outbreak of respiratory disease in animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of infectious viruses in humans, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, whereas bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene treasure of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels might serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans exactly as well as those seen in MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was evident from the very beginning of identification of the virus and subsequent findings from this theory.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich reservoir of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, busy colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all reasonable conditions for bats that make him an ideal spreader of the virus.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered dromedary camels for decades.
The virus is well adapted to these camels and this camel has turned from a intermediate host to a stable and natural host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and in these animals, they have relatively low mutation rates.
The interspecies transmission of the virus to humans is a random event and the dead-end host is MERS-CoV, as its transmission cannot be sustained.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if therefore, play a role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
It is especially true that pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
These animals might be the host of a SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
There are several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans that should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, bats could be the host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings may have a shared ecological location with bats through butchering or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of intermediate amplifying host to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced.
Human beings are infected with the virus through the consumption and consumption of hunting meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals is essential in terms of Python.
Third, as described above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 might have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still on.
Apart from different types of the animal hosts, three other factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers.
First of all, the relatively high mutation rates in their RNA replication.
The estimated mutation rate in the novel CoV, with a typical average substitution rate, is about 10-4 substitution per site 2, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to a new host, which can be considered “moderate” as compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses.
CoVs have a fault-containing exoribonuclease that can lead to very high mutations, metastases, or even beyond survival.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir inhibits the synthesis of these exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is about a million times higher than the host.
In addition, mutation rate is high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggestive of a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Probably, the virus has already adapted to another host that is close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.
Theoretically, genetic change may rapidly affect vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts phylogenetic flexibility in genome modification for genetic mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution, which is suitable for the emergence of novel CoVs.
This is supported by a lot of unique open reading frameworks and protein functions that are encoded towards the end of the 3' genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently modify the patterns during RNA replication through the cytopathic mechanism of the virus.
In a host that serves as the mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during CoV transcription.
Long-term and highly homologous RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
In both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat-CoV and batCoV-HKU9, phylogenetic evidence has been found for natural recombination.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to three viral factors described above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another key factor influential on interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is regarded as a typical sample, showing evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission event.
A comparative analysis between isolates of human and SARS-CoVs is thought to be that SARS-CoV has a rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein.
Generally, the RBD in the S protein of the CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and stimulates the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, it is located in the 318th to 510th amino acid transporter, which binds to the human ACE2 and its core receptor.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only the remaining 6 amino acid residues are different from human and civet viral samples in the RBD, and four of them remain in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which might increase the desire to interact with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be critical to viral adaption to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares a similar cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implicates that the binding affinity of the S protein with human ACE2 might have altered.
Indeed, a cryo-EM study indicates that there are at least 10 to 20 times the desire for this binding between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether another common receptor is required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with another part of S.
There are many HCoV receptors, such as aminopidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also explain the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other host dependent factors and restriction factors.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and rodents might prevent interspecies transmission.
For a successful interspecies transmission, HCoV must be controlled by host dependent factors and eliminate host restriction factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction must be identified and characterized.
The fully neutral screening of the host dependency on genomes and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the Advanced CRISPR technology might be fruitful.
The advent of new HCoVs: from the beginning
The diversity of bat CoVs has provided ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this case, bat CoVs serve as the reservoir host of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, obtaining or losing new protein encoding genes has the potential to change severe viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans, as it was found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins after a SARS-CoV-2-related bat virus isolated.
The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is seen in isolated windows at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be adaptive mutation that helps change the host.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant areas were identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination locations were identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
It has also been shown that MERS-CoV has successfully adapted recombination events between different ancestors who occurred in the dromedary camels of Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, a recombination event has also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, which are likely due to the release of viruses from selected pressure, such as by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of ORF4 with a full length of HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the two nucleic acid removal.
Although ORF4 was not completed and could be observed in SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, alpaca alpha-CoV with a more recent renal amino acid transporter results in altering the frame.
The final point is, of course, not least, that the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
The presence of mild symptoms or symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, which showed a mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
bats appear to be well adapted to CoVs anatomical and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the damage caused by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cell in bats is suppressed due to the reorganization of the killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the lower level of tissue adaptation of large complex I class molecules.
In addition, a high level of hydrogen-containing oxygen species (ROS) that is caused by metabolic activity in bats can also suppress CoV replication and affects the return of the immunoglobulin effect, thus providing a selection pressure to produce highly pathogenic strains of the virus when entering a new host.
The strains of CoVs that are most pathogenic may result in recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not by chance that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
These viruses replicate without a strong host immune response.
Here’s a secret why pregnancies are seen without symptoms and what causes severe conditions in human development.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the severe activity of the immune system and the cytokine storm, where the immune system is stronger, the damage to the lungs will be more severe.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is separate from CoV replication.
The separation strategy of the immune response system may have beneficial effects in treating SARS-CoV-2 medication.
Interference responses in bats are particularly strong.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
With this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose.
Whereas a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there is also a bat beta-CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Whereas civets and other mammals were the reservoir of viruses like SARS-CoV, the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 were not yet identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs closely resembled SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolins might serve as one of intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is made either deliberately or accidentally, of course, that there are questions in this regard.
CoVs have returned to the center of attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
A comprehensive evidence has shown that MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are bats, and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and civets in the markets, it could effectively end the SARS disease.
By the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the Huanan Seafood Market to prevent zoonotic transmission to humans, which is the reason for discovery of several lineages of pangolin beta-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
However, clearing how SARS-CoV-2 transfers from pangolins and other mammals still need future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long existed in dromedary camels.
These camels are considered an important tool for transportation as well as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for local people.
These camels are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels as in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spreading of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the frequent outbreak of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to produce effective anti- MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, along with other infection control criteria.
Because we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause a disease outbreak.
A variety of common CoVs between humans and animals are circulating in the wild.
Particularly, bat CoVs with animal-to-human transmission potential are so diverse.
There are plenty of opportunities that these common CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are highly transmissible and courseless.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be avoided to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the ordeal that SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, we should have a better schedule for preparedness and response.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They are in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance to grow up.
Although bats have many features that favours the spreading of viruses, the chance for humans to stay away from them can be minimized if people are educated to avoid them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is essential for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, and it will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and its outbreak.
As a result, the most effective way to prevent common viruses between humans and animals is to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of common viruses between humans and animals.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been found.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be of interest to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could remain in a shared ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, how humans contact bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
And finally, since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both care and intermediatent should be conducted.
A bat, pangolin, or any other mammal, is expected to be detected in its natural hosts in future, SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical.
Continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 on a suspected case of China and the confirmed cases of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid guideline for diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which is our experience provider, and is a good reference for fighting this disease all around the world.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increases based on research findings in progress and clinical experience; hence, diagnostic strategies and treatment are continually updated.
In this article, we provided a comment on our guideline and provided the newest diagnostic criteria of Pembardy and Limard confirmed China based on the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is now officially named as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the virus is also named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
Our team, in order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 disease, published a rapid guideline and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
This guide has attracted a lot of attention since the release.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on research findings and clinical experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are continually updated.
For example, Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), among 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, has issued a total of seven times in which some texts have changed.
Now Zhou and colleagues have provided an insight into our guide, which includes simple recommendations based on their clinical experience.
Their paper added new evidence to our guideline and also raised valuable reference for the pandemic worldwide.
We acknowledge their outstanding work and acknowledge our appreciation.
However, their paper should be updated according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Trial seventh version) and recently studies.
According to the 7th edition (3 March 2020), to confirm suspected cases, one feature of the history of all diseases should be combined with two cases of clinical symptoms to provide a comprehensive analysis, or if there is no history of all clinical symptoms, it should meet three of the following clinical symptoms:
History of all complications: (1) travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities in which COVID-19 has been reported within 14 days prior to symptom onset; (2) a history of contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contacting patients with fever or respiratory illness from Wuhan city and surrounding areas and or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported within 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contacting with confirmed cluster (more than 2 cases or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, class, school, etc.).
Clinical symptoms: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristic of the infection of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing that the typical number has decreased lymphocytosis in the early phase of the disease.
Diagnosing cases should be based on suspected cases associated with one of the following underlying health conditions or serological evidence as follows: (1) bluish PCR for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequences showing high homogeneity with the novel coronavirus. (3) It is positive for the specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody testing of SARS-CoV-2; or a specific antiviral antibody change of SARS-CoV-2 from negative mode to negative, or an increase of more than 4 times in the recovery phase.
We can see that the PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) edition.
The detection of pathogen was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); and then the serium evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes have been based on the ongoing work of researchers looking for a series of optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and also supported blood sampling based on the respiratory tract, which has been further accessible to different samples and supports the positiveness of a specific antibody in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there are more evidence to warn us that we should be careful with the unusual symptoms and patients that lack symptoms.
Hence, the chart of Zhou and colleagues should be updated, as it has been classified in the individual fluorescent that does not have clinical symptoms as subclassical.
The score system should also be verified in practice and with more clinical studies.
To collect, we hope that more evidence and evidence will be raised, and we want readers to provide their comments.
To identify suspected subsidies and verifiable subsidies, we suggest that doctors have tracked and followed the newest guidelines of their countries.
Our team will also regularly guide the guide to provide assistance to the day.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, a daily highest
Yesterday, Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
These statistics have been the highest number of daily casualties due to the virus.
Yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that cases of infections, including 114 active cases, and 33 recovered cases that rest at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR in an online news session said that the number of deaths, four men, and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two over 60 years old, two cases between 50 and 60 were between 41 and 50 years old.
He also added that two of the victims were from Daka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
One of the hospital staff told Anadolu news agency that one of the people died, the glory of Caffur Rahman, was one of the directors of Bengal’s Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at Kuwait Matre Hospital.
On Saturday, Obaidul Quader, Minister of Road Transport and Bangladesh Bridges, announced in an online video announcement that public transport will be shut down until next Saturday, more than planned first.
The public transport holiday began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods - medical goods, fuel and food - continued.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was on March 8, two passengers returning from Italy as well as their wife one of them.
On March 19, these three men recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more than one million people worldwide
Johns Hopkins University data shows that on Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections surpassed one million worldwide.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by CoVs.
With the first confirmed case of coronavirus infections in Malawi, and the first death of coronaviruses in Zambia, this day became a turning point.
On Thursday, North Korea claimed the country was one of the few non-precedented countries of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases by yesterday, including 79,332 of them, about twenty-four hours before the ten-day Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, over 244 thousand coronavirus cases have been recorded, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS NEWS reported on Johns Hopkins University data that over 1,000 deaths were recorded in the United States on Wednesday due to coronavirus infections.
Different countries around the world have adopted stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city to 1.
President Vladimir Putin said the rights and wages of the Russian people will be paid to 30 April without the need to go to work.
The Portuguese parliament voted for the extension of the national emergency for 15 days; the law was approved with 215 votes in accordance with the vote, ten vote of protest and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended travel restrictions in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to all the hours of the day; previously, the curfew was only run between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand has planned to implement travel restrictions between 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Mike DeWine, governor of Ohio, announced the state had extended home-to-house quarantine restrictions until 1 May.
Australian stores reduced purchases of toilet toilet paper for every time
Wolworths and Coles chains in Australia, on Saturday and Sunday, reduced toilet purchase restrictions on all the country's surface stores, respectively, to two and one package for each purchase.
ALDI also announced a purchase limit on Monday.
These limitations have been announced in the form of messages on the boxes and on the Facebook page of these chain stores.
Buyers are afraid to self-quarantine due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
Also on Wednesday, Woolworths limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes followed the previous four-pack limit to each purchase, which was announced in March 4 and March 5 by Woolworths and Coles.
The Coles Store in its March 8 press release announced that, despite the limitations of a four-packed purchase, many stores will be over within an hour, and read the demand below an unprecedented date, the ALDI Store also described it in its Facebook page on Tuesday.
According to the words Wolworths, the sales rate had experienced a severe fluctuation in the last week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the allowed purchase rates to two packs last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coles has ordered bigger packages to suppliers and increased delivery frequency to stores, Woolworths has ordered more available available. ALDI has made available available available available available to one of the most special sales plans on Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers try to increase their inventory, but local council restrictions on the timing of goods delivery trucks have made it difficult.
He said the production costs are expected to increase because suppliers are trying to respond to demand and the special sales will be lower.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores were not able to hold a Wednesday special sale due to the early supply.
Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology in a report in News.com.au, said the stores fill their stock every night.
He added that the bulking of toilet toilet toilet leaves the store store stock in small numbers, and when the product ends, it leaves a lot of space in the cages and induces a lack of sense.
Russell Zimmerman at ABC News said that Coles and Wolfworths believe that if there are a lot of products in the cage, if there are products such as toilets and disinfectants available in high numbers and they may be able to buy, you will likely be less afraid and frightened.
Who Gives a Crap, the manufacturer of the recycling toilet last Wednesday said their inventory has been over.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet toilet, and Solaris Paper which produces sorbent toilet paper, stressed that they operate 24/7 to be available to respond to demand.
Domain.com reported one of the most active sites in the real estate that when it was held on the long weekend of the working week, fewer auctions were offered to the first bidors in Melbourne, toilets were free.
The Thursday edition of NT News, which is one of the Darwin newspaper, had a special 8-bit letter to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia on March 3, these stores were originally reluctant to impose restrictions, stating that they had no plans to implement restrictions on the purchase.
Russell Zimmerman added that there are also many applications for other goods, including masks, disinfectants, dried goods, liquids, and hand washing soap.
Out of Australia, the English online supermarket Ocado, the Sunday evening saw the restrictions on purchasing toilet Andres toilet paper to two 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19, which is caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the pandemic.
Although the word cypandmicism refers to the extent of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous it is, the WHO emphasized the need to drive governments to counter-terrorism measures:
All countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO, said that countries would detect, test, treat, quarantine, and prepare their own surveillance.
We are deeply concerned, both by the alarming level of the outbreak and its severity, and by the alarming level of appropriate action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former president of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is unprecedented.
In a statement published by CNN in February, he said, \"No other respiratory virus has been denied until a continuous global outbreak.\"
Ghebreyesus said in a similar statement: “We have never before seen a pandemic, which has been caused by a coronavirus.”
He continued, and we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time.
The new status as a pandemic after the WHO decision was declared in January, where the outbreak was declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said of the outbreak: \"It's getting worse.
Associated Press reported on Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and was declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is approximately 4% estimated while globally ranges from .08% in New Zealand to 13.04% in Algeria.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Its complications may include the inhalation of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from onset to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but can range between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific treatment for it.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, avoiding other people, monitoring, and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities of the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, military government, hazard controls, and containment measures.
The pandemic has led to severe socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of resources exacerbated by drug purchases.
Schools and universities have closed in 193 countries or nationally or locally, affecting 99.4 percent of students and students around the world.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people and other people who have race, appearance, or appearance, in East and Southeast Asia, as well as those with widespread viral spread.
Due to travel restrictions and closures of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
These were mainly related to the major market of the Singapore Sea Foods, which is why the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a novel virus closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV.The first known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and the person did not have visible connections to the later group of seafood markets.
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post claimed that a case had been denied on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old man from Hubei province who could be the first to develop. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, despite the decline in China, there was a sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, and for the first time the number of new cases outside China were taken in China.
The number of cases may be reported significantly lower than the fact, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, a relatively small number of cases reported among young people were reported, and 19-year-olds and only 2.4% of cases worldwide. British senior scientific adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that about 60% of the British population had to be affected to become effective in achieving collective safety.
For cases, the number of people who have tested for COVID-19 is determined by their testing of positive official protocols.
By 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted official policy, have not tested people with only mild symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that up to 23 January, about 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been identified, and that these had not been registered, the source of infection was 79% of the cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of cases in Italy was significantly over-reported.
The initial estimates of the basic baseline number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention and Control found that the number could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the distance from the onset of symptoms to death was between 6 and 41 days, and the most common period was 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February about 80% of deaths and deaths were in those over 60, and 70% were infected with underlying health conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.Official figures from the number of deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who tested positive for COVID based on official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, as this figure may not include people who without testing - e.g. at home, in nursing facilities, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the pandemic was around 5-4 times higher than the official death and death rate of COVID-19.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said we know that [the death and death figures] are less likely to be true, including those with lower case fatality reports in the United States. Such measures often occur in pandemics, including in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines and the first death outside Asia on 14 February in France.
By 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and government territories were reported in all continents except the southern polarity of death and death. Various measures are commonly used to measure mortality.
These numbers vary based on the region and over time, and from testing, health system quality, treatment options, time spent from initial outbreaks and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health status. The death rate is achieved by splitting the number of deaths on all cases diagnosed in a time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate by 10 April 2020, is equal to 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number is different in each area.
In China, the estimate of mortality from 17.3% (for people who started their symptoms from 10 January 2020) was reduced to 0.7% (for those who started their symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measles include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of those infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not have time limit and follow a specific population of the case to resolve.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford University of Medical Evidence estimates that the infection fatality rate for the pandemic is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum estimate of this range is consistent with the results from the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany, as well as a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO emphasizes that the pandemic is in control.
In the case of China and the ultimate duration of the outbreak, it cannot be explicitly commented and may be different based on location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated that infectious diseases begin to decline if an action is not taken to control them.
But now, it is impossible to provide any reasonable predictions about when this will happen.
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser of the Chinese government, argued that if all countries are mobilized to do the recommendations of the World Health Organization to counter the spread of the virus, the disease can end by June.
Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene Health and Medicine announced on March 17, that SARS-CoV-2 would probably be circulating for one or two years.
According to research conducted by Neil Ferrgueson in the Royal College, physical distancing and other measures will be essential when a vaccine is built (may be taken 18 months or more) before.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, \"I think it's less likely that the coronavirus is completely disappearing - because it's easily transmitted, and it's possible to become a seasonal disease that returns every year.\"
The severity of this return will depend on the collective and severity of its mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and people with symptoms may be asymptomatic.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms that are less common include fatigue, shortness of chest production, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle pain and joints, sore throat, headache, vomiting, increased blood, diarrhea, and cyanosis. The World Health Organization has said that, from about six people, one becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) published an emergency symptoms list: difficulty breathing, feeling pain or constant pressure in the chest, sudden discomfort, difficulty waking, dizziness of face and lips; if these symptoms occur, medical care is recommended immediately. More progress of this disease can lead to severe nausea, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and even death.
Some people with no symptoms may have no clinical symptoms, but the results of testing confirm the disease, so researchers have recommended that people with close contact with people should be carefully monitored and tested to avoid infection.
Estimates performed by one of the percentages of people who lack symptoms were significantly lower than 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the person until the onset of symptoms) is variable from one to 14 days; in the most common case, this period is five days.As an example of uncertainty, a fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% but later fell to 15%.
Some details about how the outbreak is spread are still being determined.
It is thought that the disease is mainly caused by close contact and by small particles produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking; and close communication means a distance between 1 and 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Research has shown that coughing without covering can spread small particles between 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some studies have suggested that the virus can be transmitted by small particles produced by speaking and staying in the air for longer periods of time. Although the virus is not generally airborne, respiratory particles can be produced by breathing, including talking.
These particles can be landed in the mouth or nose of the surrounding people or moved to their lungs through breathing.
Some medical procedures such as respiratory tuberculosis and pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can lead to respiratory secretions in the air as a result of the pandemic.
This disease is also transferred when a person touches a contaminated surface including the skin and then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are concerns about the possibility of transmission of the disease through the stool, it is thought to be low.
The Chinese government rejected the possibility of faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, although there is also the possibility of spillover before symptoms appeared and later stages of the disease, the most contagious virus is the emergence of symptoms in the first three days.
People whose test results have been positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, show that transmission of the disease is possible before developing significant symptoms.
Few reports of symptoms that have been approved by the laboratory, but transmission without symptoms has been identified by some countries during communications tracking investigation.
The European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) announced that while the rapid spread of the disease is not fully clear, a person can usually infect two or three other people. The virus is on different levels, from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to survive on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
However, these quantities can change depending on the humidity and temperature, so far some cases have been followed by positive testing of domestic animals and other animals for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to humans, however British authorities advise people to wash their hands after contact with animals, as with other surfaces where people may have touched them.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that covers its protective envelope.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have an animal origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the virus ribavirin from a variety of strains SARS, the genotype of SARS-CoV (lineage B) combined with two bat-derived genes.
The virus is consistent with 96 samples of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) at the general genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid in certain parts of their genome sequences between pangolins and humans.
A complete genome comparison to date has found that an estimated 92% of genetic material is shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts.
Infection by the virus can be detected temporarily by symptoms, however, a final confirmation is performed through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, while it is less specific as many CT imaging features overlapping with other inflammatory diseases and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used as a screening or an early test to diagnose COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, first published on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on respiratory and blood samples.
The results of this test are usually determined within a few hours to days.
This test is usually carried out with a luxurynex so it can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are working on serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these methods were accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by some reputable laboratories.
The characteristic features of imaging in radiography and computer metagraphy (CT) are those with symptoms, including graphs around the glossy and non-smoker.
The Italian Radiology Association is compiling an international online database of imaging findings of confirmed cases with the disease.
Nasophary imaging without confirmation by PCR is not commonly used due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that though imaging is less specifically used to diagnose the disease, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it would be used as a screening tool in all areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect imaging features of the virus both by radiography and by CT.
Some methods to prevent the transmission of the disease include proper personal hygiene, washing hands, touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue or putting the tissue directly into a waste container.
Those who are already infected with the disease are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent the transmission of the disease. Many governments have prohibited or recommended non-essential travel to countries or areas where the disease is common.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some people don’t know where or how they were infected. It is recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and use eye protection. Contact rejection is one of the important ways for health authorities to detect the source of infection, and to avoid further transmission.
The use of mobile location information by governments for this purpose has led to privacy concerns, and the Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations has issued a statement to limit this kind of surveillance.
Various apps for mobile phones have been developed or proposed to be used voluntarily, and by April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are trying to make solutions that are not a privacy breach, such as using Bluetooth to record the user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they're in close contact with a person with COVID-19.Misconceptions about how to prevent the disease are circulating; such as nose or ache with mouthwash are not effective.
Although many organizations are trying to develop a vaccine, there is still no vaccine for COVID-19.
To prevent the spread of disease, hand washing is recommended.
The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after toilets or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because the virus is killed outside the human body with household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.
CDC also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
The World Health Organization recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with their hands sitting.
Pollution of surfaces is possible in different ways (a minute exposure to disinfectants for stainless steel surface), including 71-62% ethanol, 100-50% ethanol, 0.1% hypochlorite sodium, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 7.5-0.2% beta.
Other methods, including benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 in a building such as a work office or day care facility, all sectors such as offices, health services, common areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch pages, keyboards, remote controls, and self-care devices used by patients, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing and disposing of tissue immediately.
For those who may be infected, surgical masks are recommended because wearing a mask can reduce the volume and distance of particles particles dispersed when talking, sneezing, or coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a psychologist at the University of Leeds, wearing masks can make people wish to touch their face, which is one of the most important sources of exposure, thus reducing the use of masks for those who are suspected of getting sick.
The World Health Organization recommends wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those taking care of people with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks helps people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have started to encourage people in the community to wear a face mask.
In the United States, the CDC recommends that non-medical masks made from cloth be used.China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially when close contact with other people (1 metres (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong has recommended the use of surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health officials encourage people to make masks at home using cloths and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have prohibited people from going out and attending the meetings without wearing a mask or covering one's mouth and nose.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Australian government mandated that they have a mask for those who visit food stores.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a face mask when attending the community.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-March, required passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama has mandated wearing a face mask when going out and recommends that those who cannot purchase a mask have their own homemade masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures intended to reduce the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
These practices include quarantines; travel restrictions; school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, and shopping centres.
Individuals stay home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds in crowded areas, greetings, and greetings without contact and physically distancing from others can perform these practices.
Currently, many governments in areas affected by the outbreak have mandated or recommended social distancing.
The maximum number of people recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 outbreaks in the area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people. Healthy people and those with underlying underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, blood pressure and immune system defects faced greater risk for severe complications and the CDC recommended that people stay home as much as possible in areas where the disease has spread. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term of physical distancing, to clearly show that the purpose of this work is to reduce physical contact and maintain social relations, both virtual and far away.
Using the term social distancing rather than encouraging individuals to maintain communication using alternative methods, it was desirable that people should be admitted to social isolation.Some authorities issued guidelines on sexual health, in order to use it during the pandemic.
These guidelines included recommendations that only have sex with someone you live with, who does not have the virus, or who does not have symptoms of the virus.
For those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected, a personal resurrection has been recommended at home.
Health agencies have issued minor instructions for proper self-quarantine.Many governments have mandated or recommended personal quarantines for all persons living in affected areas of the virus.
The strongest personal quarantine guidelines have been issued to those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with people who have COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region that has spread widely, have been advised to follow the self-quarantine for 14 days.
The strategies for control of an outbreak include control, suppression, and decline.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to eliminate and isolate people who are infected as well as introduce other measures to control the disease and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are transferred to the mitigation strategy: measures are taken to reduce the spread rate and reduce its effects on the healthcare system and society.
A combination of control and reduction measures can be implemented at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures in order to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number by less than 1.Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to reduce epidemic peaks known as flattening the entire curve.
This will reduce the risk of excessive pressure to health services and provide more time for vaccines and treatments to develop.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures including hand hygiene, wearing face masks, personal quarantines; social measures aimed at physical distancing, including school closures, and cancellation of events where there are large numbers of people; social engagement to encourage acceptance and compliance with these interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning up surfaces.When severity of the outbreak in China became clear, stricter measures were taken to prevent it, including quarantining all cities and implementing strict restrictions on the travel.
Other countries also implemented a series of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea deployed mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on people's movements.
Singapore imposed financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves, and imposed large fines for those who did not do so.
Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation strategy (slowing the spread and not stopping it) and suppression (reversing growth hormone) faced huge challenges.
Optimal policies can reduce the demand for health to 2/3 and the mortality rate to half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of people killed, and push too much pressure into the health system.
Repression can be a better strategy, but as long as the virus is in the human population (or until a vaccine is developed, it should be maintained sooner, because if it is taken away, the rate of spores will rapidly return to the previous extent.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no established antiviral medications approved for COVID-19, though efforts are underway to develop, including testing of existing medications.
The use of medications without the need for colds, drinking fluids and rest can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory aid devices may be required.
Using steroids can make conditions worse.
Several compounds already approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated to be repurposed as beneficial for treating COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also announced the synthesis of traditional and home remedies that can help alleviate the symptoms of SARS-CoV.
The WHO has described the increase in capacity and conformance to the needs of COVID-19 patients one of the critical measures to deal with the outbreak.
ECDC and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization has issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services to transfer resources to different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling non-essential surgical procedures if possible, separating and isolateing patients with COVID-19 and increasing intensive care capacity by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are different opinions about where the origin of the first case (e.g. zero patient) has been.
The first case of the novel coronavirus may trace back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of cases with coronavirus infections in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of these people were linked to the wholesale market of the Singapore Marine Food Market, which also sold live animals, and one of the ideas is that the origin of the virus was a species of these animals; that is, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A group of people with pneumonia were visited by unknown cause on 26 December, and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Hospital, who informed the subject of Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues of a coronavirus-like SARS-CoV infection.
The police recommended eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, to avoid spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Feen, was reprimanded by his superiors because of this warning.
Later, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on 31 December and informed the World Health Organization.
Many cases of pneumonia had been reported to Wuhan health authorities for unknown cause, and in early January the investigation was initiated.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of infected cases doubled, approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was transferred to other Chinese provinces, due to Wuhan being one of the transport hubs and major rail exchange centers.
On 20 January 2020, China reported around 140 new cases, including one in Beijing and one in Shenzhen within one day.
The following official data shows that 6,174 people had symptoms by 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States was overtaken by the highest number of confirmed cases in the world, China and Italy. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.31 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and 34,000 recovered.

On 27 February, due to increased concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock exchanges including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced their sharpest fall since 2008, the Dow Index fell to 1191 units, which was the highest fall rate in one day since the economic crisis 08-2007.
All three indexes ended the week with more than 10% reduction.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s supreme credit rating, but maintained its negative view.
Stock markets again fell due to the fear of the coronavirus and the largest fall on March 16.
Many consider economic recessions as likely.
Mohamed El-Erian praised the economic expert, emergency measures and timely central banks and governments.
Central banks, compared to the 2008 financial crisis, are reacting faster.
Due to travel bans, public health closures, including travel attractions and government recommendations, regardless of travel around the world, tourism is one of the most affected sectors.
As a result, numerous airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas have cancelled flights due to lower demand, and the regional airline Flybe was shut down in the UK.
The negative effects of the virus on the cruise ship industry have been unprecedented.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
This decision, with Chunyun, is one of the major travel season and related to Chinese Chinese holiday.
A number of events, including the New Year festivals in which a large population was cancelled by national or regional governments, and private companies including Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland, also independently shut down their shops and tourist attractions.
Many of the annual tourist events and attractions, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs, were shut down to prevent mass gatherings.
On 24 of 31 provinces, municipality and district of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February and ordered most workplaces not to reopen that date.
These regions formed 80% of GDP and 90% of the country’s exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year celebrations. Lowering the hours of temporary stores or closures caused the retail sector to be damaged around the world.
Visiting retail stores in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
North America and Middle East retail stores saw a drop of 60-50%.
The outbreak also resulted in a 333% reduction in walking traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
Participants of large malls around the world conducted other measures, including increased healthcare, installation of temperature scanners to check the temperature of shoppers and cancel events.According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, recessions caused by this pandemic could hit between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America with extreme poverty, which would not have been created without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people in Wuhan lost their jobs during the peak of the pandemic.
A large portion of the population of about 300 million rural migrant workers were trapped in domestic provinces in their homes or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank estimates, the coronavirus outbreak can damage 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate can increase by 32%.Series in India have been unemployed of tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who were paid daily). A survey conducted by Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some unemployment.In Spain since the closure of businesses and businesses in mid-March 2020, around 900,000 workers have lost their jobs.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers have asked for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million English workers have applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers to short-term work plans with government subsidies known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term compensation plan has also been implemented by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have also been profoundly affected by the pandemic, both operations and human forces of relevant organizations - whether it's working or independent - have been damaged around the world.
Active organisations in the field of culture and art have attempted to carry out their mission (which is often funded by government funding) in terms of providing community access to cultural heritage, maintaining the safety of employees and supporting artists if possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, performance halls, and other cultural institutions around the world and have been indefinitely closed down and their exhibitions, events, and performances have been cancelled or postponed.
Instead, there were a lot of efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. One of the other consequences of the disease that is recently accelerating is to cancel religious ceremonies, major events in sports and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion exhibitions.
The film industry has also experienced problems. The Vatican announced that holy week investigations in Rome, which are held during the last week of the fast season and the repentance of Christianity have been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended older Christians to stay at home rather than attending the Iin Asha Rasani Bay on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, live streaming or television, and others have provided the possibility of being present with car in Iin Abaidia.
Roman Catholic bishops shut down their churches and temples, and the St. Peter's Square was emptied from the Christian pilgrims, and other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and slums.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas of the disease and the Syrians were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned its arrival to foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to the sacred sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most disruption to the worldwide sporting calendar since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events, including the European Caucasus League, have been either cancelled or postponed by the 20-2019 Premier League, Euro 2020, NBA season 20-2019 and the season of NHL 20-2019.
The outbreak hit the 2020 Summer Olympics scheduled to begin in July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be planned for a historic period of more than 2020, maximum for summer 2021, and other gaming centers around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have been either cancelled or postponed.
This has led many gamblers to bring online sites, with many gambling sites reporting significant increases in their registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been damaged, with many music groups suspending or cancelling concert shows.
Many major theatres, including Broadway, have also suspended all performances.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue to produce and share art through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, including live streaming concerts or create web-based technologies for artists to perform, distribute, and publicize their works.
In online spaces, many Internet memes have been spread to the coronavirus content so that many of them are among the unreliable, indisputable, inclusive issues.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, increasing discrimination, xenophobia, and racism have been noted toward people of Chinese and East Asian origin, as well as people who are in cases of illness in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia-Pacific region, there have been incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility.
Reports from February (when most of the cases were still limited to China) indicate the emergence of racist sentiments in different groups around the world about whether people deserve the virus or experience wave punishment.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional location.
Supporting Chinese people online and offline has been made from those located in affected areas of the virus.
After the disease spread to other countries, people of Italy, the first European country to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19 was also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia.Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions in order to stop the spread of disease.
In Japan, ChineseDontComeToJapan's hashtag grew on Twitter.
Chinese nationals as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increasing levels of racist tweets and attacks against themselves.
The U.S. president Donald Trump was criticized for naming coronavirus as a Chinese coronavirus, the term was racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreigners who had been evacuated from Wuhan and had moved to Noi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from Northeast India who share a border with China and are studying in major Indian cities experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, head of the State Department of the British Party of Janata in West Bengal, announced that the Chinese had destroyed nature, and that, for this reason, God took revenge on them.
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it Nadrinki.In China, the pandemic flamed the xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, and foreigners called external an evacuation and targeted them to leave China.
Many newspapers with payroll have removed the share cost for all or part of the coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available freely.
Some scientists quickly shared their results on pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

Testing for the respiratory disease of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and disease generated in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus' RNA.
This test is dedicated, and it only detects the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
This test is used to confirm very new or active infections.
The diagnosis of antibodies (serology) is also useful for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Pedton's test shows how many people have been infected with the condition with the diagnosis of very mild symptoms and did not report or had symptoms.
Using the results of this test, the exact rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population is recognizable.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no countries have reliable data on the prevalence of the disease in their population.
By 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there are many differences in the number of tests conducted between countries.
This difference is likely to significantly affect the case fatality rate, which has been estimated to be over-estimated in some countries.
The test, which uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), can be done on respiratory samples taken in different ways, including ambulatory swab or sputum sample.
The results of this test are usually specified within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with throat swabs only provides reliable results in the first week of illness.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, while it is expanding in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternative specimens can be taken from the respiratory tract by suction catheter, or there may be an option to use the material produced by coughing (sputum) as well.
One of the first PCR tests was invented in Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of 250,000 test kits that were distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test method by 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical trial of SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) based on PCR.
The series follows the Chinese gene shared in all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene, which belongs to SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Control (CDC) is distributing RT-PCR's new coronavirus (2019-CoV) detection panel between public health labs through International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in previous versions of the test due to defective and test limitations in the CDC in Atlanta led to non-determination results; this led to processing at an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully.
By February 28, 2020, the test was not recognized using two components, and after that, state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization.US commercial labs began to do the test in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced that COVID-19 testing was available across the country, based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics similarly made nationwide COVID-19 testing available as of 9 March 2020.
No limitations were announced for the number of tests; receiving and processing of specimens should be performed according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the development and development of a COVID-19 test was conducted by the National Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service Center for Health and Treatment.On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic reported that Mayo had created a test for COVID-19 disease.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in high volume, allowing a device to do approximately 4,128 tests within a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for the m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received EUA licenses for a test that takes 45 minutes from the FDA.
The FDA has approved a test that uses nucleic acid amplification instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results only within five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the U.S. and Abbott expects to deliver 50,000 tests by increasing production. A test that uses a monoclonal powder that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan and hopes to provide results within 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid flu test.
According to research conducted in March 2020, radiographics from the chest have little diagnostic value in early stages, while CT findings can be identified even before symptoms emerge.
Typical features in CT include multi-lobar multi-lobe glass curricula with side distribution, non-reactive and deformity.
With the progression of the disease, the seizure, the gastrointestinal coating, and the stiffness occurs.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, which is the current pandemic, has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, while it is less specific as many of the features of CT imaging with other inflammatory diseases and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used as a screening or an early test for COVID-19 infection, as of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune system response to this infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after 7 days or more of the emergence of symptoms, diagnosis of immunity, and population surveillance. The test is performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through testing in the patient's Berlin (PoCT).
High-capacity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the rate of production of each system.
For CLT, a sample of peripheral blood is usually used, although there is a possibility of using multiple pyrotypes to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, a sample of blood is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, it did not require the extraction phase prior to testing.On March 26, 2020, the FDA released a list of 29 entities, which were informed to the organization as they were asked, so they were now able to distribute their own testosterone tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmuun and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits. These kits could detect IgG and IgA antibodies that were infected against the virus and were present in the blood sample.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours and therefore much faster than the PCR assay of viral RNA.
These pads are usually 14 days after the onset of the disease. In early April, the UK found that none of the Pedton test kits it purchased are adequately used.
Hong Kong implemented a plan in which suspected patients can stay home, the emergency emergency department will give the patient a specimen tube, the patient will pour the mouth in and then receive a test result for a while. NHS UK has announced that it is implementing a plan to test suspected cases at home that will eliminate the risk of being infected if others are to go to the hospital and if they need to disinfect it. In those centers where the possibility of entering a vehicle to test suspected cases with COVID-19, a healthcare professional will take appropriate precautions.
In Germany, the National Association of Occupational Health Insurance Physicians announced on 2 March that it had a capacity of 12,000 tests per day, and that, in the weeks prior, 10,700 people were tested.
If the test order is given by a doctor, its costs are paid by health insurance.
According to the president of Robert Creek, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it is possible to test cars in several large cities.
By 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was not clear because only positive results were reported.
A laboratory questionnaire showed that as of 12 January 2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested until the end of the week of 12 January 2020 and the result was 33,491 samples (6.9%) positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion and Ramam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing 64 patients simultaneously, they did this by combining samples and then performing further tests only if the outcome of a positive sample was tested. In Wuhan, 5 February 2020, a temporary emergency detection laboratory called a 2000 square meters (Chinese: Öcalan-Yan), or a fire source opened by BGI, which has the ability to process 10,000 samples per day.
The development of the laboratory took five days and monitoring its construction by BGI Institute, Wang Jian, demonstrated that if the test capacity was not implemented, the number of cases in Wuhan would have doubled 47%, and the corresponding cost of the quarantine would have been doubled.
Similar specimens from Wuhan labs, as Huo-Yan labs, were immediately set up in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily capacity of 50,000 tests per day. Open and composite text designs released by Origami trials can test 1,122 patient samples using only 93-bit COVID-19 testing. These balanced designs are applicable in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquids testing.
By March, shortages and lack of pesticides had become a barrier to mass testing in Europe, the UK and the United States.
This has led some authors to examine the sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples up to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for more testing. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now testing a large number of its country population for coronavirus, which is more successful than any other country, and is therefore successful to obtain a major part of its country's population.
This has been possible due to the capability of testing with cars and purchasing a large laboratory on the scale of the entire population of the country from the 42 and BGI (based on China’s emergency detection laboratories.
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to operate outside of China.
Different testing recipes targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization used German guidelines to provide and send China to low-income countries that do not have the resources to produce internal subsidies.
The German test kits were published on January 17, 2020. Since the protocol was not available by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control of U.S. to 28 January, delaying tests in the U.S. and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and those countries with Australia couldn't provide enough kits to respond to the demand and cases recommended by health experts for testing.
In contrast, experts say South Korea's broad availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capacity, mainly in private sector labs, has been built over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for ramping up the testing programmes as the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.High demand for testing due to wide spread of the virus caused backlogs of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents became scarce.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in its experimental kits.
In the United States, the test kits produced by the CDC had the vaccine. The government then removed bureaucratic barriers from performing private experiments. Spain purchased test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that testing results were not correct.
The company explained that the incorrect results may be a problem in collecting samples or using the kits incorrectly.
Spain's minister said it won't use cases that offer incorrect results and replaces them with a different test kit developed by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China gave wrong results.Slovaki bought 1.2 million test kits from China that made the results wrong.
Prime Minister Mattovich suggested that the series would be dumped into the Danube River. At first, Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test kits Turkey purchased from China had a high error value and did not make them use of the British government purchased 3.5 million miles of testing from China, but in early April 2020 announced they were not usable.
Testing and followed by testing of people who tested positive for the virus and tracing of those with whom the SARS-CoV-2 positive positive outcome had tested positive.
Researchers working in the city of Vò, Italy, where the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on the entire population of about 3,400 people a day.
About half the people testing positive had no symptoms, and all positive cases were quarantined.
By limiting travel to public centers, new infections completely disappeared.
With aggressive contact tracing, there were limits, testing, and quarantining passengers from entry, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore had been much more severe than other developed countries, though without extreme restrictions like forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has recommended the Savannah to stay at home on 28 March, but schools were reopened on 23 March and on their appointed time.
Several other countries, including Iceland and South Korea, also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, testing, and quarantines.
A statistical study has shown that countries who have tested more than deaths have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries with limited testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative COVID-19 testing samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to confirm it.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the positive column is more than the total test parameters of each country's testing policy.
If all other conditions are similar, it will be more positive than all the Chinese tests in a country that only tests people who are admitted to hospitals than in a country that tests all citizens whether or not they have symptoms.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning a person’s hand to eliminate soil, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Hand washing with soap consistently at the critical moment during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and cholera, which is transmitted through feces.
For example, if people do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes), they may be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or cold.
Five important positions during the day when washing hands with soap are: before and after going to the bathroom, after cleaning a child or changing his clothes, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands in the following cases:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the patient.
After changing the garment or cleaning the child after using the toilet.
After blowing, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal waste or food to animals.
Medical hand hygiene refers to health measures related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before taking medicine or medical care can prevent the disease or minimize its transmission.
The primary purpose of hand washing in medical sense is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause risk or illness.
This is especially important for people who work with food or work in medical-related jobs, but also important for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; decreasing respiratory infections;
and reducing infant mortality rate at home during birth.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing practices may lead to small improvements in the growth of children under five years old.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by promoting simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate caused by these diseases by approximately 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea cases by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low income areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with hand washing with soap.Hand washing with soap is an automatic treatment that has become habitable in homes, schools, and communities around the world only, the most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Inhalation, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is one of the causes of death and death of children under the age of 5, causing about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and nausea together cause approximately 3.5 million children to die annually.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using a toilet into a solid habit can save more people's lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, causing death from diarrhea to almost half, and reducing a quarter of deaths caused by acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other health interventions as part of water, sanitation and cleaning programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against an infection that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
One of the harmful but small effects of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin drying and thus damage to the skin.
A study in Denmark in 2012 found that excessive hand washing can lead to skin irritation, which also serves as an eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Too frequent and frequent hand washing is also referred to as one of the symptoms of erectile dysfunction (OCD).
Five important times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease: after going to the bathroom (arid, stool), after cleaning a child (feature of clothes), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling meat, fish, or raw chicken.
Other items in that proper hand washing methods should be taken to prevent transmission of disease include before and after treating a sore or wound, after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or touching animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is low.
In 2015, a study on hand washing in 54 countries found that on average, 38.7% of households were washing hands with soap. A study in 2014 found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing with soap, 97 percent; the United States is in the middle with 77 percent; China is in the lowest grade 23 percent. There are now several ways to change the behaviour of washing hands with soap at the critical time.Hand washing is important for children in school hours prior to developing hand washing habits to teaching children.
The basic health care program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of extensive measures to promote health and education in children.
Two times a year with washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride is the main focus of this national program.
In Indonesia, the program has been successfully implemented.
Adding a soap or detergent to water is effective in removing microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce solvent barriers and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient cleanser for the skin because fats and proteins that are unique to organic soil are not easily dissolved in water.
However, the flow of enough water helps in cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its re-use nature, may hold bacteria that are from the previous shell.
A small number of studies that have been given to transfer bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that bacterial transmission seems unlikely because bacteria are washed with foam.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention is still believed to be a fluid biomarker that can be accessed without direct contact.
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to people who care about health.
To date, there is no evidence that effective anti-inflammatory or gludesda is in the removal of antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial substances such as trichloros, which are a wide variety of organisms resistant to it.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant species were not to be eliminated by antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as they are advertised in the market.
Advanced formulations, in addition to surfactant and skin protective matter, may contain acid (acetic acid, sinteric acid, lactose acid) as pH regulator, anti-microbial acid, and other skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamin, minerals, plant extract). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon's public health faculty showed that regular soap is as effective as anti-bacterial soap containing triclosan in preventing disease and removing hand bacteria.
Hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap in removing natural oils that contain soil and bacteria.
However, in contrast to public opinion, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on the hands.
Anti-Aging agent is a non-water-hygienic substance.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs or hand sanitizers) have enjoyed popularity.
Most of these are made from alcohol or ethanol with a thickening substance such as carbomer (a acrylic acid polymer) and gel, or for ease in the use and reducing the drying effect of alcohol from a competitors such as glycerine and are made in the form of liquid or foam.
Adding diluted hydroxide hydrogen increases further anti-microbial activity. Anti-inflammatorys containing at least 60 to 95% of alcohol are effective germ killers.
Alcohol-free anti-inflammatorys cause bacteria to disappear, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, fever, RSV, rhinovirus, cow-free, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol, 30 seconds after use, caused a loss of 99.97% (about 3.5 lbs equivalent to 35 decibels) of hand bacteria and 1 minute after use, causing 99.99% to 99.99% (either 4 to 5 lbs) of hand bacteria.Hand sanitizers are effective against bacteria, but are less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against other viruses (or Norwalk) that are the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal disease.Enough hand antiseptic or alcohol-containing gel should be used to both hands fully digested or covered.
The back and front of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers should be taxed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
Finger tips should also be washed well by rubbing them into both hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing over hand sanitizer use, especially when hands are completely dirty.
The increasing use of these substances is because of their ease of use and their ability to quickly eliminate microorganisms; however, they should not be used as an alternative to proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless softers or skin moisturizers are added to their formulations.
Adding glycic acid or other lubricants to their formula can reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
In clinical trials, hand sanitizers containing alcohol and disinfectants caused much less skin irritation than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, a syndrome that occurs without contact or sensitivity to alcohol or additives found in alcohol-based hand sanitizers rarely occur.
The lower likelihood of developing contact dermatitis as compared to washing hands with water and soap has made them attractive.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water-based materials do not clean hands from organic materials, but also disinfect them.
This is because hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many diseases, as the pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effect of alcohol-free hand-free hand sanitizers is strongly dependent on the ingredients and their formulations, and historically has little effect on alcohol-containing alcohol.
It has recently been shown that formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have a more cumulative and continuous anti-microbial activity, unlike alcohol, which is likely to decrease because of negative skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and instead use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but may have less impact than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is infected to microorganisms, it may increase its spread rather than slowing the spread of disease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent because it forms in contact with alkali-soluble water.
If soap is not available, the World Health Organization recommends ashes or sand as alternative to soap.
The proper hand washing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
The current water is recommended to be contaminated because the water on the ground may be contaminated. This is while the temperature of the water does not seem to cause any changes.
Wash your hands up and wipe me out, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when they only use water.
Put your hands on me for at least 20 seconds.
Maling hands has created friction and helps remove germs from the skin, and scrubbing hands for longer periods removes more germs.
Wash your hands with good water.
Washing in water can recontaminate the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and tight hands can easily be contaminated. The most part of the hand sitting are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under fingernails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish may be hidden from microorganisms.
Moisturizing cream is often recommended to prevent the drying of the hands. Skin dryness leads to skin damage and can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are a variety of low cost options for facilitating hand washing in developing countries where water or soap is not available. For example, the pouring of water from a gallon or a hanging hole or if necessary to use ash. In situations where water resources are limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water consumption, such as glass tapes or small water taps and other low cost options.
The Tip button is a simple technology that is made of a container hanging by a rope and a controlable lever by the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a glass of soap.
Effective drying of the hands is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there are some debates about the most effective form of drying in public washrooms.
A growing volume of research suggests that paper towels are much more healthcare than electric dryers that exist in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was held with the support of the paper whale industry, the European Manuscript Symposium was held by the University of Westminster in London to compare the health rate of paper towels, hot air dryer machines and more modern air-conditioning machines.
After washing and drying hands with a warm-air dryer, the total number of bacteria in the fingers was increased by 194% to 194% and the foam bacteria of the hands by 254%.
Drying the hands with the jet-air dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria in the finger tip by 42% and on the palms of the hands by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average on the finger tip of 76% and on the palms of the hands 77%.The researchers also carried out tests to determine whether there is a possibility of cross contamination of other hand-washing and washing environments using different hand drying methods.
The air jet dryer device, which, according to claims, takes out the air at speeds of 180 meters per second (650 km or 400 miles per hour), is capable of blowing micro-organisms from hands and devices and potentially infecting other people who use a handwashing environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a warm-air dryer, it can scatter micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Paper towels did not cause significant release of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes in some bacteria were observed after drying the hands:
There are a large number of hand dryer manufacturers, and hand driers compared with drying with paper towels.
If soap and water are not available during travel, hand washing using hand sanitizing wipes can be used as an alternative.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should have at least 60% alcohol.
Shortly after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis diagnosed the effectiveness of hand washing (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital environment, hand washing was mandatory.
There are electronic devices that can remind if hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that the infection levels were reduced using them.
The time required for hand washing is at least 15 seconds, using sufficient amounts of soap and water or gel and brushing all parts of the hand.
The hands should be rubbed and the fingers should fall together.
If there is a hook under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important that the hands are well absorbed and dried up with a clean towel.
After drying the hand, paper towels should be used to close water milk (and if necessary to open the door).
This prevents re-contaminating the hands from contacting those surfaces.
The purpose of washing hands in health centers is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (hyperceptives and prevent them from transmitting them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that lack of hand-washing is at an unacceptable level in most hospital environments, so many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could help up to 66 percent of the amount of blood flow infections that the catheter plays.The World Health Organization has published a leaf-free diet that reflects the standard way to wash hands and to wash hands together in health care sectors.
The hand hygiene guide written by the organization is also available on its website for the public.
A related review was conducted by Whitby and colleagues.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if necessary.
The World Health Organization has set five times before to wash the hands:
after exposure to blood/body fluids
before performing an aseptic task, and
After patient care.The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (Chinese hand rubs or microbial soaps) is reinforced by the adjunctive agent of hand washing.
Such measures may be taken before surgery or in an environment where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent.To wash the hands before surgery is required: Water milk that can be opened and closed without direct contact, the amount of chlorhexidine or edema, sterile towels for drying hands after washing them and brushing their own washing and other sterile equipment to clean the nails.
All jewelry should be brought out.
In this way, you need to wash your hands and forearms to elbow for usually 2-6 minutes.
Long wash (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When water is poured, it will prevent water from returning to the hands of the man.
After hand-washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth, and the surgical garment is covered.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash the hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after taking care of the patient.
For control of staphylococchicus infections in hospitals, it has been found that the most beneficial use of hand cleansing comes from the first 20% of washing, and when cleaning the hands is increased by more than 35%, there is very little additional benefits.
Washing with regular soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food as compared to antibacterial soap.Hand washing with hand-based solution with hand-based hand washing with soap for 30 seconds showed that washing with hand-washing and hand-rubbing was associated with anti-bacterial soap was associated with 26% soap.
But using soap and water against hand washing with alcohol-based substances is more effective than reducing H1N1 influenza virus and Daphyl chloride from hands.The measures necessary to improve hand hygiene in health centers can include training staff to wash hands, increasing access to alcohol-based detergents, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these measures is more effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is remembered as a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health and even proper nutrition.
However, lack of reliable water, soap or hand washing facilities in bats, schools, and workplaces challenge achieving the necessary behaviors for washing hands globally.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, water taps are scarce to wash hands near personal or public toilets, although there are cheaper options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates rather than due to lack of soap or water, can be the result of our bad habits.
The promotion of hand washing with soap can affect selection policies, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term behavior change in society.
Monitoring and evaluation are necessary to ensure that this is effective.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing hand washing rates in low- and middle-income countries, while social advertising campaigns are less effective. One example is to promote hand washing in schools, three-star navigation is by UNICEF that encourages schools to ensure that students wash their hands with soap by taking simple and inexpensive steps to meet other health requirements.
By setting up the minimum standards, schools can eventually upgrade from one star to three stars.
Building hand washing stations can be part of the promotion to wash hands, which is done to reduce disease and die in children.
Global Hand washing Day is another example of oral awareness programmes targeting changes in people's behaviors.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of handwashing emojis.
A small number of studies, in general, rejected the more cost-effective hand washing in developing countries in terms of the number of years lost due to disability.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other measures.
For the first time, the importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people who are in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in the hospital – was determined by two women from the hospital in the middle of the 19th century: Hungarian physician, Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, and English Florence Nightingale, who was the founder of modern nursing.
At that time, most people believed that infections were caused by an unpleasant smell called Measma.
In the 1980s, an outbreak of food-related infections and health-care-related infections caused the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to further promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from infectious diseases.
For example, posters with proper hand washing practices were installed alongside hand washing sinks in public toilets and office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase ‘washing someone’s hands of something means declaring the lack of a person’s unwillingness to accept responsibility for a subject or share in it.
The term is derived from the Holy Bible, where Pontius Pilate has taken the decision to crucify Christ, but it is now used in some English communities with a much wider application.
In Macbeth Shakespeare, Ms. McBeth, trying to clean up an oily stain, he is forced to wash his hands, representing his guilty conscience against the crimes he committed and encouraged his wife to do.
It has also been found that people who tend to wash their hands more after having recalled or understood the unethical actions, tending to wash their hands more often than others.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such an adjustment are less likely to participate in other pre-cleaning actions such as voluntary work.
Foods recommend hand washing for health purposes and symbols.Submitting hand washing and using water and non-water to wash hands is a part of hand washing rituals that are featured in many religions, including Bahite, Hinduism, Tulipt and Neptune Memory in Judaism, a pool of water in Christianity and in Islam.Intervention also recommends hand washing after certain activities.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate washing of hands after using toilets.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam recommend washing hands before and after every meal.
Control of hazard controls to COVID-19 in the workplace.
Hazard controls related to COVID-19 in the workplace mean using safe medical procedures to control the risks associated with the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper hazard controls in the workplace depend on the workplace and the type of employment, and should be conducted based on a risk assessment of sources, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for workers who may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that are less at risk have fewer job contact with ordinary people and other coworkers, and for them are essential measures to prevent infection from including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are ill, maintaining daily respiratory hygiene and disinfecting of the work environment.
Persons on average may include jobs where employees need frequent or close contact with people who are not diagnosed with COVID-19 but may be infected due to ongoing spread of the virus in the community or because of international travel.
This includes those who have contact with the general public, such as in schools, high-population-density work environments, and in some retails with high-volume retailers.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation through high-explosive air filters, sneeze guards, and having personal protective equipment available in case a person with COVID-19 is encountered.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recognizes healthcare workers exposed to people who are infected with COVID-19, including those who are at high risk of being at high risk.If employees do what they can to produce aerosol-generating procedures in the air, or collect or handle specimens of people with COVID-19 infection, they are at high risk.
The appropriate way to control the risk for these persons includes engineering controls such as creating negative pressure ventilation rooms and using personal protection equipment fits the job task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects within the workplace.
Employees may not be present due to being ill, need to take care of others or fear of possible exposure.
Business patterns may change, both in terms of what calories are needed, and in terms of the way of achieving these goods (such as shopping at non-stop hours or shopping through delivery services at home or shopping with cars).
Lastly, shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be stopped.Anesthesia and apps that can be used to guide protective measures.
These programs examine the risk associated with various workplaces and job tasks, including sources of exposure to the disease, risk factors caused by the home and community and risk factors for employees such as age or chronic diseases.
It also explains necessary control measures to address those risks as well as potential plans to address situations that might result in the outbreak.
Preservatives and plans that are prepared to respond to infectious diseases may be subject to national or local recommendations.
The goals of response to the outbreak include reducing the transmission of disease between employees, protecting people who are more susceptible to health side effects, maintaining business activities, and minimizing negative effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in areas where commercial activities occur affects the decisions taken.
The risk control hierarchy includes a framework that is widely used in occupational safety and health, in which it can handle hazards in proportion to their effectiveness.
Where COVID-19 hazards cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and lastly personal protective equipment.
The engineering control method requires keeping employees away from work risks without relying on the behavior of employees and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
The following control methods include changes in policy or work method performed by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less efficient than engineering and administrative controls, but can prevent the virus from being exposed to some extent.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risk for employees, properly installed (e.g., breathing device), consistently and properly covered, regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, properly removed, cleaned, and removed to avoid contamination properly.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that are less at risk have fewer job contact with ordinary people and other coworkers.
Basic measures recommended to prevent infection in all workplaces include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, lowering their respiratory tract including covering the mouth and nose and sneezing, providing paper towels and waste bucket, preparing for the work of remotely working, or in intensive tissues if needed, encouraging employees not to use the tools and equipment others and to clean up and maintain regular work environment.
Prompt identification and separation of people who are potentially infected is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and other people at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until they can be aware of these policies without the use of a fever reduction or other changes of symptoms, from fever, fever symptoms, and other symptoms.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that are at a high level of risk include jobs where employees need frequent or close contact with those younger than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not diagnosed with COVID-19 but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing spread in the community or because of international travel in areas where COVID-19 is widely distributed.
This includes employees who are in contact with the general public such as schools, workplaces with large population density and some crowded retailers. The engineering control method for these and higher risk groups can include installation of high-power air filters, increasing the rate of traffic, installing physical barriers such as plastic protective equipment and installing vehicle services to customers. Administrative controls for these and groups include: encouraging patient workers to stay at home, replace meetings with virtual communications, creating non-essential travel to places where they are exposed to COVID-19 outbreaks, including emergency communications to informing employees of the need for safety of persons and staff who need to wear appropriate personal protective equipment, to protect and maintain a face-to-face face-to-to-to-face face-to-to-face face-to-to-face face-to-to-face safety care, to protect and maintain safety of the work environment, and maintain safety of employees who may need to protect or maintain regular work-care care, and maintain a person-care face-to-to-to-care care, including personal-to-to-care care, to protect their hands-to-care care, and maintain safety and maintain a person’s face-to-to-to-care needs in the face-to-to-to-care environment, and maintain safety of workers’s face-to-to-to-to-to-to-care needs, and maintain safety needs in the face-care care, and maintain safety needs of workers’s face-care environment, and maintain safety of the needs of workers’s face-to-care care, and maintain safety of workers’s face-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-care care, including in the needs of workers’s face-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-care needs of the needs of workers.
Employees who are at risk in this group rarely need to use the respiratory tract.
If a person becomes sick within an airplane, proper procedures to protect workers and other passengers may include separating the sick person from others by 6 feet, separating only one crew for the sick person and offering a face mask to the sick person, or applying the patient to cover his mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should use disposable medical gloves when taking care of the sick traveler or when contacting the body fluids or contaminated surfaces, and if the patient has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, they should use more personal protection equipment.
Gloves and other disposable items should be injected into the biosafety bag, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, controlling hazards include delays of travel when the disease is, personal quarantines, or other symptoms when traveling.
In an ideal case, medical follow-up should be conducted in the quarantine cabinet. For schools and childcare facilities, if an infected person has been enrolled in a school building regardless of the outbreak in the community, the CDC recommends the closure for a short period of time to clean or disinfect.
If there is minimal or moderate transmission in society, measures can be implemented on the basis of social distancing: cancelling scientific circulation, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes or car or eating food in the cafeteria, increasing the distance between desks, separating people from time to time, limiting non-essential visitors and using separate health facilities for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant risk of community transmission, in addition to social distancing methods, long-term closure of schools should be considered. For law enforcement personnel who do their daily activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lowers their immediate health risk.
To law enforcement officials who need to be in contact with people who have COVID-19, it is recommended to follow guidelines that follow emergency medical technicians, including the use of proper personal protective equipment.
If close contact when people are arrested, employees should clean and disinfect their belt and equipment before re-useing a household cleaning spray or wipe, and at the same time follow standard procedures for the use and disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE) and washing clothes.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) knows health care workers, including those who are at high risk.
Occupations at high-risk levels include staff of healthcare, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who have been exposed to people with known or suspected COVID-19.
Workers who work may create airborne particles or collect or handle specimens from people with COVID-19 who are at high risk.
The tasks that lead to the production of airborne particles include tubes, cough induction, bronchoscopic and some operations and dental examinations or invasive specimens from the patient.
Workloads that are at high risk include workers who are preparing for a person who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 when they die or suspected.In case a broken skull, the risk level increases. Additional engineering controls for this group include creating separate rooms for patients with or suspected COVID-19, including when doing things that lead to airborne particles produced.
Negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate for some health and treatment centers.
Patients should be treated with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that if newly introduced patients with COVID-19, they will be kept in a distinct and separate waiting room.In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommends the use of respiratory tract for those who work within 6 feet of patients with suspected or suspected COVID-19 and also for those who do things that will lead to aerosol-generating procedures in the air.
In the United States, the N95 respiratory filtering machine approved by NIOSH and is used according to the use of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes appropriate testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can be more protected and easier to use for employees.The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of whole body coverings because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through bodily fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only use of surgical masks for screening people at entry points.
The World Health Organization recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses, or face shielding patients from COVID-19 who do not and doing any work that would lead to aerosol-generating procedures in the air, recommending the use of surgical masks, or face shielding, Gandolin and gloves.
If a surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respiratory tract, a surgical mask can be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that global supply of personal protective equipment is not enough, the World Health Organization recommends the following cases to minimize the need for personal protective equipment: non-essential medical examinations, creating physical barriers such as installing transparent windows, allowing only those involved in hospital care for COVID-19 patients, using personal protective equipment only to perform specific tasks, using a respiratory mask when taking care of multiple patients who all have a disease, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment and not using masks for people who do not have symptoms.

This month we see ourselves in remarkable circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that clearly clears our global interconnection of humans and our responsibilities to one another.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we know that our best response depends on empathy, cooperation, and society that is at the heart of this organization.
The companion and level of care that we have seen among our colleagues through email, call and chat is a sign of incredible humans that we have the chance and honor of working alongside them.
I am very grateful and proud to have you all as a partner.
Last week, someone appreciated what we do.
They reminded me of how magnificent it is that the world can now visit Wikipedia and what a powerful sign that this important source can be online and accessible to all.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep sites updated or our colleagues earn money or our communities are safe.
The world now needs information that Wikipedia offers more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do but also the way we work will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will apply significant modifications from the beginning of the next week in how we do our shared work.
Adjustments to our work and programs
As Robyn mentioned previously, the team-c last night met to discuss our approach and plan for the coming days and months.
During that conversation, we made a decision that we thought was the right answer to what we are facing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this time.
We wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce, that’s okay.
To all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Until further notice, we expect 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week to work.
We don’t announce a holiday – if you can work more normal hours, you’ll be in pain with this mission.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and it doesn’t matter if you care about your loved ones, buy food, or go to your doctor, your health is our priority.
We don’t track your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
This should go without saying, but we say that.
You don’t need to get a emergency leave or a personal leave – just tell your manager and help your group to review calendars and programs and make sure that someone has covered key work.
(If you have tested positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan know of the T&C section so that T&C can help you and make sure your situation is managed properly).
Employees who work for an hour are fully paid.
As we have already said, we adhere to our commitments to contractors and colleagues who work at an hour.
All wages are paid according to the usual hours of work in normal circumstances.
This includes you even if you’re sick and you’re not able to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to drain their stress into the world around us.
What we do, especially in such situations, can be very valuable.
Again, this is about your self-care.
Our desire is to communicate with your manager to know what to expect and to plan accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are things we need to do.
SRE teams, HR Ops, trust and security and attract capital (and others) do critical and important things that may need more support.
We will start a process with other departments to assess current objectives and limit our focus toward supporting the essentials for our mission.
For all of us there is a lot of work, all of us will focus on the most basic projects.
If we do the process right now, we will not be hurt later.
We do not have a plan to work twice as much as we can to finish the pandemic and to handle tasks.
You don’t expect to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are currently impossible.
We accept that conditions have changed and will work to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
How is APP (Annual Planning)?
To match the new reality and expectations of the daily working hour, we intend to adjust our 2021-2020 program timeline.
Our goal is to propose the extension of the 2020-2019 program that gives us more time to budget and allows employees to prioritize critical work, self-care, and care for loved ones, while allowing those who need or wish to work less hours over the next few weeks.
This extension greatly reduces the amount of current workloads throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and will inform delegates and teams in the next steps as soon as possible.
Thank you for your annual planning team for leadership this.
Office status, exposure to disease and cleaning
Last week, we found that one of the SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, for more caution, we employed an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used an anti-virus solution of a hospital to disinfect all surfaces, as well as for the lobby and elevator that is on our floor.
The building uses its own care protocol and uses products that are useful for the health of its residents.
We are confident that when we decide to go back, the office will be well prepared.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shares its COVID-19 protocol with us and all the employees based on DBC.
According to the San Francisco State directive, our Washington DC office has become a completely remote set since last week.
As some of our based colleagues know in New York, we have also talked about renting a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions will continue, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Older colleagues who work with us remotely know that this can be adaptive and want to recommend you:
Limit the length of meetings to at most one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, check how they can be held within a few days.
Explain the meeting clearly, have a job order and send the required materials for the study before.
Set the video with tools like Google Docs and Zoom so you can facilitate live collaboration and connection.
Set someone responsible for the session leadership, someone responsible for monitoring chats to follow the questions and list of speakers and someone to note (or share notes).
If you need a comfortable target, send email technical support group.
Use your health allowance for the promise.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The Human Resource Operations Team is seeking guidance from the state-based ergonomics to support the increased work divided across the Foundation.
Last week we asked all of the financial points on the basis of the foundation, such as editathon, to cancel public events that are held on budgets and Wikipedia, until the World Health Organization declared the pandemic to be over.
We inform them that we know that our request to cancel programs and other restrictions can make it impossible to do agreed activities related to obtain financial privileges and that no one is punished for delays or modifying their goals.
The next week we will provide more instructions about Wikimania and other topic and regional social integrations.
It seems that public feeling throughout the global community is also uncomfortable because of these disorders and while feeling embarrassed because of their transparency and ability to focus on the activities of their communities, Wikimedia and so on.
As we go ahead, the CRT is trying to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for society to monitor the impact of the entry and keep our communications with them.
Connecting with COVID-19 matters
For the next Thursday, we will send a meeting invitation for special staff to your calendars at 14:00 UTC with 07:00 time PT.
We use this time and give you more and more information, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are all together in this together and we are here to help you through any possible way.
Meanwhile, you can find relevant information via this email and other COVID-19 related information on Office Wiki.
The CRT has updated these pages and keeps all the information in one place.
We also strive to communicate regularly with those of our employees who live in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, main work flow or news coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, please don’t hesitate to inform and cooperate with the CRT.
We are here to help and support you if necessary.
If you want to talk about a confidential or sensitive topic, please email Bryan Judan - Director of International Human Resources Operations.
None of these changes should be considered as the abandonment of our work and obligations.
Rather, it indicates that at this moment our work and obligations are likely to need to adapt to the way we don’t have in the past.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work and support our movement and provide services that the world has to offer.
What we’ve planned will be the time when the Fara is coming, we will be waiting for it.
It’s time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks and potentially months ahead.
We all need you to realize this, so we want you to be your care and your families so that you can be in your best condition when you need it.
Now, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Kathryn, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jameme V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the external surface (cell membrane) of lung cells, red blood cells, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE2 disrupts the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease.ACE2 also serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of this enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-promoting enzyme 2 contains a type of magnesium that sits on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains a N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain surrounding the level of cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from transmembrane domains, and the soluble protein is eventually excreted into urine after entering the blood stream.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 refers to the cellular membrane of cells of a type II membrane, mainly ribocytes, small intestines, endothelial and venous endothelial cells, and thick muscle cells, most organs.
ACE2 mRNA symptoms are seen in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a ACE inhibitor.
ACE cleaves the angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 therefore separates carbicillin-terminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses the angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can break a number of other peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradykin, Apollo, neurotensin, Dinorphin A and Gerlin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane flow of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and plays a role in the creation of Hart Nabil disease.
ACE2, as a transmembrane protein, plays the main point of entry point into cells for some coronaviruses such as HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Importantly, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and viral enzymatically in cells.
This entry process requires the preparation of S protein by TMPRSS2 protein protein protein is the host protein, which is recombinant in the current research process as possible treatment in the hands of the investigation. This hypothesis has been proposed to help reduce the levels of ACE2 in cells to cope with infection.
However, numerous professional societies and regulatory institutions have suggested that treatments with standard and ARB resonance are continuing.
A systematic review and published on July 11, 2012, found that \"use of ACE inhibitors was associated with an impressive 34% reduction of the probability of atrophy compared to controls.\"
In addition, the “absorption of pneumonia in patients treated with ACE inhibitors that were more likely to develop atrophy, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was associated with reducing the losses caused by atrophy, although the results were poorer than overall results.”
Human ACE2 is thought to be associated with a new therapy for acute lung injury, apparently hypnosis and oxygen saturation in the lungs of acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the effect period (months) of 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a preventative drug for people with sensitivity to systemic and classic resonance of rhACE2 (RSA receptors) or angiotensin II. The effect of rhACE2 injection was evaluated in clinical trials for acute respiratory distress syndrome treatment.
b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to detect contact within the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (attribution) who may have been in contact with an infected individual.
Several developed or proposed programs have been proposed to support government officials in some territories and regions.
Several frameworks have been developed to provide contact tracing programs.
There are problems with privacy, especially in software-based geographers’ geographic systems.
Less interfered solutions can be referred to using Bluetooth signals to log a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would be able to support Bluetooth-oriented apps directly in Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has developed a plan that citizens can help them understand whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
The program has been used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a program called TraceTogther is used.
The program is developed by the local IT community, released open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has released a Bluetooth-communication program called OneStopKorona! China has released a possible contact with infected people and provided an immediate response to treatment.
The program has developed the Ministry of Communications and Technology and Ministry of Health.
By April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for Google Play Store approval and Apple App Store approval.
On 12 April, the government announced that the contact tracing program is in the advanced stage of development and will be ready to be established within a few weeks. A similar program (StopCovid China) runs in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and South Korea have plans based on the TraceTogther app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to introduce a geological setting plan for patients with COVID-19 and the residents of Moscow to avoid leaving these people from home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, pointed to a number of applications related to program-oriented systems, including false positives and potential inactivity results if application is used in small population samples.
Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that are authorized to add coronavirus to the App Store, allowing only “official” or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders have expressed concerns about the implications of overall surveillance using coronavirus apps, saying in particular, that it is not clear whether surveillance infrastructure created for the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have demanded a statement to limit this kind of surveillance.
These organizations have taken eight conditions for government plans:
The monitoring must be “lawful, necessary and proportionate”;
End and supervision should have multiples with the possibility of automatic cancellation;
The use of data would have to be limited to COVID-19 cases;
Data security and anonymity must be guaranteed and protected based on evidence;
Digital surveillance should not cause discrimination and isolation;
Transfer data to third parties should be in the framework of the law;
Guarantees should be considered to prevent abuse and the rights of citizens to complain of abuse;
Targeted participation of all “relevant stakeholders”, including public health experts and groups in the margin, is essential. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) (RSF).
Google/Apple’s proposed program aims to address the problem of continuous monitoring through the removal of the device’s operating systems, after the need is resolved.
In some countries, it has been used instead of the network-replacement process, and therefore the need to download the program and the ability to escape is lost.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-oriented solutions that have access to raw location data may violate privacy.
However, not all systems with central server require access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems use central servers only for internal communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app system was used to track the call.
Instead of using the specialized program, the system collects tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and was potentially infected to inform people of the message.
In addition to using this information to message potential contacts, the government is available to the public. This type of disclosure of information has been authorized by the extensive changes in information protection laws, according to the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public via a number of apps and websites. Some countries, such as Germany, have considered use of centralized and privacy systems.
As of April 6, 2020, these details have not yet been disclosed.
The access to privacy is the concept of acceptance that the history of documented research dates back to at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, dozens of undergraduate groups were working on privacy protection solutions, such as the use of \"low Bluetooth Energy\" (BLE), to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a co-ordination effort that captures central and decentralized approaches and is not independent of the protocol. From decentralized protocols, it can be referred to the “intensive integration of privacy-preserving privacy” (DP-PPT/DP-3T), “Private Contact Numbers” (TCN, known as contact event numbers, CEN), “intensive privacy-preserving protocols” and “Central contact operations” (PACT).
In these protocols, personal identity data is never removed from the device, and all matching cases occur within the device.
\"Private Browsing\" has been involved in the development of SafePaths Media Lab, a platform to use privacy-preserving practices in the collection and consumption of location and pathological data to develop the COVID-19 outbreak.
The platform was developed based on the results of the results of the official report of the program: Personal Privacy Protection of Allies published in March 2020. Similarly, the SafeTrace platform is a SafeTrace product of Enigma MPC. The company is developing privacy technologies formed in the “MIT Media Lab”.
SafeTrace with secure hardware technologies allows users to place sensitive location and health data, without breach of data privacy, other users and officials.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN coalition was formed by a number of groups. These groups were surrounded by what was essentially similar and largely overlapping protocols, aiming to reduce the expansion and provide global cooperation in the field of development and warning programs, from key aspects of achieving widespread acceptance.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had given the BlueTrace protocol used in its official government program.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the Android and iOS platform controllers announced a contact initiative to keep their claim to be privacy. This initiative is based on the combination of \"Low Bluetooth Energy\" and privacy-preserving cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be launched in three stages:
Introduction to the ability of governments to create privacy-preserving coronavirus apps
Direct integration of this functionality on iOS and Android. Google and Apple are going to solve continuous admission and monitoring problems by distributing this system through operating system updates and then removing it in a similar way after the threat is resolved.
b'jaxinination of the drug (specific to change the application, change the profile, change the function or replacement of the drug) is said to alter the application of the approved drug for treatment of the disease or a different physical problem of what the drug was originally developed for.
This is a path of scientific research performed to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research objectives could be referred to as developing a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable plan for developing effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Husssein A A et al studied several proposed drugs at that time to resemble their skeletons with the most similar approved and analyzed drugs to accelerate the process of developing strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development in clinical study to be proposed in clinical study design.

There are extensive studies in Duke University and Oxford University.
The Langon NYU School of Medicine is implementing a trial on safety and effectiveness of the preventative use of hydroxychloroquine.
Clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir was \"clearly effective\".
The result was negative in 35 patients on average 4 days, while the illness was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir patients and half were given umifenovir.

It may not be safe for pregnant women or people who want to get pregnant.
The study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of leopinavir and uronavir, found that \"no benefit has been observed\".
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV replication through binding to the protease.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify these drugs to find a combination that can bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2.In the scientific community, criticisms have been raised to guide resources to change the application of drugs specifically designed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization included lupeninvir/ritonavir in the international \"community\" campaign.
Gilead Sciences developed Remdesivir as a treatment for the viral disease of Ebola and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later detected that Remdesivir was active in a laboratory environment against pheno viruses, pneumo, paramyxo and corona viruses.
One of the problems with antivirus therapy is to create resistance through mutations that may lead to more severe disease and isolation.
Some preliminary preclinical studies suggest that Remdesivir may be an effective genetic barrier to resistance formation. Several clinical trials include two cases where the Cleveland Educational Hospital is experimental. One person with mild disease and other people with severe illness is involved.
There are three clinical trials on the impact of intravenous vitamin C injection on people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19. Two of them are controlled by Darwinma (China and Canada) and one lack of control (Italy).

Pregnant or breastfeeding women who use effective contraceptive methods are not eligible for the study.
Several medications in Italy are studied.
The low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, which is why \" Italy's medical bodies\" are required to release its use instructions.
A multi-center study report included 300 patients to examine the effects of enoxaparin sodium over the prevention and treatment dose on 14 April in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a type of virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on changing the application of antiviral drugs that were developed to treat prior diseases such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was proposed according to the 7th edition of COVID-19 treatment
Ummi Fenovir: Uem Fnovir was proposed according to his 7th edition guidelines for treatment of COVID-19.
Antibodies that have been developed as a potential substitute for COVID-19 treatments can be referred to as following:
Tilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved in China.
Also refer to Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are several efforts to build this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the virus, to become available sooner than 18 months.
Five proposed vaccines were under Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The global outbreak occurred in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research activity for vaccine development.
Many organizations are using genomes published to produce possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was announced that CEPI initiative requirements for vaccine development include speed, production capacity, deployment on scale and global access.
In April, CEP scientists announced that 10 different technology platforms were under investigation and development to produce effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets that have entered Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I and proposed vaccine development: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and proposed vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 proposed vaccines are generally in early stages of development, 78 of them have been approved as an active project (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 other cases have been made publicly, but most of them are not publicly available (more likely to be in planning or design phase).
Phase I-II trials look at the safety and safety introductions, usually random and controlled with the drug, run at different centers and determine more precise and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants in a control group, while examining the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, affecting adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of 79 proposed vaccines in active development stage (up to early April 2020, 74 cases have not yet been tested on humans (they are still in clinical research phase).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the effectiveness of molecular contractive vaccines to modify viral proteins and simulate immune response.

The development and production of vaccine.
The partners later announced that they would take the Phase I clinical trial and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Health Ministry announced that they are being tested on 11 people in quarantine and that vaccine development would take at least one-and-a-half to two years.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, an active company in the field of technology in Quebec City, Quebec, announced the development of a coronavirus-like particle with a partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
The vaccine is proposed at the laboratory research stage, and its human trials will be conducted in July or August 2020.
Earlier the same week, the Guardian reported that Donald Trump, the president of the United States, had offered CureVac, saying that \"the German government has denied the possibility of exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine,\" which the German government had opposed.
On 17 March 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced cooperation with German company BioNTech to develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine, known as BNT162, is now in the clinical trial stage, and its clinical trials are being started in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, from active Italian companies in the field of technology, announced that the results of their clinical trials would be prepared in April 2020 and their final proposed vaccine may be tested before the fall of the human being.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the “resolved innovations against everyone” (CEP), from an investment of 1.9 million dollars in a research consortium of COVID-19 vaccine, including the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Win, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. With this investment, the total investment of COVID-19 vaccine development reached $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccine include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun six different vaccine candidates on animals.
The Royal College of London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing an RNA vaccine to fight against COVID-19.
The vaccine was proposed within 14 days of receiving sequence information from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced that $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on how to deal with COVID-19, including several proposed vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced that 192 million dollars specifically for COVID-19 vaccine development, and plans to establish a national \"vaccine bank\" of several new vaccines, with the potential for use in other cases as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on testing of PittCoVacc, a proposed COVID-19 vaccine, in rats, saying that \"the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines had strong antigen reactions [in mice] that were revealed within 2 weeks of safety.\"
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of DNA-based vaccine-based vaccine, likely to reveal the prediction.
Using low bacterial factors, the DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles.This process stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry department, and three U.S. universities merged their resources to access the superstars of IBM, as well as the cloud sources of Hewlett Packard, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have minor effects or unusual effects.
It may have benefits beyond disease prevention.
Another random reaction in Australia is to register from 4,170 active areas of health care.
vaccines may not be safe or effective at the production stage.
Early research to assess vaccine effectiveness using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate the need for biosafety-level 3 containment measures to work with live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety routines.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine for treatment or prevention of SARS that has been proven safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was the priority of governments and public health institutions around the world. There is no effective vaccine against MERS.
During the MERS outbreak, it was believed that current research on MERS will likely provide a useful template for vaccine development and drug development against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a MERS vaccine that had taken Phase I clinical trials in humans, and there were three other vaccines that were all unveiled. There were two non-diagnosis vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and a MVA-MERS-S vaccine.
A survey published in social media has prompted conspiracy theories about the recognition of the COVID-19 virus and the availability of vaccines.
The patents cited in various social media refer to previous genetic sequences and vaccines related to other strains of coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms are the fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms can be referred to fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, hearing loss and abdominal pain.
The distance from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some cases result in a viral pneumonia and multi-diabetic flaws.
By 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases worldwide were reported from 210 countries and territories, with 153,000 cases leading to death.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is mainly driven by close contact, often via droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
While the arm releases these droplets, droplets usually fall to the ground rather than moving over long distances or on surfaces.
People may be infected by touching surfaces and then touching the eyes, nose, and mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
The probability of popularity is higher in the first three days after the onset of symptoms. Of course, it is possible to spread the virus before symptoms emerge and in later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Wearing masks is recommended for suspected people to have the virus and those around them.
Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary; some authorities oppose the use of masks, and some consider wearing masks to be mandatory.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of every six areas covered by WHO.
People with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms can be referred to as difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the area of the chest, confusion, difficulty walking, face or lips. If these symptoms fail, you should immediately visit the doctor.
Symptoms of upper respiratory tracts such as pneumonia, septic shock, or sore throat have also been seen with fewer spread.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China at the early stage had only suffered from acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe heart pressure.
In some other, the disease may continue to develop to the phase of atrophy, multi-depressive defect, and even death.
This course is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms are revealed within 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected people are necessarily not present.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in the transmission process is not yet clear. Of course, preliminary evidence suggests that these people could be the cause of a disease outbreak.
The proportion of individuals without symptoms is unclear and is under investigation. \"KCDC\" has reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during the hospital.
\"The National Health Commission\" began on April 1, to include cases without symptoms in its statistics. Of the 166 cases of the infection that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can carry the virus.
Talking with a loud voice of more particles is scattered as compared to talking slowly.
Researchers have proven that wearing the mouth and nose during the cough may cause the spread of droplets below to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has reported that there is a possibility of air transmission and that there have been positive effects in air conditioners installed outside of the person’s rooms.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be spread and spread via the air.
While there are concerns it may be that viral transmission via faeces, this is unlikely to be the case.The virus is more likely to be transmitted through people.The risk of virus transmission is low before symptoms emerge.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that, despite the uncertainity of the disease transmission mechanism, each person usually infects two to three people. The duration of the virus on surfaces is several hours to days.
In particular, the virus on cardboard for a day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and on copper is 99% for a maximum of four hours.
Of course, this time depends on humidity and temperature.
The proper use of soap and detergent is also effective.Soap products remove the protective layer of the virus, infect it, and infect it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgents), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, corn samples were taken at an average of two days after the start of the bed.
In five patients of six patients, the first sample showed the virus above, and in the sixth patient, the highest viral load was seen in the second day tests.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All signs of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are seen in related coronaviruses.
The virus is destroyed outside the human body with household soap.Hand sanitizers are also eliminated.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
COVID-19 affects the most part of the lungs because the virus is regenerated through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to the host cell, which is vast in the I II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a “spillomer” to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was observed in 12% of infected people and hospitalized at Wuhan Hospital.The problem is more common in severe cases.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high because of the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of disease but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are in the heart and play a role in heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to pathophysiology.Cheapic abnormalities in people who died of COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammation containing lymphocytic in lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, acute respiratory distress syndrome has been found in patients with COVID-19.
In particular, the relationship between GM-CSF and IL-secreting T-cells was demonstrated by the absorption of inflammatory IL-6 monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported during childhood.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard diagnostic method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test usually takes place on respiratory samples obtained by the U.S.A., of course, a nasal swab or sputum sample.
Results are usually prepared within a few hours to two days.
The blood test can also be used, but this requires taking two blood samples at a time of two weeks. In this type of test, the result has no direct value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a species of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence.So laboratories around the world were able to run independently on polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect viral infection.
As of April 4, 2020, pedent tests (which have the ability to detect active infections and a person's history) were in the hands of the study but were not yet used.
The accuracy of this experiment is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines from Zhong Nan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical features and risk of all cirrhosis.
Multi-lobulated multi-lobe glass coarse is used with side distribution, non-regulating and deformity to detect in early stages of infection.
Concentration of cysts, stomach coverage (depending on a lipstick with a variable fragility) and stiffness may be a sign of the progression of disease.
There is little data about microscopic damages and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The most important pathological findings in cosmetology are:
Macroscopy: Inhalation of degenerative, Precardid, heart tightness and respiratory pain
Four levels of intensity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild airways: respiratory adenoid, pneumocyte, large pneumocyte, gastrointestinal inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multi-nucleated multi-cell formation
Severe nausea: damaged scattered bubbles (ADD) with scattered bubble acids.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Inhalation of nausea: formation of acids in bubble holes and respiratory fibrillation
Blood: Determination of the extermination (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection can include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, practising respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing and using an inner part of the elbow if no tissue is available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth face masks in public to some extent, in order to prevent the spread of disease by asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies involve reducing contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel and cancelling large gatherings.
The distance instructions also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There is no effective drug for preventing COVID-19 infection.As the discovery of a vaccine is not determined by at least until 2021, an important part of the COVID-19 management process is trying to reduce the epidemic, or the same as \"flattening the curve\".
The CDC also recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.The washing is more urgent, especially after using the toilet or when coughing or sneezing into the hands, before eating and after blowing one's nose, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% water and soap if available.For areas where regular hand sanitisers are not available, the WHO has provided two formulations for local production.
In these formulas, the antimicrobial agent is obtained from ethanol or isopropanol.
It is used to remove microbial acids of alcohol from hydrogen peroxide; \"This is not an active substance for drying hands.\"
glycol is added as moisture retention.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include liquid-demitism, oxygen support, and other vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the respiratory failure problem, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and lifestyle change and family diet have been recommended to strengthen safety.
Supportive treatments may be useful for people with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.The WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have offered recommendations to care for people who are hospitalized for COVID-19.
Special care professionals and health professionals in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions in a free resource called IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To fix the symptoms, some medical professionals have identified the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) to use the first line better than ibuprofen.
To prevent the possibility of virus transmission, precautions are essential, especially in healthcare settings where aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation or hand ventilation are performed.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.The CDC has published guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The proposed gear is: PPE gown, respirator or facemask, eye protection, and surgical gloves.In case, use of respirator (instead of facemasks) is priority.
The N95 respirator has been approved for industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized the use of the mask with the \"EUA emergency consumption assessment\".
The mask is designed to protect against atmospheric particles such as dust, but its effectiveness is not guaranteed against specific biological factors to consume outside the main application.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that it requires mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of them require these measures.
The type of respiratory support for people with respiratory failure from COVID-19 is being investigated regarding people hospitalized.Some evidence suggests that upper respiratory tract infections can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or biscuits in respiratory distress.
Whether each of these two methods leads to similar benefits in patients is still unclear.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation if exist because this method limits the amount of particle dispersion compared to the current-high flow nasal canal. The prevalence of more severe cases in older adults (over 60 years, and especially those over 80 years).
In many developed countries, the hospital bed sergeant is not enough.As a result, the health system capacity to manage sudden increase in the number of severe cases of COVID-19 required hospitalizations.
In a study conducted in China, it was found that 5% of people admitted to intensive care units would need mechanical ventilation and 1.4% would die.
In China, approximately 30% of people who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 are eventually hospitalized.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes much more difficult.
In order to maximize the amount of oxygen and reduce the likelihood of lung damage associated with the air conditioner and breast, the use of high pressure control devices and PPEP controls is essential.
Old ventilation devices may not have high PEEP.
Research into possible treatments started in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are at the clinical trial stage.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising among drugs.
While the development of new medications will take up until 2021, several of the drugs under the test have already been approved for other safetys or are in advanced testing phase.
Antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe disease.
The WHO has suggested volunteers participate in trials related to the effectiveness and safety of possible drugs. The FDA has issued a temporary license to use plasma as a test; however, in cases where a person's life is seriously or completely at risk.
This drug does not pass clinical studies necessary to prove the effectiveness and safety associated with the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the spread of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The program can identify 'the nearest call' to help monitor data and identify the possibility of a disease.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the app will report the subject to local health officials in addition to offering a home-based quarantine offer.The data analysis is used by mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking and artificial intelligence to track infected people and their related people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government provided the ability to track suspected individuals with COVID-19 infection in security institutions.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may have contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom assigned phone location data to the Robert Cook Institute, from German federal institutions, to allow research on the process of virus spread and prevent it.
Russia has used face recognition technology to identify quarantine people.
Giulio Gallera, Italy’s regional health agent, has been informed by mobile operators that “40% of people still go freely.”
The German government held 48 hours a week with more than 42.000 people.
Also, Kersti Kaljulaid, the president of Estonia, called for creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection may infect people.
The BBC said that \"social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, mental stress and economic problems can change people's mental and physical health.\"
The disease may be signs or symptoms in some few stages, and complications such as other common diseases affect the upper respiratory tract, such as cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, but improving people with severe or acute diseases may take three to six weeks.
Based on similar data from other viruses, such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be less at higher risk for COVID-19, but there is not much information about COVID-19.In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In severe cases, COVID-19 may rapidly become acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and causes respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.
The implications of COVID-19 related to COVID-19 can be referred to as infections, abnormal liver and cardiac failure, kidneys and liver.
Clotting abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, have been observed in 6% of people hospitalised due to COVID-19.The overall incidence of kidney failure among these individuals was 4%.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have seen indications of increased liver expression (transaminases).
According to the report, the average time between the emergence of symptoms and the death of ten days is about five days from the hospital.
Of course, in patients transferred to ICU, the average time distance between hospitalization and death was reported seven days.
Recent studies suggest that the average distance between initial symptoms to death was 14 days, but the full range of six to 41 days has been reported.
The National Health Commission (NHC) studies showed that men had a death rate of 2.8% and women 1.1%.
The tissue-absorbology of the lung samples of dead people consists of scattered bubble damage and cellular fibromyxid secretions in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The lung picture resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 1.8% of cases of deaths mentioned in China’s National Health Commission report, the increase in troponin levels or heart rate of stroke caused heart damage.
According to data from the U.S. March data, 89% of people have had pre-existing pre-existing conditions. The availability of medical resources and social-economic status of the region also affects the rate of casualties.
Estimates of the casualties caused by regional differences, as well as cognitive difficulties.
Few mild cases may cause overestimation rates.
Of course, the fact that death cases have been the result of previous cases may mean the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers, compared to non-smokers, are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are more likely to require intensive care or dietary care.The long-term implications of this disease have followed concerns.
The Hong Kong Hospital Journal reported that 20% to 30% of lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease and the presence of organ damage symptoms in the lung scan.
This may lead to post-integration syndrome following recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unclear whether the history of disease caused effective and long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It has been confirmed that, based on the behaviour of other CoVs, the outcome of COVID-19 infection in some cases was also positive.
It is believed that these are caused by the spread of infection and not again by infection.
It is thought to be natural and have animal origin through the infection.
The real origin is uncertain, but by December 2019 the outbreak was almost entirely based on human-to-human transmission.
With 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet magazine, the first item of its symptoms returned to 1 December 2019.
Official publications of the WHO announced the first cases of the emergence of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
To measure the mortality rate, it is usually used by different criteria.
These numbers change according to the region and over time and affect the volume of testing, health system quality, treatment options, time spent from initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned U07.1 emergency ICD-10 disease codes for death caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the laboratory and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 including clinical diagnosis or any known morbidities without SARS-CoV-2 infection.The infection rate is achieved by splitting the number of deaths based on the number of diagnosed cases in the laboratory at a given time.
According to John Hopkins University statistics, as of 17 April 2020, the global rate of casualties was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
This number differs from any region. Other measurements of the case mortality rate (CFR) indicate that the percentage of diagnosed people who die from the disease is different. The mortality rate of the infection (IFR) is another measure that determines the percentage of infected people (predicted and untreated) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not limited to time and follow a specific population from infection stage to case closing.
Although all infected people don’t necessarily produce powder, the presence of Python may provide information about the number of infected people.
In a small village of 4600, Castiglione d'Adda, the Wuhan outbreak in Italy, 80 tons (1.7%) were killed.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival Festivals.Supplement of young people caused relatively low mortality, and some cases of COVID-19 have not been officially replaced by the pandemic.
In addition, the German health system has maintained its effectiveness.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people, based on blood donors assessments, may produce Paddton.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have been confirmed by COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different between women and men.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate has been reported at higher men.
The highest likelihood of men in men is higher than 50 years old. This gap between women and men is eliminated at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The reasons for this sex difference are not clear, but genetic and behavioral factors may affect it.
Gender-based cognitive safety differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, and more men to same diseases such as hypertension, at lower ages than women may have contributed to the rate of mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of those died from COVID-19 who died.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not made an initiative to develop gender-related data on the subject of COVID-19 infection.
Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of patients, especially nurses, are monkeys, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that \"COVID-19\" was elected as the official name of the disease.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, announced that CO-virus, VI related to the virus, D-IV, and 19 related to its first identification time: 31 December 2019.
The name has been chosen to avoid references to specific geographical locations (e.g. China), animal species or group groups, based on international recommendations and targeting female label prevention.The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses the names \"the COVID-19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID-19\" in official communications.
This disease and its cause are commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\".
In early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the name \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\" were given both virus and disease.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization set 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as temporary names for the disease.The names were selected based on the 2015 guidelines on preventing the formation of locations for the virus and disease named disease.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers take action to produce health items such as forecasts and machine parts.
For example, in one case, an Italian hospital needed an air conditioner, and the supplier couldn’t provide it on time. As a local startup, the operation required reverse engineering and production of 100 valves overnight.
After the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and rapidly spread online.
This virus is apparently transmitted from humans to some animals.
Studies on the discovery of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chicken have no results.
No medication or vaccine is approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 are underway among government organisations, scientific groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization implemented the “communism of Unity” to assess the impact of treatment of four antivirus compounds that have the most promising one.
There is no vaccine yet, but various agencies are actively examining proposed vaccines.
Previous findings from SARS-CoV are being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are in the hands of research.
First, researchers in China are building a complete virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, inactivated, or died, is aimed at preventing the immune response of the human body from developing a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to build a vaccine that can sensitive the immune system to some subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this study is based on the S protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is related to nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method of vaccine development).
Experimental vaccines each of these strategies should be examined in terms of safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with the presence of four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus caused by the disease. The development of the Paddten-based vaccine has been raised as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2, but there is a debate in this area.
By April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been underway.
Seven clinical trials assessed treatments that were previously approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs are subject to changes in the application of more Chinese subject research, which is to be announced the outcome of phase III efficacy on remdessivir in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, clinical development of the COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates has been progressing.Penamine has been studied to treat COVID-19, which can be referred to as remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, dipeninvir and lopinavir/ritonavir with a combination of interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there was unrecognized evidence of remdesivir efficacy.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with non-remdesyvir prescriptions.
Phase III clinical trials in the United States, China, and Italy are currently underway.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was investigated in China in February 2020, and the preliminary results were released.
Of course, the community of researchers has been invited to review these results.
Korean and Chinese health agencies have proposed the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, said it was twice as dangerous and could be deadly.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization against hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, with the authority of physicians treating people with COVID-19.In order to confirm 7 February, the name interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory environment.
Paseaseaseaseaseaseaseaseasease, after its lower concentration effects were proved to be insufficient in the recombinant of SARS-CoV-2 replication, it has been suggested for investigation in the human body.The investigation has shown that initial spike protein preparation with transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with/donomycin have major limitations that prevented the medical community from embracing these therapies.Etamivir in the laboratory does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and whose role has not been proven to be in treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm may be severe in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
Evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine has anti-cytokine storm properties. \"The National Health Commission\" included Tizilumab following a brief review in the treatment guidelines.
After taking this drug in people with severe disease, the drug was tested at a national level in Italy.
By combining the blood tests of Frieden to identify cytokine storms, it is used to deal with the development, which is the cause of the death of some people with the disease.
The FDA approved the receptor-introduction receptor-6 based on previous studies for treatment of cytokine release syndrome, which is caused by another cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, random and controlled evidence has not been presented on the effectiveness of the cytoplasmab effectiveness of the treatment of CRS.
The transmission of pure and thickened antibodies in the immune system of recovered people from COVID-19 to people who need it as a non-compulsive method of passive immunisation.
This strategy was tried for SARS and its results were not certain.
Viral neutralisation is the possible mechanism of action by which a dead-end drug for defence against SARS-CoV-2.
Of course, other structures, such as cytotoxic citrate, and/or phagocytosis, may be effective.
Other forms of inactivated treatment, such as using synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are under investigation.
Production of spikes, which include the liquid portion of the blood taken from recovered people and have special antibodies on the virus, may increase for faster development.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Central Hospital of Wuhan, died of COVID-19 later on, and after public contact with the outbreak.
