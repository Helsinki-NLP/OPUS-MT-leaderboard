Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, while at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2020, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as being a novel coronavirus now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since, the illness resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date is that ca 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In ca 14% cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospitalisation while the remaining 6% cases experience critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK, and compare them to that of Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy during 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Subsequent to China, COVID-19 underwent further geographical spread and the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of this country.
On 11 March, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the 5 March issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), whereby between 31 December 2019 and that date included, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide is received from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and the WHO, and are updated each day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used for assessing the trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and the UK, and comparing them to that in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the 1 January to 15 March 2020 period.
We also presented the cumulative number of notified cases of each country as at 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared with that of 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends in the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK overall, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This was mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increasing trends of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared with that in Italy for 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It highlights that as at 15 March 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy just 3 weeks prior or less.
Our results indicate that the number of notified cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in EU/EEA countries and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable speed in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients that must be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
Early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which ca 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, among EU/EEA countries, only 6% and 1% cases have been reported, data on admission of COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or into intensive care (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic fashion to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study performed in 11-2010 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in January 2014).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 cases associated with a & gt; 90% risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far clustered in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a regional catchment population, information about cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience from Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring healthcare, and in particular intensive care, such as the one occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, comprehensive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of patients may not have enough opportunity to determine, accept, and apply appropriate responses.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have a short time period of time to further increase their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure on healthcare.
Failing this, it is likely that the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a surge of patients that require intensive care within the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject.
We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this review will be effective in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory to all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors for all the holiday and for many weeks after due to the outbreak of a novel viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to near 5 other countries all over the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and over 3,000 patients who died.
The World Health Organization of COVID-19 has warned that COVID-19 is the number 1 general public and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 200 scientific papers have been published on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
This review considers research progress in new and swiftly developing areas.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-caused disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some remaining yet urgent questions.
CoVs have been traditionally considered nonlethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs twice, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to other countries with horrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1,1, clusters of pneumonia that had unknown origins were first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the sequence of the CoV was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic rapidly spread to the neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, the infection of health-care providers was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all its public transportation stopped.
On January 24 the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the starting site of the disease from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and near 50 other countries all over the world.
Since the situation is rapidly evolving, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remain to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study on 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented a more updated illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly at the age of 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected individuals were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 infected individuals were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expanded in clusters mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction number (R <sub>0</sub> was 3.77 (approximately: 3.55-4.51) and the R <sub>0</sub> adjustable was 4.82-2.23.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, matching the time of massive transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.86-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses containing a single strand of sense RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultrathin sections of human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than that of SARS-CoV, which is coincident with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 also forms a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which could be used as a measure of CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and intermediate host
It has been known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civet cats and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the main host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, what intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route is yet to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans which involved homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - long-snouted, ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1% difference spread between two genomes is still a big difference; thus, conclusive results for concrete evidence are awaited (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and hence is susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
Generally, the virus is first identified by the host immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-type lectin-like receptors, TLR-like receptor (NLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limit the spreading of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from the immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4 <sup>+/sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> play an important role in the defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing apoptosis of T cells.
The humoral immunity including complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also essential in combating the viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, multi-organ failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, featured by clustering onset, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common that for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised, they have higher chance to be infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1,099 cases demonstrates that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, mentioned above, noted by the demography of 8,866 patients, described the incubation period 4.8 (7.2-3.0) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected but symptomless people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to, or infected by, the virus have to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the major and initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by no symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients with acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy were observed in patients.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December of 2019 showed that the percentages of the symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of the patients required ventilation support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
Comparably, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with the higher lethality of MERS than of COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed with MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been found that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and ventilation support was required for approximately 14%-20% of the patients.
By February 14, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.
Comparably, the mortality of SARS by November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that the <i>R</i><i><sub>0</i> was the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 6.47 was associated with a 95% interval (CI) of 5.71-7.71, whereas the <i>R0</i> SARS-CoV-2 was only 2.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding their symptoms, mortality, and <i>R</i><i><sub>0</i>,</i>, in Table 1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Thus, it is much more challenging to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clustered onset often happens within a family or community or a single vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the recent two weeks before the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms longer than two weeks and cured patients discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, which sends out an alarm to increase the time for quarantine.
At the early stage, the number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) is normal or reduced in patients.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count & lt; 1×109/L including lymphocyte count & lt; 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and featured by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop an atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS happens, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely compromise the exchange of respiratory gas.
Dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and heightening the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst chest radiographic findings often parallel the most severe extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the major criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations started to be used for diagnosis (which no longer solely relied on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and imperative for making an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at <sup>18</sup> and <sup>18</sup>10×10/10 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter) using a dipstick in less than an hour without requiring elaborate instrumentation.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically enhance the sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, physicians mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while attempting a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major threat to the patients and the major cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is critical to relieve the symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of the vital organs are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that a cytokine storm results from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response featured by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a vast number of free radicals which are the major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include the modulation of T cell-directed immune response; the blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high dosages were not beneficial to severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they may cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the prognosis.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate doses have been recommended to be used prudently for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been found to be efficacious in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur following combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in the patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
The collection of the blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from catching the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, which detect unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to propose the method for large-scale use before specific therapies are not yet developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with the plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which may lead to a life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for the plasma is large to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies rapidly enough to fight against a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more critical and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
This way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects largely rely on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of TCM.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or vague as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or for patients who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.
The highest rates of treatment for COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), whereas Hubei province, which used TCM in only approximately 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is quite a rough comparison as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and coworkers published a study to compare western medicine (WM) treatment alone with combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the times needed for body temperature recovery, symptom disappearance, and hospitalization were remarkably shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM only group.
Interestingly, the rate for symptomatic worsening (from light to severe) was remarkably lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM only group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group than for the WM only group (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await more well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be intriguing to characterize the mechanism of actions and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 mostly experience great fear of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as adverse effects of the treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to distress and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as a part of the public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of the contagion, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, and people in contact with them as well as the general public who are in need.
The psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with others.
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected humans to susceptible hosts and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and potent neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and lethal-challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection have yet to be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because SARS died down 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions owing to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS by using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task for controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty because of the long period of time (averaged 18 months) needed for vaccine development and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a novel disease, COVID-19 has just started to manifest its full clinical course throughout thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies reported thus far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly happened at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of those patients being over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (at the median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000) as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main reason for death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which might lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and might interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The C-reactive protein level in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed to be a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery.
The correlation of CRP level to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also be effective in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed extensively in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunctions.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with the other issues for the prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressant commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with life-long disability and low life quality.
Thus, if needed, steroids should be used at lower dosage and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and friends.
It is imperative to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients at the early phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, causing great difficulty for the control of the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when the patients are severely ill, while most transmission did not happen at the early phase.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Great efforts are currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have been dramatically damaging the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downswing phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which seems substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier.
However, promising signs are also seen in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating the current strategies might have been working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, via strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has eventually been put under control.
It is possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 might become weaker in infectivity and eventually die down or become a less pathogenic virus co-existent with humans.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmittable through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which raises a new possibility of feces-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study on 138 patients reported that 41% of the cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health-care providers.
Thus, great precaution should be used to protect humans, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection is through wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking onto surfaces of materials, where they could be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, health-care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care providers should wear fitted isolation gowns in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he wore an N95 mask; the virus might have entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Thus, health-care providers should also wear transparent face shields or goggles when dealing with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly suggested that everybody wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to lower the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a novel virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused high alert to China based on her deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, not until 19 January 2020 did the director of the Center of Disease Control of Wuhan comfort the citizens by saying that the novel virus has low contagiousness and limited reproductivity from human to human and that it is not possible to prevent and contain the disease.
This message remarkably relaxed the alarm of the public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time was missed to contain the disease on its minimal scale in Wuhan.
The disease control agencies in China may take this hard lesson and make critical improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should be more careful when informing the general public because any information referred to as \"people\" will be considered, and their attitude and understanding can change them; (2) more sensitive and responsive to the information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports of doctors or authorities; (3) more aggressively to contain a potential epidemic in early stages rather than attempting to calm the public; (4) consistently, objectively, and effectively targeting public information to increase and improve public awareness about epidemic diseases, and continue to test and improve community response systems.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 started in the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread all over China and near 50 other countries globally at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar to COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS recurring.
However, there are some remarkable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating the patients.
COVID-19 affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women, and the severity and death rate are also higher in elderly individual than in youth.
SARS has higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the disease even when they are symptomless whereas SARS patients do so usually when they are severely ill, which causes much greater difficulty to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and broader than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can be positive for the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of virus spreading.
Given this rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several critical issues remain to be solved, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homolog was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the original host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing answers to 1 and 2, we cannot efficiently cut the transmission, and the outbreak may relapse at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
As long as these questions are not answered correctly, we will not be able to achieve fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission among humans?
Will it become a pandemic worldwide, die down like SARS or relapse periodically like the flu?
The answer to the above question and many other questions is essential, but it may take some time.
However, with whatever expense it may demand, our only option is to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring our life back to normal.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well.
Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses harbouring the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases amongst RNA viruses were termed “CoVs” because of their crown-like morphology under electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1~16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for the structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV genera contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, like common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly-identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infection in relatively more patients with a higher chance to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients with common cold in mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge was accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
Indeed, the concept had been widely accepted that infection with HCoVs is generally harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history, infecting over 8,000 people with a crude case fatality of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spreading to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), which has subsequently been renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world has to prepare for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin from bats, mice and domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence support an evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework to understand the natural history, driving force and restriction factors of species jumping.
It may also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifying animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2, and be used to prevent future spillovers.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
Particularly, we highlight and discuss the common theme that parental viruses of HCoVs are typically non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also review the trend of HCoV evolution in which the increase in transmissibility often comes with the decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal discharge of patients who had contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in various infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the year of 1966, and was subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented with common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore-throat, with fever and cough seen in 10-20% cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brains of suckling mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and they tend to be predominantly transmitted during the season of winter in temperate climate.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by an approximately 2-week illness.
According to a human volunteer study, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
China, also known as atypical pneumonia, was the first well documented HCoV-caused pandemic in human history and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
Apart from the super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case could give rise to approximately two secondary cases, with a incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the peak of viral load appearing on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, deranged liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase of macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract, multiple organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied with a cytokine storm, which might be lethal particularly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands during late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory illnesses.
Presentation of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of a similar virus from a nasal specimen from an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in Netherlands, it is actually distributed worldwide.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Besides community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All these four community-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, though accidents did occur for unknown reasons as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the abilities to transmit efficiently and to maintain themselves continuously within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spreads to close contacts have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
A secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is unique for MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high case fatality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
During middle to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients retrospectively known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude case fatality of 3.4%.
It is important to note, the case fatality rate in Hubei is 4.2%, while outside the country reaches 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and might contribute to its rapid spreading around the world.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is a bit lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages in humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, same as the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under some circumstance remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also of particularly great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spreading after passages in humans will be influential on the ultimate fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
All four community-acquired HCoVs causing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs have to replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people that it infects, the greater chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission in humans could be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, triggering common cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and their transmission within humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spillover to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
This will determine whether it will adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will serve us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Likewise, a reservoir host harbours HCoV continuously and for long term.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host right before or around its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host to allow the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot sustain its transmission within the intermediate host.
On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the index case of SARS had a contact history with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared with that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a racoon dog in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after killing all civets in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civets from wild or farms without exposure to the live animal markets were generally negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets might only serve as the intermediate amplifying host but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that multiple species of small mammals might also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV unveiled a closely related bat CoV, termed SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats host emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none except for one designated WIV1 can be isolated as live virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from fecal sample of bats was demonstrated to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptor for cell entry.
Intriguingly, sera of convalescent SARS patients were capable of neutralizing WIV1.
Thus far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV to the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV utilize the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
Up to now, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, such as camels of Middle East origin in multiple African countries.
Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that generally mild symptoms but massive virus shedding were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels shed viruses not only through respiratory route but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for virus shedding from bats.
However, questions still remain since many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels prior to symptom onset, resulting in human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species that harbour MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to assign parental relationship.
In other words, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat CoVs are found in future.
Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a probable animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbour ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These novel pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They cluster into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, which share a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, albeit a higher degree of sequence homology genome-wide.
An earlier study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which turn out to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different assembly methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently there is no evidence in support of a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.
Whereas the highest sequence homology has been found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
A counter-proposal is in favour of recombination between a pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs.
The jury is still out on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Besides highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E might have originated from bat CoVs, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that a bat CoV termed ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolored bat displayed close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, termed Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected as its intermediate host.
For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in the history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpacas might have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in feral animals.
Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not too surprising that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, whereas bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels might serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all favourable conditions for bats to be an ideal pandemic for bats.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.
The virus is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if there is any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
Particularly, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They might be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have to be ruled in or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share the ecological niche with bats through butchering or mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of intermediate amplifying host to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced.
Humans contract the virus through butchering and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 might have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still on.
Apart from different types of the animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be regarded as high as possible for CoVs based on an average substitution rate of approximately 10-4 substitution per year at a location 2, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to novel hosts.
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, deletion of which results in exceedingly high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, mutation rate is usually high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggestive of a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is likely that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift would render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective quickly.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the probability for interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of novel CoVs when the conditions become appropriate.
This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the end of the 3 through the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique Publishing mechanism.
In a host that serves as the mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
Besides three viral factors stated above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor influential on interspecies transmission.
Herein, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, and evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein.
Generally, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the RBD and 4 of them locate in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which might increase the affinity of the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions might be critical to viral adaption to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implicates that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ACE2 might have altered.
Indeed, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other coreceptor might be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Intriguingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They might also account for successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other host dependency and restriction factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and rodents might constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs have to usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for a successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction have to be identified and characterized.
An unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR might be fruitful.
Emergence of novel HCoVs: back to ground zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be adaptive mutation that facilitates the switch between hosts.
Besides, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination positions were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Likewise, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from relieving viruses from selection pressures exerted, such as by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, owing to a two-nucleotide deletion.
Although ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affects proofreading by exoribonuclease, thus providing the selection pressure for the generation of virus strains highly pathogenic when introduced to a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains might also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not by chance that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate robustly without eliciting a strong host immune response.
Herein lie the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes the severe cases in human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and the cytokine storm wherein the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been de-coupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of delinking the immune response might have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response in bats is particularly strong.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
By this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 might be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose.
Whereas a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there also exists a bat-CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Whereas civets and other animals in the markets have been found to harbour viruses identical to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolins might serve as one of intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either deliberately or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
Pervasive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat origin and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing wet markets and killing civets therein could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
By the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remain to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important tool for transportation as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.
They are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as what was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spreading of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV in camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
As we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
Particularly, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are so diverse.
There are plenty of opportunities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Due to the ordeals of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spillover.
Although bats have many features that favours the spreading of viruses, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of the zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be of interest to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans get into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins has to be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical are found in its natural hosts in future.
Continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 “suspected case” and “confirmed case” is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our team had published a rapid guideline for diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provided our experience and make good reference for fighting against this pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated.
In this letter we answered one comment on our guideline and provided the newest diagnostic criteria of “suspected case” and “confirmed case” according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) offered by the People’s National Health Committee.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is now officially named as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advice guideline and that has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
This has attracted a lot of attention since published.
Note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), among 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts being substantively changed.
Now our guideline received a comment by Zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence for our guideline and also make valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We confirm their significant efforts and express our thanks.
However, their work also needs update according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Trial seventh version) and recently studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case needs to combine any one item of epidemiological history features with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or needs to meet three items of clinical manifestations if without clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases had been reported in the last 14 days before symptom onset; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 cases (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contacting with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 had been reported in the last 14 days before symptom onset; (4) a history of contacting with cluster of confirmed cases (2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurred within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, workplace, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count in the early onset stage.
Diagnosing the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with one of three pathogenic or serological cases as follows: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the novel coronavirus; (3) positive for the specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in serum test; or a change of the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody from negative to positive or a 4 times higher than that in the recovery phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications based on the researchers’ continual efforts to search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as the samples from respiratory tract including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and supported bringing the antibody positive result into the confirmed criteria.
Besides, there are more and more evidence that remind us to caution with the atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Hence, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as “low risk”.
The score system also needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
In the end, we hope more direct evidence is available, and we want readers to present their comments.
For the diagnosis of “suspected case” and “confirmed case”, we suggest to follow and follow the latest guidelines of their countries.
Our team will also timely update our guideline to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, a daily highest
Yesterday, Bangladesh has confirmed five deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of fatalities in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of recorded infected cases included 114 cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, the director of IEDCR, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the fatalities included four males and one female.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were aged above 60, two between 51 and 60, and one 41-50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be shut down more than initially planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport shutdown had initially started on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods -- medical, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
The first recorded incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On 19 March, these three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 surpasses one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections surpassed one million worldwide, Johns Hopkins University data indicated.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries remaining free of coronavirus infections.
By yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty four hours preceding 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, over 244 thousand coronavirus cases were recorded, linking to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, there were over 1,000 US deaths on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the disease from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city lockdown to May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin declared Russians would be paid without going to work until April 30.
The parliament of Portugal voted to extend the state of emergency by 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, 10 vote in favor, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia declared curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to last the entire day; previously, the curfew was only imposed between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced the state had extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toilet paper to two and one package per transaction in all stores in the country.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit, on Monday.
These limitations were posted as messages on the checkouts and on the chains' Facebook pages.
Buyers were reportedly stocking up due to fears of COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes followed the previous four-pack per transaction restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
The Coles Supermarkets reported on 8 March that, despite the four-pack restriction, many stores are selling out at least an hour after delivery and calling the demand below a record, while ALDI, in its Facebook post on Tuesday, called it unofficial sales.
According to Vulworth, the sale went up with a high-speed sultanatorium.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packs last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coles ordered bigger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, and ALDI made stocks for a planned Wednesday special.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers try to raise stock, but local authorities' restrictions on the timing of truck-deliveries make it hard.
He expects rising production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer specials.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the early release of stock, some stores can't sell Wednesday special.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the stores fill their stock every night.
He remarked toilet paper is a bulky item, leading to low quantity of stocks in plenty, and, when sold out, leaves large shelf spaces empty, hardening the feeling of a shortage.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that Coles and Woolworths thought it would be possible if there were enough goods in the shelf, if there were enough product available, such as toilet paper and hand sanitizers, you would probably be able to minimize the panic buying.
Recycled toilet paper producer Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday they'd run out of stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the manufacturer of Clear Flex Toilets and Solaris Papers, emphasized that they were working 24 hours a week to meet the need for the market.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported some property sellers offering free toilet paper to the first bidder on auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because of buyers having time off on the long weekend of Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert meant to be cut up and used as toilet paper.
The stores were originally reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on the purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitiser, dried goods, handwash and flour.
Similarly, outside of Australia, on Sunday evening online British supermarket Ocado was observed limiting purchases of toilet paper to two 12-roll packs.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
China, although the word cypnamine refers only to how widely a disease has spread, not how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO noted the need to drive governments to China: China.
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom said that if countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilize their people in the response, it would be possible that countries detect, test, treat, isolate themselves.
We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, formerly the director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is unprecedented.
China said, in remarks published by CNN in February, other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from emergence to continuous global spread.
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying: “We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus.
He continued, and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's director, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, \"bottom line, it's going to get worse.\"
As of Thursday, Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate has been estimated to be 4% in China, while globally ranging from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant virus cases.
Due to reduced travel and closures of heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases mostly had links to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.
Of the early cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case traced back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, may have been the first infected.On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases in China, in Italy, Iran, and South Korea suddenly increased, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be substantial underreporting of cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among youths, with those 19 and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide.The United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to become infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
Cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, up to 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published 30 March estimated that numbers of infections in Italy were considerably greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who are not, the time from development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February about 80% of deaths were in those over 60, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.Official tallies of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to people tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The number of true fatalities from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing - e.g. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death tally by a factor of 4-5x.
China's U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that it was less reliable than true.Concerpted reports from an understatement in the United States confirm this statement.A lower estimate often occurs in pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1) swine flu pandemic.The first confirmed death was reported in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths each were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039 out of 1617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates for the death-to-case ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptom onset 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptom onset after 1 February 2020).Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.
A number of academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection fatality rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results from the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO asserts that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, \"Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.
China, but it is almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when the disease will end.
China's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus, it could be possible to finish until June.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 is circulating, potentially for one or two years.
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more) in China.
Sir William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, \"I believe it's unlikely that the virus will disappear completely - as it is very contagious and it may turn into a seasonal disease that will relapse every year.\"
The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.The WHO states that approximately one person in six becomes seriously ill and experiences acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.The more progress of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm infection, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact to confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from few to 44%.
The incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) varies from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days.As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later fell to 15%.
Some details about the outbreak are still being determined.
The outbreak is believed to be primarily spread during close contact and by small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; with close contact being within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that, when coughing without covering, droplets can move from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that stay for more prolonged periods in the air, such as when talking.Respiratory droplets may also be produced during breathing out, although the virus is not generally airborne.
These droplets may enter the mouth or nose of people who are near us and fall into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolised and thus result in airborne spread.
It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, and mouth.
While there are concerns it may spread by faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has rejected the possibility of faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may also be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before onset of symptoms suggesting transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
Only few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies based on the humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence animals can pass the virus on to humans, though British authorities advise washing one's hands after contact with animals, like after contact with other surfaces infected people could have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains.
It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the viruses from pangolins and humans.
Compared to the total genome to date, there are 92% of genetic material shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host.
Infection by the virus can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, though confirmation is ultimately by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many of its imaging features overlapping with other pneumonias and disease processes.
Before March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that the CT should not be used to screen for or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with the first issued on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
Generally this test is carried out on a nasopharyngeal swab though a throat swab may also be used.A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these has been proved sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States a serological test designed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging features on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include glass opacities and absent effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, and can be used as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks were developed to detect imaging features of the virus in radiographs and CT.
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue and putting the tissue directly into a waste container.
Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members do not know where or how they were infected.Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, over a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they've been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, though many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to disinfectant for stainless steel surfaces), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.25% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or medical facility, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons, should also be disinfected.
Health organizations recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and disposing of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
One According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing a mask can reduce the propensity of people to touch their face, which is the major cause of infection with hands. Masks have also been recommended for those who care for a disease.
The WHO has recommended the wearing of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have started to encourage the use of face masks by members of the public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face mask made out of cloth.China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the community, particularly when coming into close contact (1 metre (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health officials are encouraging people to make cloth facemasks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government mandated that everyone entering a grocery store may wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-March, required passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear face masks on 1 April.
Panama has made it obligatory to wear a face mask whenever going outside, while also recommending the manufacture of a homemade face mask for those who cannot purchase face masks.
Face masks were widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres.
Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
Prior to 22 March 2020, Germany banned the large number of persons and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems at high risk for severe disease and complications, and, according to CDC advice in areas of community spread to stay home.In late March 2020, the WHO and other health organizations changed the term “social distancing” with physical distancing to determine whether the aim is to reduce physical contact and at the same time preserve social contact, or avoid distant social contact.
The use of the term \"social distancing\" has led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to have a limited sex with a partner who does not have symptoms and symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most serious self-quarantine instructions have been issued to high risk groups.
Those who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
Strategies in the control of an outbreak are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may control the spread of the virus include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; public measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; public gathering to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such to clean up surfaces.More drastic actions aimed at containing the disease were implemented in China when the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and restricting travel.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic speed) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.
Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, as soon as possible), if that isn't the case when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medications approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing medications.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen outcomes.
Several compounds that were previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also stated that some domestic and traditional features of China could reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and the European regional office of the WHO has issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services to convert resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures if possible, separating and quarantine of COVID-19 patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may trace back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of these were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus was found from these kinds of animals; or, in other words, has a zoonotic origin.A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December, and under the doctor Zhang Jixian was placed in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
China on 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues of a coronavirus-like coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were admonished by police for spreading false rumours, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later released a public notice on 31 December and informed the WHO.
Enough cases of unknown pneumonia had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to trigger an investigation in early January.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls.

Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised central banks' and states' timely emergency measures.
Central banks reacted faster than the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advice of governments to avoid travel to other countries.
As a consequence, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
Its impact on the cruise industry was so much that it had never been seen before.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments cancelled events such as the New Year festivals held in large numbers, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, Chinese and regional authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most workplaces not to re-open until that date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations.The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50% drop.
This also resulted in a severe decline in shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak can affect up to 47 million jobs in the United States and increase unemployment rate by 32%.The lockdown in India has resulted in over 10 million Indian migrant workers (who are already in need) unemployed.The results from the Angus Reid Institute showed that 44% of Canadian households have been affected by a form of unemployment.As a full-length quarantine in mid-March 2020, more than 100,000 workers have lost their jobs.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit (University).Almost half a million companies in Germany implemented short-term working plans for workers with government subsidies called Kurzarbeit.
The German short-time work compensation program has also been accepted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting organizations' operations as well as individuals - including employees and independent people around the world.
Arts and culture sector organizations attempted to support their (often publicly funded) mission to allow the public to access cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists if possible.
By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response there have been intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.Another recent and rapidly accelerating fallout of the disease is the cancellation of religious events, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption.The Vatican announced that Holy Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of 40 days have been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended older Christians to stay at home rather than attending Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, online broadcast or television, while others recommend individual visas.
According to the Roman Catholic Church, great and small churches and St. Peter's Square have been emptied from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies have also cancelled services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and temples.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the sporting calendar since the Second World War.
Most major sporting events have been either cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019–20 NBA season, and 2019–20 NHL season.
China disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics which were originally scheduled to begin in July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would turn into another history beyond 2020 but will not be late in the summer of 2021.Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have been either postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to move online, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in their rates of entry to their site.The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concert trips.
Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances.
One of the artists has explored ways to continue to produce and share work through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based internet imaging for artists to perform, distribute, and publicize their works.
Online, numerous coronavirus-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, heightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism have been noted toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and violence have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of the cases had still been confined to China) have documented racist sentiments expressed in various groups worldwide of Chinese people deserving the virus or receiving what has been claimed as justified retribution.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
There have been support for online and non-invasive areas affected by the virus in China.
Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subjected to suspicion and xenophobia.Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions lobbying to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan trended on Twitter.
Chinese people as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the Chinese coronavirus, a term considered by critics to be racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students who come from Northeast India, which shares a border with China, and study in major Indian cities have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The President of the Baharata Party's State Department of the Baharya Janata in South Bengal stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature, and that's why God took revenge on them.
The following statements were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata.In China, xenophobia and racism had been prevalent against non-Chinese residents after the pandemic, and foreigners had been penned as foreign coalists or had to be thrown into trash.
Many newspapers with paywalls have removed them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.

Laboratory testing for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus' RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to only detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to report or who were asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are massive variations in how much testing has been done across countries.
This variability is also likely to be significantly affecting reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be significantly over-estimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) the test can be done on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours or maximum to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with throat swabs is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later on, the virus can disappear in the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternatively sample material can be taken from the deep airways by suction catheter or coughing up material (sputum) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Berlin in January 2020 by Charité in Berlin, where the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used, and provided the basis for the construction of 250,000 kits shared by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test by 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
The epidemiology that exists in all types of beta-CoVs and the RdRp gene that exists only in SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was the first company to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Organization for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided the United States Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel 2019 (2019-nCoV) through the International Reagent Resource Laboratory.
One of three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits caused inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, and a bottleneck of testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of 100 samples a day being successfully processed throughout the whole of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was not until then that state and local laboratories were permitted to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization.US commercial labs began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced nationwide availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics similarly made nationwide COVID-19 testing available as of 9 March 2020.
No quantity limitations were announced; specimen collection and processing must be performed based on CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare.On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test which could be performed within 3.5 hours and in volume, thus allowing one machine to do approximately 4128 tests every 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid similarly received EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Given that this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can determine positive results within 5 minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States, and Abbott expects to produce at least 50,000 tests per day with an increase in production.There is currently a test in Taiwan that uses a monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus; this type of test can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid influenza test.
As of March 2020, surveys concluded that chest radiographs are of little value in early stages of disease, while CT findings may be present even before symptoms appear.
Typical features on CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacificities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many of its imaging features overlapping with other pneumonias and pneumonias.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used to screen for or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19.As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals aged 7 days or so after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and for population surveillance.Assays can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
High-power automated systems in many labs will be able to perform these assessments, but their availability depends on the production for each system.
For CLT a single specimen of peripheral blood is commonly used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods an extraction step is not needed before assay.On 26 March 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as required and are now therefore able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only a single test has been approved by the FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours and therefore much faster than the conventional PCR assay of viral RNA.
The antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the infection.In early April, the UK found none of the antibody test kits it purchased were sufficiently good to use.
Hong Kong has set up a scheme where suspected patients can stay home, emergency supplies a sample tube to the patient, spits into the tube, send it back and receive a test result after a while.The UK's Public Health Service (NHS) has announced that it is piloting a scheme where suspected cases are being tested at home to avoid transmitting an ambulance if necessary.In drive-through testing for suspected cases, a healthcare professional is using appropriate precautions.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest, most-extensive testing of any country.In Germany, the National Association of Legal Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March, that it had a capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in the ambulance and 10.700 had been tested in the prior week.
When a doctor prescribes a test, health insurance is taken.
According to Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March drive in tests were offered in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, because only positive results were reported.
China’s first lab research showed that as of March 12, 2020, there were at least 483,295 samples tested for a week in their view, 12/20, which resulted in a positive SARS-CoV-2 test for 3,491 (63.9%) test.In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed a method for testing samples taken from 64 patients simultaneously, where all samples were combined and tested together, and samples were tested once positive.A emergency detection laboratory in Wuhan named Liu-Yanjan (Chinese: تتت تتوتتو تتونی تی تونی تی توند تی تی تولی تتتی تیلیليلی تی تتتتتتی تی تتیتیتتیتیتتتتتتیتتتتتیتیتیتیتتتتتتتتتتی 5, which was released on 5 February 5 February 2020 by BG 2020 by BGI 2020 by BGI, which can test 10,000 samples can be tested in February 2020 by BG.
BGI-founder Wang Jian observed the project that lasted five days; clear that if this capacity had not been added, cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity hadn't been added.
The Wuhan Laboratory has been promptly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
By 4 March 2020 the daily throughput totals were 50,000 tests per day.Open source, composite materials released by Origami Assays have been released and can be tested using up to 112 people for COVID-19 using only 93 assays. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent has become a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU and UK and the United States.
This has led some researchers to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March it was announced United Arab Emirates was now testing more of its population than any other country in front of the coronavirus, and is on track to scale up the level of testing to reach the full population.
China was through a combination of drive-through capability, and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on Chinese-based emergency detection laboratories in China).
The laboratory, built within 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to be operational outside of China.
Different testing recipes targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The WHO adopted the German recipe for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying available tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and those countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to satisfy demand and recommendations for testing by health experts.
In contrast, experts say South Korea's broad availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the WHO announced the cancellation of testing programmes as the best way to slow the advance of COVID-19 pandemic.High demand for testing due to wide spread of the virus caused backlogs of hundreds of thousands of tests at private U.S. labs, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents became strained.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in their test kits.
China in the United States purchased test kits developed by the CDC; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing.Spain purchased test kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that results were inaccurate.
The company explains that the incorrect results may be the result of a failure to receive the appropriate sample or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry of Defense announced that it would collect incorrect results and convert them into a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of test kits the Czech Republic purchased from China gave wrong results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China which were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested these be dumped into the Danube.The Turkish Health Ministry, a member of the test kits Turkey purchased from China, said they had high error rates and did not have antibodies.The UK purchased 3.5 million before China but in early April 2020, announced these were not usable.
Testing, followed with quarantine of those who tested positive and tracing of those with whom the SARS-CoV-2 positive people had contact, resulted in positive outcomes.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Vo, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
About half the people testing positive had no symptoms, and all discovered cases were quarantined.
With travel to the commune restricted, this eliminated new infections completely.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has spread much more slowly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions like forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore did start advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after holiday break on 23 March.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has found that countries that have tested more, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Out of 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Asia, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
China is subject to testing in the following chart by % of tests under the test line of any country.
A country that only tests people admitted to hospitals has a higher positive as % of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they are showing symptoms, other things being equal.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Hand washing with soap consistently at the critical moment during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and cholera, which is transmitted through fecal-oral route.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
There are five critical times during the day where washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease: after using the bathroom (urination, defecation), after cleaning a child's bottom (changing nappies), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash.The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a patient.
After changing the diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed them and touch them.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of the virus.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals which can cause harm or diseases.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; decreasing respiratory infections;
and reducing infant mortality rate at home birth deliveries.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices may lead to small improvements in the average growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with hand washing with soap.Hand washing with soap is the most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated together with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, flaky skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health-care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day where washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease: after using the bathroom (urination, defecation), after cleaning a child's bottom (changing nappies), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when handwashing technique should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treating a wound or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of people wash their hands with soap.In 2014, Saudi Arabia found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of hand washing with 97%, the U.S. with an average rate of 77% and the lowest rate of 23%.Several behaviour changes in hand washing with soap are already underway.Hand washing is a group of school children at a time of specific behaviors for children to establish behavior changes in children.
The charity charity was founded by the Department of Education in the Philippines, and is an example of improving children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, combined with washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, is the most important part of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or detergents to water.
The main work of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not readily dissolved in water.
Cleansing is, however, aided by a reasonable flow of water.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may hold bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A small number of studies which have looked at the bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap have concluded transfer is unlikely as the bacteria are rinsed off with the foam.
The CDC also states that a liquid biomarker may be useful in without contact with a correct hand-washing agent.
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to a health-conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains aren't removed by antibacterial soaps, they might not be as effective as they are marketed to be.
In addition to surfactant and skin protective matter, this advanced formula may include acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid and lactose acid) as pH regulator, benzalkonic acid is active with antimicrobial properties and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, minerals, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon Public Health indicated that simple soaps are as effective as anti-bacterial soaps containing a tricolosan, in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands.
Hot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural oils which hold soils and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) into a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen-peroxide increases further the antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ killers.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of the bacteria on hands 1 minute after application.Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.Enough hand antiseptic or alcohol rub must be used to thoroughly wet or cover both hands.
The surface and back of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
Finger tips must be washed well too, rubbing them in both palms.The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing over hand sanitizer rubs, particularly when hands are visibly dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur.
The lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to soap and water hand washing.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not cleanse the hands of organic material, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on the hands.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizer efficacy is heavily dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically has significantly under-performed alcohol and alcohol rubs.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent because in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended ash or sand as alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Correct handwashing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for prevention of transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because standing basins may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference.
Lather hands by rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of hands, between fingers, and under nails.
Soap lifts germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when soap is used rather than water alone.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from skin, and scrubbing for longer periods removes more germs.
Drink well under the water.
Rinsing in a basin can recontaminate hands.
Dry with a clean towel or allow to dry with the air.
Wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminated.The most commonly missed areas include thumbs, wrists, between fingers, and under fingernails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish may harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep the hands from drying out; dry skin can lead to skin damage which can increase the risk for the transmission of infection.
A variety of low-cost options can be used if needed in developing countries to facilitate hand washing where tap-water and/or soap is not available. For example, washing water or soap from a hanging galvanizing or drying with suitable holes and/or using ash. In low-cost water conditions (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are low-cost water consumption solutions, such as glass pipes, and other low-cost options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology using a jug suspended by a rope, and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective drying of the hands is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in public washrooms.
A growing volume of research suggests paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many washrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London and sponsored by the paper-towel industry the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and the jet-air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the warm-air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the finger pads by 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Drying with the jet-air dryer resulted in an increase on average of the total number of bacteria on the finger pads by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average on the finger pads by up to 76% and on the palms by up to 77%.The scientists also carried out tests to establish whether there was the potential for cross contamination of other washroom users and the washroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the machine at claimed speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the device and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of warm-air dryer spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms.In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:
There are a variety of hand dryer manufacturers, and hand driers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Hand washing using hand sanitizing wipes is an alternative during traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand-washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study showed decreased infection rates with their use.
Medical hand-washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together by closing the fingers.
If there is debris and under fingernails, it is best to clean it out of a brush.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to turn off water (and open any exit door if needed).
This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health-care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (Chinese micro-organisms) and avoid transmitting them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that a lack of hand-washing remains at unacceptable levels in most healthcare settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in health-care sectors.
The draft guidance of hand hygiene by the organization can also be found at its website for public comment.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
China’s WHO introduces five locations for washing hands: China
after contact with blood/body fluids
before an aseptic task, and
Before patient care.The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (Chemical or antimicrobial agents) confers killing action to a hand-washing agent.
One such deadly action may be desired before performing surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. To clean the person's hands for surgery, a water tap is required to be dry without touching the hands, opening and closing, a chlorhexidine or humectant-free hand dryer to dry the hands after washing and a sterile brush for scrubbing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the nails.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually two to six minutes.
Long scrub-times (minutes) are not necessary.
When washing the hands, the water on the forearm should not reach the hands again.
After hand-washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is donned.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash the hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after tending to a sick person.
For control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been shown that the main benefit of hand-cleansing came from the first 20% of washing, and that very little additional benefit was gained when hand cleansing frequency was increased beyond 35%.
Washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soap.Comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from hands.Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings can include education for staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rub, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health, and even good nutrition.
However, a lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, at schools and at the workplace make it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behaviors.
For example, in rural Africa hand washing taps close to every private or public toilet are scarce, even though cheap options exist to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates rather can also be the result of engrained habits rather than due to a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavior change of the population.
For effective work, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.One example for hand washing promotion in schools is the three-star follow-up by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps, such as ensuring that students wash their hands with soap, in addition to other healthcare requirements.
When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to ultimately three stars.
Building hand washing stations can be a part of hand washing promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality.
Global Hand washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to achieve behavior change.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relationship to DALYs averted.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly those with vulnerable conditions, such as mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid 19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the pre-Sergender of the pre-Semince Kingdom.
At that time most people believed that infections were caused by foul odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to prevent such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with proper hand washing techniques were hung up next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase “washing one’s hands of something” means declaring one’s unwillingness to take responsibility or share in it.
It originates from the Gospel of Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a wider application in some English communities.
In the wake of Shakespeare's death, Lady Macbeth becomes unconsciously enough to cleanse her hands in an attempt to reveal her conscience about the crimes she committed and forced her husband to commit.
It has also been shown that people, after having recalled or contemplated unethical acts, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to value hand washing equipment more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a contemplation are less likely to engage in other preventative measures, such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe hand washing for both health and symbolic purposes.Symbolic hand washing, using water without soap to wash hands, is part of ritual hand washing, which is a part of ritual hand washing, including Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah, and tilatim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion especially after certain actions advise washing of hands.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate washing of hands after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam mandate washing of hands before and after every meal.
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for hazard controls to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Hazard controls appropriate in the workplace depend on the worksite and job task, based on a risk assessment of sources of exposure, disease severity in the community, and risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers, for which minimum infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-population-density work environments, and some high-volume retail settings.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneeze guards, and having personal protective equipment available in case a person with COVID-19 is encountered.
OSHA considers healthcare and mortuary workers exposed to known or suspected person with COVID-19 to be at high exposure risk, which increases to very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Hazard controls appropriate for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects within the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to becoming sick, needing to care for others, or from fear of possible exposure.
Patterns of commerce can change, both in terms of what goods are demanded, and the means of acquiring these goods (such as shopping at off-peak hours or through delivery or drive-through services).
Lastly, shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted.An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide protective actions.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with various worksites and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors of individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline controls necessary to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or local recommendations.
Objectives for response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people who are at higher risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The disease severity in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
Where COVID-19 hazards cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and lastly personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include the isolation of employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, which can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the hazard to the worker, properly fitted as applicable (e.g., respirators), consistently and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette including covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissues and trash receptacles, preparing for telecommuting or staggered work hours if needed, discouraging workers from using other tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Prompt identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at a worksite.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until they are removed from the fever, symptoms, and any other symptoms, at least 24 hours after the use of fever medications or other symptoms, and that their policy will provide more flexibility in the use of acupuncture to allow employees to stay home to care for the sick family member, and that staff find out these new policies.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are not known or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as those who are in school, cargo work conditions, and some very hard-to-sale spaces. Engineering controls for the group and groups that are at high-risk, including installation of high-efficiency air filters, increasing cost-loss rates, installation of physical barriers, such as spare parts of plastic droplets and installing passenger belts for customer service. Performance controls for these groups and groups include: encouraging patient workers to stay home, to replace meetings with virtually connected, to variable hours, to cancel non-essential travel to where they are facing COVID-19, to provide emergency communication, to handle face-to-risk workers with appropriate precautions, and to protect them from using appropriate face-to-face face-to-care equipment, to protect them from other face-to-care equipment, to avoid contact workers, and to protect them from using appropriate face-to-care equipment, including proper hand-care equipment, to protect them, and to protect their hands-care workers, and maintain them from other face-to-care facilities, such as required to protect them.
Workers in this risk group rarely require respirators.
If a person becomes sick on a plane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others and setting a distance of 6 feet, determining a crew member to serve the sick person and offering a face mask to the sick person and asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when tending to a sick traveler or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include postponing travel when sick, self-isolating, and informing the ship's medical center immediately if the fever or other symptoms are present in the ship.
Ideally, medical follow-up should occur in the isolated person's cabin.For schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean and disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as canceling field trips, assemblies, and other gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, staggering arrival and dismissal times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children who are infected with flu-like symptoms.
When there is substantial transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals should be considered.For law enforcement personnel performing daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low.
Law enforcement officials who must have contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during apprehension, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belt and gear prior to reuse using a household cleaning spray or wipe, and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for containing and laundering clothes.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary workers to be at high or very high categories of exposure risk.
High exposure risk jobs include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-generating procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and exams, or invasive specimen collection.
High exposure risk mortuary jobs include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people who had known or suspected cases of COVID-19 after death; these become very high exposure risk if they perform an autopsy.For these risk groups, additional engineering controls should be considered, including isolation rooms for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, especially when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
In some healthcare and mortuary settings, negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate.
Specimens should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new patients be separated into distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case.OSHA recommends that people who work within 6 feet of patients or suspected of being SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform aerosol-generating procedures on, other personal protective equipment, medical masks.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training, and medical exams.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.The WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only a surgical mask for point-of-entry screening personnel.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that those who collect or receive respiratory samples collected from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, or transporting them from their surgical masks, goggles, protective glasses, face shields, gowns, and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for personal protective equipment through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a COVID-19 patient room for essential work, using only the PPE necessary for the use of a medical mask and not for self-isolation when caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and ultimately encouraging people to use a routine masks without symptoms.

Titleline: [Covid-19] Lightening the load and preparing for the future
SEND DATE/TIME: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENSING: CC0: No rights reserved
We see ourselves in remarkable circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnectedness and our responsibilities to one another.
This challenge is unprecedented, but we know that our best response relies on the sense of empathy, cooperation and social duty that lies at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and care we have seen among all our colleagues over email, calls, and chats is a remarkable validation of the incredible humans we are fortunate enough to work with.
I am very grateful and proud to have colleagues like you.
Last week, someone shared their appreciation for our work with me.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to go to Wikipedia now and what a powerful symbol it is for this critical resource to remain online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you continue to work on sites or our colleagues get their rights or our society is safe.
More than ever, the world needs information that Wikipedia offers.
Now is the moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will create a few significant changes in how we work together this week.
Changing our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, C team members met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In this conversation, we considered things that we thought would be an appropriate response to what we’re facing and the best way to maintain the company’s effective and sustainable efficiency.
We want more than anything to remove stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to call again, no problem.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily working expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We will not announce a holiday - if you are able to work more normal hours, the mission can benefit from your help.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you have to care for loved ones, provide food, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don’t record your time.
If you are sick, don't work.
We don’t need to mention this, but we’re still mentioning it.
No sick days or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If you have tested positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan within T&amp;C Ops know so T&amp;C can help you with support and make sure that management is paying enough attention to your situation).
People who work at an hour will be paid full.
We have already said, and once again we are committed to respect our commitments to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone should pay according to normal working hours in normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to challenge their stress with the world around them.
What we do can be incredibly valuable, especially in times like this.
Again, we’re reminded that this is about your self-care.
Our demand is that you communicate with your manager, so we know what to expect, and we can set ourselves on this basis.
Some work is considered essential.
There are things we must continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may need additional support.
We will begin a process in all units to assess current objectives and focus on supporting what is necessary for this mission.
There’s a lot to do, we’ll just focus on the most important projects.
Slowing right now won’t hurt later.
We do not intend to double the time that this pandemic has ended in order to compensate for prior death.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines which are now unrealistic.
We accept that conditions have changed and will work to set new targets and timelines if needed.
What happens to the APP (Annual Planning)?
To adjust to our new reality and daily working expectations, we intend to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to expand our 2019-2020 plan to save more time and allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care, and care for loved ones, while those who need or wish to work may have a lighter schedule over the next few weeks.
This timeline extension reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the whole organization.
We will offer our proposal to the Board next week and will place representatives and teams within the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership.
Status, Risk and Positioning of Work
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of an abundance of caution, we employed an antiviral cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They utilized a hospital-grade anti-viral solution to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby and elevator banks accessing our floor.
The building is employing its own duty-of-care protocol utilizing products that support the safety of their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be well prepared for our return time.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members.
In the past week, our DC office moved to a fully remote setup in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we are in discussion about leasing a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues experience remote work for the first time.
Our long-term remote colleagues need to know that there may be changes and I need to say a few advice:
Limit the length of meetings to at most one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, think of the division of the meeting and holding it in a few days.
Explain the meeting clearly, have a meeting schedule and send the content that should be read before.
Make video calls with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to a default to facilitate live collaboration and connection.
At every meeting a leader, the person who monitors a conversation related to questions and follows the list of people who speak, and have someone to take notes (or work together to learn).
If you need a comfortable handset, email the technical support section.
Use your wellness reimbursement to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack and talk with your colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team is looking at human resources to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation, providing the guidance of the ergonomics and optical networks.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editathons, until the WHO declares the pandemic to be over.
We let them know that we understand that your request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete the agreed-upon grant activities and that no one would be penalized for having to delay or modify those goals.
In the following week, we will provide additional guidance on Wikimania and other local and subject social conferences.
The general sentiment from around the world seems to be both sadness at the disruption but relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own social activity, Wikimedia and otherwise.
By taking a step forward, the CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our relationship with them.
Staying in touch around COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this opportunity to share additional updates, answer your questions and contact each other.
We're together in this situation, and we're ready to help anyway.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information from this email, and all other essential COVID-19 related information, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information will be stored in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with staff who are more affected by countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workstream, or coverage challenge or any other subject you need to help with, please notify and cooperate quickly.
We are ready to serve to help provide support and connection as needed.
If you are aware of a confidential or sensitive topic, please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be considered as abandoning work and commitments.
Rather, in contrast, they now show that our work and obligations should adapt to a new way that has not been previously experienced.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to support one another so that we can continue to work, support our movement with the support they need, and support the world that depends on it.
Our planned work is waiting for us for the right time.
It’s time for us to support each other and create space for important work that will be coming in the weeks and potentially months ahead.
We need all of you to do so, and so we all want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be at your best when you need it.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Kadine, Part CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, James V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and other members of the Management Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaememen V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE2 counters the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular diseases.ACE2 also serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and ultimately excreted into urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of mainly lung type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counter balance to ACE.
ACE cleaves angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn separates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid transporter from the angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, neurotensin, dianorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane trafficking of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63 (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located within cells.
This entry process also requires priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under current investigation as a potential therapeutic.This has led some to hypothesize that decreasing the levels of ACE2 in cells might help in fighting the infection.
However, multiple professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that using ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in risk of pneumonia compared with controls.
In addition, respiratory disease severity has also decreased in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia related mortality, although the results were less robust than for overall risk of pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is surmised to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with a lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to a 24-hour effect.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated.Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to aid contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying persons (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected individual
Many applications were developed or developed with official government support in some territories and territories.
Several frameworks for building contact tracing apps have been developed.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that work based on tracking the geographical location of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is in use across more than 200 Chinese cities.In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local information technology community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia launched a mobile app called StopKorona! China, based on Bluetooth to trace exposure with potentially infected persons and provide a fast response to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks. A similar app is planned in Ireland and France (OneStopCovid China).
Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if the app is only used for a small fraction of the population.
By paying attention to the spread of misleading or harmful beta-CoVs, China has imposed restrictions on organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, limiting them to only subnational or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners voiced their concern regarding the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, in particular about whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
Organizations announced eight conditions for government projects:
Kirserville must be legally, necessary and proportionate;
extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have sunset clauses;
The use of data would have to be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity should be protected and shown to be protected based on evidence.
digital surveillance would have to avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
There must be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuses;
It will also be required by all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalised groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also issued a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating systems once it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download a program and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data. A number of privacy-preserving systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system gathered tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notices via text messages to potentially-infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made the location information publicly available, something permitted because of far-reaching changes to privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public via a number of apps and websites.Countries including Germany considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details had not yet been released.
Privacy-preserving contact tracing is a well-established concept, with a substantial body of research literature dating back to at least 2013.As of 7 April 2020, over a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a co-ordination effort that includes both centralised and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol.Decentralised protocols include Privacy-preserving Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN), fka contact events, CEN, Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and other things.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching happens on-device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
Lying is based on research from China's whitepaperApps Gone Rogue: Maintaining privacy in the time of the Chinese epidemic that was released in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies that were also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace utilizes secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of this data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was formed by groups that had coalesced around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the goal to reduce fragmentation and enable global interoperability of tracing and alerting apps, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-preserving cryptography.
They also published specifications of the central technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be expanded in three stages:
rollout of tools to enable governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracing apps
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to address the costs of reducing purchase and persistent surveillance initially distributed the system through operating system updates and then removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the repurposing of an approved drug for the treatment of a different disease or medical condition than that for which it was originally developed.
This is a front of scientific research which is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 druggable proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analyzing those binding sites provide the reasonable project of developing effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al studied several candidate compounds which then optimized and analyzed for their skeleton similarity with the highest similar approved drugs in order to accelerate a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development in his preclinical study to be recommended in a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial medication that is also used against some auto-immune diseases.
On 18 March, the WHO announced that chloroquine and the related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March.On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trials process and is authorized as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC has said that the use, dosing, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection have not yet been established.
The founders said that when there was no other option, they used one of the following.
The Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of preventative use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir was of no effect
Of 35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the length of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia half were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is scant and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its stockpile, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to Picasso Picasso Ping Maming Post, Shinzo Abe has made overtures to the Trump administration about purchasing the drug.The drug may be less effective in severe cases of illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
One study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that no benefit was observed in China.
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV from replicating by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that will bind with the protease of SARS-CoV-2.There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to repurposing drugs specifically developed for HIV.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections . Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and corona- viruses .
One issue with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pretrial studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.There are several clinical trials underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with moderate illness and another for those with more severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one with no control (Italy).
New York State began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco Tjin (ciclesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of pre-clinical patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from severe, hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, named COLCORONA, is recruiting 6000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experience mild symptoms not requiring hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is being widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study on 300 patients researching the use of enoxaparin sodium at prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on repurposing approved anti-viral drugs that were developed for prior outbreaks such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially repurposable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Also trials in Italy and China, and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are multiple attempts in progress to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As described in April, CEPI initiative guidelines for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, deployment at scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Major platform targets advanced in Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in planning or being designed).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and at multiple sites, while determining more precise, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and test effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, as well as monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in preclinical testing).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune reaction.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the commencement of work on a vaccine, aiming to start human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the laboratory OncoGen in Romania published an article on the design of a vaccine with similar technology to the one used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and had begun testing.
On 27 February 2020, a Generex subsidiary company, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced they were beginning a vaccine project to develop an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine that could be tested in humans 90 days ago.
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Equipment Centre at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Military Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
Around 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had teamed with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners further announced plans for preclinical testing and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's Health Ministry announced they are working with 11 isolates, and that even on a fast track it would take at least around one-and-a-half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human testing planned for July or August 2020.
Last week, The Guardian reported that the US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac a large amount of money to provide specific access to a COVID-19 vaccine and has faced opposition to the German government.
On 17 March 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, currently in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company announced they will have pre-clinical testing results in April 2020 and their final vaccine candidate could begin human testing by fall.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), announced a US$4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Institute of Pasteur, Meis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing investment in COVID-19 vaccine development to US$29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners for COVID-19 vaccine development are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national vaccine with several new vaccines could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on testing of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that epidemiology of single SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses [in the mice] that were evident 2 weeks after immunization.
On 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA is designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
A further randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enrol 4,170 healthcare workers.
It is possible vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess vaccine efficacy using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicate a need for biosafety-level 3 containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became prevalent, it was believed that existing SARS research may provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a MERS vaccine (DNA based) that completed Phase I clinical trials and other three being conducted, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-MERS-S vector.
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory claiming the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts reference existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is primarily spread between people in close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When these droplets are produced when breathing out, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than moving around long distances.
People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against the use of masks, some recommending it, and others requiring it.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only with chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not all who are infected develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The proportion of infected people who do not display symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Long talking releases more droplets than normal talking.
A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Science has suggested that transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in the hallway outside of people's rooms yielded samples positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolised and thus result in airborne spread.
While there are concerns it may spread via feces, the risk is low.The most contagious condition is when a person has symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for one day on cardboard, for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on 99% copper.
This, however, varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if correctly used; soap products degrade the virus' fatty protective layer, deactivating it, as well as separating the virus from skin and from other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken a median of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day tested.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus binds to ACE2 and entry into the host cell, a special glycoprotein called a spike (spike) glycoprotein.
Acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted in hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms is high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
A high incidence of Traumatosis (31%) and ambulatory (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be related to poor prognosis.Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 show diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so laboratories across the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience with testing has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month.Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Multipolar multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Few data are available about microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of the autopsy include:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organisation of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.
Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is recommended.
To limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals, the CDC has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public settings.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no medication known to be effective at preventing COVID-19.As a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the curve.
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating or after blowing one's nose, coughing or sneezing.
It further recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is not an active substance hand sanitizer.
glycol was added as a humectant.
People are treated with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they carry the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.The WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for taking care of people who are hospitalised with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions must be taken to minimise the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions.The CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended gear is: PPE gown, respirator or facemask, eye protection, and medical gloves.When available, respirators (instead of facemasks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but the FDA has authorised the masks for use under an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect from airborne particles like dust, but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for the use not listed on its labels.
The CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks when masks are not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people in hospital, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
Whether either of these two leads to the same benefit for people who are critically ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer staying with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high flow nasal cannula.Severe cases are most common in older adults (those older than 60 years, and especially those older than 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits a health system's capacity to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalisation.
One study in China found 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support of ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people in hospital with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators capable of pressure control modes and high PEEP are used to maximise oxygen delivery while minimising the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available in older ventilators.
Research into potential treatments started in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears to be the most promising.
Although new medications may take until 2021 to develop, several of the medications being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommended volunteers take part in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted temporary authorisation to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not undergone the clinical trials needed to show it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect closely and therefore a potential risk of infection using surveillance data.
Each user can check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health officials.Big data analytics on cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people whom they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of people supposed to have coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deployed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breakers.
Giulio Gallera, a member of the Italian regional health department, said it was informed by mobile operators that 440% of people would run around anyway.
The German government conducted a 48 hours weekend hackathon with more than 42.000 participants.
Also the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor in saying, \"More social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and an economic downturn are a complete storm to harm people's mental health and wellbeing.\"
The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is not yet available.In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.
Problems related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Clotting abnormalities, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, have been found in 6% of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who present with COVID-19 demonstrate elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five being spent hospitalised.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalisation and death.
In a study of early cases, the median time from exhibiting initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a death rate of 2.8% while women had a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung picture resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was noted by elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.Availability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of a region may also affect mortality.
Estimates of the mortality from these conditions vary because of regional differences, as well as because of methodological difficulties.
The under-counting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past can mean the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.Concerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.
This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown if past infection provides effective and long-term immunity in people who recover from the disease.
The lives of persons confirmed by the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases in which recovery from COVID-19 have also been reported to be associated with other CoVs.
These cases are believed to be worsening of a lingering infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and have an animal origin, through spillover infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.
Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.
In late 2019, the WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without the SARS-CoV-2 infection.The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region.Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.
While not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may show how many people have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) are already dead.
In Gangelt, the virus was spread by Carnival festivals, and spread to younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified as such.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overwhelmed by acceptance and treatment of patients.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as assessed from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
The case fatality rate in men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s and the gap between men and women is only in the 90s.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The main reason for this sex-difference is not known, but genetic and behavioural factors can be a reason for the process.
Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of those died with COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nurses, are women, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be COVID-19 (COVID-19).
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the disease first appeared: 31 December 2019.
The name had been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatisation.The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the World Health Organization is contingency of the general public statements of the COVID-19 virus or the virus that COVID-19 has been identified.
It is commonly referred to as virus or disease spread by the virus.
Early outbreaks in Wuhan, China, and the virus were found to be closely related to the coronavirus and the coronavirus disease in Wuhan.
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease in accordance with 2015 guidance against using locations in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs or ventilator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver it, a local startup reversed with 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation emerged regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and rapidly spread online.
Humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals.
Research failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No medications or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 are underway by government organisations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial to assess treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise of efficacy.
There is no available vaccine, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being utilised because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, be it inactive or dead, aims to elicit a prompt immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the Chinese research, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was in place, as of April 2020.Several existing antiviral medications are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for investigation by other researchers.
Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice that dose is highly dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19.The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
After demonstrating low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, acetase has been recommended for further study within the body.Student studies have shown that initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from embracing these therapies without further study.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing a phase 2 non randomised test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in many infected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised or controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who are currently being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
Production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, could be increased for quicker deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
