The House of Wales is worried that “like the bride of the night’s tent” will be seen.
Among some members of the Parliament, there are concerns about the offer of their title change to the MWP (the importance of the Parliament of Wales).
This concern is due to plans that have been raised to change the name of the Assembly to Pleman Wells.
Members of the House are concerned about all political spectrums that make them laugh.
One of the members of the House of Wales says his group is concerned that “MWP’s with Twp and Pwp’s.
In Wales, Twp is a fool and pwp.
One member of the Plaid Party says that the group is generally not a “absolute” name and has proposed other options.
One member of the Conservative Party of Wales says his group acts on this “unthinkable” change, but it also points to the fact that the MWP’s words are close to the Muppet’s word, “The Night of the Game.”
In this context, the first word of Wells is W like the word u in the English language of Yorksha.
The Parliament Commission, currently drafting the law on change, said: “Of course, the final decision on any topic that members of the Parliament are called is an important issue for their members.”
The 2017 rule of Wales gave the House of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission released the results of a public debate on proposals, in which the name of Parliament Wells was widely supported.
In the case of determining the title for members of the Parliament, the Commission is more likely to be used as a “constitution of the Parliament of Wales” or WMP but has been supported by the MWP option in more general empathy.
House members seem to offer alternative options, but trying to achieve an agreement can be troubled for the head of Allin Jones meetings, as it is expected that the drafting of laws about these changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes regarding how the House works, rules related to the rejection of the authority of the House members and the design of the committee system.
After the parliamentary negotiations, members of the parliament have their final vote on the title they will be called.
The Macedonian people go to the vote for all the change of the country name.
On Sunday, voters will vote whether their country’s name will be changed to “North Macedonia”.
The vote of people in the direction of the invitation to settle a few decades with the neighboring Greek country, one of the provinces of that Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighboring country represents the claim of his territory and has objected to the proposal of the Macedonian membership in the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, was opposed to all the questions and said he would not pay attention to this vote.
However, the fans of all the press, including the Prime Minister of Zurich, believe that this change is a cost name that needs to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
Saint Martin's Church was turned off like the Harlem conflict.
Mr. Adams: “In historical terms, the old men who talked to me about this said there was always a drink and a church in every corner.”
“No one is left today.”
Mr. Adams says it is understandable from the loss of the load.
He said, “Today, people’s society is going to come in a different way.”
“There’s no longer a place where people go regularly.”
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that money comes from the sale of assets until the leaders expect to continue, “to start early or early.”
He adds that the apartment buildings may be replaced by the church, where residents do not help the remaining holy space.
He said: “The fact that the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white and therefore make the day when the churches are closed, for it is unlikely that the majority of those people who move to these apartments will be members of these churches.
Both churches were built a decade before Harlem turned into a black town – the basis of the Metropolitan Association in 1870 and the Martin Church was built by a white congregation.
The White People, who were religious, went away from the city in the 1930s.
The black group, who served near them, considered a new title for the building.
Saint Martin was captured by the black congregation with the leadership of John Howard Johnson's priest. The priest led the sanctions of 125 street shops, which was the main street of purchasing in Harlem, and resisted the hiring or promotion of black men's job.
A firefire hit the building in 1939, but when the city’s inhabitants built the construction plans in Johnson’s father’s neighborhood, a bell set (Carton) also ordered.
David Johnson's priest, the father of Johnson, and his successor in St. Martin, proudly called the bell chain the bees of poor people.
The specialist who examined these bells in July and called it something else: “A cultural treasure” and “a non-regulated historical tool.”
The specialist, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University, also believes it was the first carneon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, and 18 years ago to play a larger carlon in the Riverside Church.
Mr Merriwood believed that St. Martin had not replaced him.
What has been broadcast in St. Martin over the past few months was complex bodies of architects and contractors, some of which were created by the churches of the church and others by the Archbishop church.
In July a letter was written to the Archbishop church and expressed concerns that “the bishop’s church is seeking to pray for its expenses to the room”, although the prayer room was used to hire architects and contractors who were not sent to the bishop church.
Some members of the church complain of lack of transparency from the bishop’s church.
A 13-year-old boy in California was attacked and injured at the time of motif for hunting.
According to authorities on Saturday and the beginning of the shark hunting season in California, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured.
The attack occurred right before 7 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
In an interview with KSWB-TV at San Diego on Saturday, Chad Hamel said that his friends were jealous that after half an hour, he heard the voice of the boy's help and immediately swimming towards him with a group and helped him get out of the water.
He says that at first he thought the boy was excited about being snooped, but then he realized he was crying, \"He got me gas!
\"Don't beat me!\"
He said that when he came to the boy, “the whole moon had been opened.”
He added: “I dared everyone get out of the water, “It’s in the water of the sand.”
The boy was transferred to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was listed in the list of people with critical conditions.
It wasn’t clear what the attacker was from.
Lery Hills, Captain Guard salvation at the media meeting, said that a shark had been discovered a few weeks ago, but it was clear that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Beatles added that the victim was injured and injured in the upper area.
Authorities for the investigation and safety of the authorities banned access to the sea for 48 hours from the Pontto coast in Kasabald to Sumam in Astitas.
Wells was reminded that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not dangerous.
New Zealand Chain Store Designs to log into the UK Cosmetics Market
Keynesbury has risen to compete in a chain store and with the help of specialized assistants in cosmetics with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
As part of a significant effort to enter the cosmetic market is worth 2.8 billion pounds in the UK, which is still growing (while sales of fashion accessories and home products are falling down), the precipitated blocks of cosmetics are being tested across the country in 11 stores and will be created in more stores if successful in the next year.
Investing in cosmetics offered in supermarkets is looking for ways to use shelf space when used for television, microwaves, and household appliances.
Keynesbury said it doubles the supply of cosmetics and brings it up to 3,000 products, which include brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw at the first stage.
The ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with branded places, similar to what is found in stores like boots.
In this supermarket, the cosmetics will be re-opened so that most of the plant products are loved – the subject that is increasingly followed by young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance’s perfume store will also have a unique test in two biogasbine stores, the first store will be opened last week in Krakon, South London, and the second store in Selly Oak, Bamingham late this year.
Online purchases and shifts on the right to buy low amounts of food on local stores daily means that supermarkets are forced to try more than one to convince people to wake up to these stores.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Keynesbury says sales markets are generally more like large chain stores, and supermarkets are trying to meet more services and offer non-invasive materials to fight Aldi and Lidl stores discounts.
New Zealand has created several Argos stores in hundreds of shops, as well as several Habitats stores, because two years ago he bought both chain stores and said it has boosted the sale of food and made the purchase more profitable.
Previous Supermarkets attempt to add cosmetics and pharmacies to fail.
In the beginning of the 2000s, Lizburi tried to create a joint company with Boots, but after a no serious effort, they failed to learn about how to divide revenues in the chemical store and how to cooperate.
The new strategy was taken three years ago when Lizburi sold his 281 pharmaceutical store to Clesio, the owner of the Leeds chain pharmacist to $125 million.
It was said that while adding a wide range of luxury brands in the field of skin care including La Roche-Passay and Vichy in four stores, it would play an important role in this plan.
“In order to improve the environment for our customers, Paul Miles Hicks said, “We’ve changed the appearance and feeling in cosmetic products cages.
We also hired special and trained colleagues who will be there to provide advice.
The range of supermarkets is due to the need and the comfort environment means that we now have a beautiful and guiding place that challenges old shopping methods.”
Peter Jones, after he returned a 11-million-dollar deal, was “scrambled”.
Peter Jones played Dragons Den after the television experiment, Hilbi Wilbby gave him 11 million pounds deal with his brand names and decided to close his new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV with anger.
Wellbey has no time for home clothes and accessories with the brand name Truly.
The business of this couple is similar to the Gwyneth Pettrow’s Goop brand.
On Instagram, Mr. Macy announced that he had left the deal.
Haley Wilbey made him angry with Peter Jones, the Dragons Den, because in the last moment he made a deal with his famous brand – to put his focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Resources say Jones, when the golden hair girl TV TV on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlo, Buckinghamshire, took its new transactions – with value of about 1.5 million pounds – has become angry, meaning he no longer has enough time for the Truly brand, which is active in the field of household clothes and accessories.
The business, known as Gwyneth Pattrow's Goop, is thought to have doubled the wealth of Willubi, which is estimated to be 11 million pounds.
In this way, 37-year-old Willubie on Instagram announced he had been in close contact with Truly, and Jones left Britain to one of his favorite homes.
“Truly really was one of the priorities.
He was going to be a long-term future and will be together in the next few decades.
His decision to cut off everyone’s cooperation completely.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, until the beginning of the work was nothing.
“It’s a store full of goods in the central office of Marlo, who are ready to sell.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of today's \"day\" program, which is one of the UK's most popular stars, can damage millions of dollars due to heavy investment in products including Cosen and Candles to ordinary and home clothes.
This can be the end of a long friend.
Wellbey, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had a close relationship with Jones for 10 years with her wife, Tara Cap.
Welby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and June 52, he worked as a manager of Rics Haat in March.
The two couples were together, and 40% of the shares of the Baldwin TV production company were owned by Jones.
Wellbey wanted to become a M&S business ambassador and replaced Anthony McPatlin, a merchant of the ITV program called \"I'm a Siberian.\"
A source close to Jones last night said, “We won’t comment on his economic affairs.”
It’s difficult to speak “and then we’re in love”.
He did not pay attention to the cash of news media to write that some don’t consider it “the president” and that he did not consider it to be positive about the North Korean leader and he thought it was a joke.
Why does President Trump leave things so soon?
Trump says with a funny voice:
“I haven’t left anything.”
He noted that Kim (North Korea) was released in a second meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June with Trump and that was a big step towards disarming North Korean nuclear weapons.
However, nuclear weapons talks have stopped.
More than three months after the June session in Singapore, Rong Hu, North Korea’s senior diplomats to world leaders at the General Summit in the United Nations said North Korea would not see “insurgent” by the United States in order to advance weapons in North Korea.
He noted that, instead of the United States, the United States has continued to hold pressure to sanctions.
Trump had a great look for his fans.
He said, “Our job was great with North Korea.”
“We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
But now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – ending missile experiments, helping the freedom of hostages and returning the remains of American troops to the country.
And he defended his unusual approach to talk about relations with Kim.
“The president is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people who are trying to move out of this space, we have about 200 people who are standing there.”
Indonesia's tsunami and earthquakes caused a island to be destroyed and killed by hundreds of people.
For example, after the Lumbus earthquake, it was told non-governmental organizations that they didn’t need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lumbu’s population had been homeless, the national disaster announcement that would not be required to accelerate international aid was carried out.
“Unfortunately in many cases, it’s very clear that the demand for international aid is not done and therefore a little hard work.”
While the rescue group of children is gathering a team to travel to the city of Palau, they are still not sure whether foreign employees can work in those areas.
Mr. Sucopo spokesperson of the National Federal Agency said that Indonesia's officials are investigating the situation in Polo to see if they can allow international organizations to help.
Despite the land movements that are constantly happening in Indonesia, it should be said that the country is not very ready to suffer from the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters are built in Ach, there is no news on the other shores of these shelters.
The lack of a logistic alarm on the Palo or even a typical warning was one of the reasons for the occurrence of losses.
In the best case, the move between many Indonesian islands is a challenging task.
Natural disasters make preparations harder.
A hospital ship located in Limbo is on the way to treat earthquake damages, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of the accident.
President Joco and Lido have taken steps to improve his old Indonesian infrastructure, which was the center of his electoral slogans, and has spent a lot of money on the road and railway.
However, the lack of government budgets Mr. Joco's government in the next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also faced with pressure from sectarian conflicts in Indonesia, where the majority of the people who are Muslim have accepted a conservative form of China.
The Christian and Muslim gangs in the streets are killed by the use of cement, bow, and other violent weapons, with more than 1,000 people killed and tens of thousands of homeless.

Karamul statue in the parliament is the oldest memory hit by the \"responsibility of history\"
Its exile is a poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban, many of the British cultural and religious works that were carried out by the proponents of the liberal religion.
But the Kramul Association described Mr. Krick’s offer as “unreal” and “tush to rewrite history.”
John Goldsemite, Chairman of the Kramul Society, said: “Now the debate is inevitable to remove the statues of Oliver Krumol, which are outside the Westminster Palace.
The United Kingdom’s civil war was not a order, nor was it done by Kleul.
Maybe Krumol was victimed against the law and the exchange of the reincarnation of Thomas’s actions in the last century.
The show by William Hamo Torniputt of Karamul is evidence of the 19th century beliefs and part of the history of a personality that many believe is still remarkable.
Mr. Goldemite told Sydney Telegraph: “Clomwell is considered by many people who might have been more than ever in the late 19th century as a defender against foreign pressure.
Whether it’s a completely accurate display, it’s a historical ongoing debate.
What we trust is that the conflict in the mid-19th century formed the next development process of our nation, and Krumol is a well-known character that represents one side of it.
His achievements as a sponsor of Lord also have the value of imagination and memory.”
A killer pig with a poze killed the Chinese farmer.
According to local media, a farmer in the market in the south of China was attacked by a pig and killed.
According to the South China newspaper, the man, who was only identified by the family name of Ivan, while his partners were cut off and blood Sertapa was found near a pigdonian market in Guangzhou.
On May 30, 2005, and in the Saning Province of China, a pig farmer was ready to inject a vaccine into the pig.
According to the report, he entered the city with his uncle son from the neighboring Uonnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his uncle's son realized he was dead and the neighbor's door is open.
He said he was a big pig in the pigeon, which was his mouth blood.
According to the report, the legal medical examination confirms that the pig attacked the farmer with 250 kilograms and caused him to die.
According to the newspaper, the son of a killed boy named \"Wo\" said, \"My cousin's legs were bloodless and broken.\"
The security cameras film shows that Uan is in the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed its pigs on Thursday.
He was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed this man does not belong to the animal or the son of his uncle.
One market manager told the evening newspaper that the pig was closed to prevent attacking people, and the police gathered evidence from the scene at the same time.
It has been reported that the Uan family and market officials are negotiating about his death instincts.
Before that, there were some cases of a pig's attack to humans, although the issue is rare.
In 2016, in Massachusetts, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm and sent a severe injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a pig drove 290 kilos of a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife threatened the animal.
After an Oregani farmer was eaten by its pigs in 2012, a maniatoba farmer told CBC News that they were not normally aggressive, but the taste and taste of blood can act as a mouse.
He said, \"It's just playing.
They get gas and they're very curious... they're not out that they can hurt you.
You just have to respect them as appropriate.”
The survival of the Raza storm resulted in heavy rainfalls in the southern United States.
As it was predicted, the storm was weakened due to the movement of the North Mexico coast’s colder waters.
However, Raza will cause floods in northern Mexico and the southern United States during the coming days.
The Raza storm, which is part of the 1st storm, with a wind of 137 km/h speeding up to 5 a.m., occurred on Sunday, east of the United States and is located 620 km south of the Punta Eugenia of Mexico.
Roza is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressure waves start to form on the ocean and move toward the east and west coast of the United States. By approaching the Raza on Monday, a tropical storm to the Gulf Island, the extreme tropical moisture is headed toward the north of the southern coast of the United States.
Rosa will rain on Monday in parts of Mexico up to 250 mm.
Then the heat moisture in the interaction with low pressure waves in the coming days will cause heavy loads in the south.
Bars of 25 to 100 mm of rain on a surface cause sudden floods, water flow along with waste and possibly ground slips.
High-temperature humidity increases the rate of precipitation in some places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona, up to 50 to 75 mm per hour.
It is expected to rain in parts of the southwest, especially in many areas of Arizona, about 50 to 100 mm.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rains, sudden floods occur, and the situation is rapidly getting worse.
Due to the risk of rainfalls of the province, the court is advised to avoid walking on the road.
Heavy rainfalls cause deep valleys to turn into windy rivers, and the storm will blow wind along with dust.
The waves of China will cause severe local precipitation in parts of the southern coast of California.
Rainfall is more than 12mm, which will cause water flow along with waste and damage of roads.
This will be the first time in the warm season.
The spread of tropical rains occurs in late Sunday and early Monday in Arizona, which will be spread in late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain falls on Tuesday to Four Corners, and it will continue until Wednesday.
In October, we see dramatic changes throughout the United States, as the North Pole cools, but the tropical areas remain completely warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the short intervals.
On Sunday, a great sample of temperature differences will occur in the entire United States Central section.
Almost 20 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City from Missouri State and Omaha from the state of Nebraska and St. Louis and Desperes from the United States of Iowa.
Within a few days, the heat will remain late summer and will rise again.
Many central and eastern parts of the United States are expected to have warm days in early October, and in the south-east parts of the air to 27 °C.
The New York City temperature may reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 6 °C higher than average.
The forecast of weather conditions in the first half of October shows that the risk of higher temperatures is higher than average in the U.S. east.

Philip played a major role in the Friday show.
After the president announced the Middle East that he would vote for Kavan, on Friday the CN and CBS cameras showed him that he was going to the Court of Justice among all oppositions.
He stood for a few minutes with depressed eyes while others blamed him, and the scene was spread alive from CNN.
A woman said, \"I'm standing in front of you.
“Do you think it’s telling the people of the country the truth?
The man said, “When you are a lot of women, you are strong.”
Philip said his office had issued a statement and said that before the elevator was closed, he wanted to say more to the committee at the meeting.
The cable networks and broadcasting programs were covered when the juvenile committee voted to vote for the Cuban candidate at the Senate.
But FBI said he had only done this by understanding that FBI has been supporting minority Democrats for the next week.
Fleley was somewhat convinced after a conversation with his friend Chris Colins, who is a Democratic Senator.
After a conversation with Cocons and several other Senators, Fleley decided.
The election was powerful because it was clear that the Republicans could not give a vote without a vote.

People would go forward, but they had to choose another path.
Narcis Troms, a 68-year-old electricalist and co-authored with his wife in separatist protests, said: “There is no hope that Katalonia’s expectations will be fulfilled in the acquisition of independence.
“We spent the past year one of the best moments of our life.
I witnessed the cry of my parents because they could vote, but now we're stuck to Ben.\"
Despite the management of that vital victory in regional elections in December, Catalan independence parties failed to continue their movement this year, many of their famous leaders are in exile or detention, waiting for the trial to change their role in organizing the regime and declaring independence.
Juan Poyig, a 42-year-old mechanical and film-backed police officer with a phone of demonstrations, said that the difference between politicians has been closed to Ben.
He said, “They are more and more.”
On Saturday, Orwell Jancores, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in temporary detention since the end of the year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections in the next year.
He said, “It’s the best democratic way for the European Parliament’s election candidate to condemn the persecutions and the suppressions we’ve seen from the Spanish government.”
London: During the destruction of a house with a car, a few men were arrested.
Three 33 men, 34, and 39 were arrested after they had taken their car to a London-based house.
The incident took place on Thursday, about 19:30 at the time of Britain in Balingrad Kersten.
Detective Bob Blaming said the damage to the door and the building itself.
In some places, it has been shot by a bow in the car.
Manga with his flower made Giuingston 1 to zero to win the suffering team.
The first Goldie Menga for Pyongston to guarantee the victory of this team
Johnston drove sufferings, and Steven Gerard suffered his second defeat in 18 games as the director of the Club of Oborks.
Gold Dali Manga made Giuingston’s lead to the repercussion of the Hall of the Hibernian.
The Bernard team will not win at the top of the league, and with the Hertz team, which has eight points, will play next Sunday.
Before that, the sufferings will be on Thursday at the European League’s Redone.
Meanwhile, Pyongston with Holt’s coaching coach, who moved in the last month, moved to the six games.
Pyongston lost his chance against his guests.
The team had been aggressive before he reached the flower, and their direct jokes caused suffering.
Scott Robinson defeated the defenders, but his effort to go to the flower was unbearable, and then Alan Gitgoff was only able to turn him back to the flower to go to Craig Hulkett.
The host team was happy to play against the suffering team, and they knew that they could trouble the opposite team in parts of the game.
And so they were able to make it a lifeless flower.
Liwington was released by a blow, the ball came to Manna from the village of Galacher and Robinson, and he also entered the door from the middle of the ball’s fine ground.
Until that point, suffering was owned by the ball, but the defense of the host team was inconvenient, and the lady's door was largely inaccurate.
The process continued in the second half, though Kim Clay was able to control Alfredo Morlos' ball.
Scott Petman was stopped by Alan McGregor, the lady gate of suffering, and Latgoff also hit the outside foot for Pyongston.
The beats of the parties were constantly driven toward the ground of the Giulings, but they were all over. The suffering team claimed twice that a penalized event - once after the hacking error on the player replaced the Golden Midton and one because of the ball's contact with the hand.
\"The Most Wonderful Work\" by Pyongston - Analysis
Alasdair Landont Reporting BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
An excellent performance and result for Pyongston.
I think they were great, they still appeared to be better than expected in this path.
Their game style and people have changed very little after they return to Oja, but the main pride is that Holt has taken it off after entering the team.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Hartley was great and organized the defense very well, while Monaga was able to fail Quir Nor Golds and Joe Vervalal.
Even though the team didn’t bother.
As they were good at the time, they are now far from those standards.
They didn’t have a final player – they could only open the host team once – and that’s a warning for the sufferings that are now in the middle of the table.
The second welcome from Erdogan in the U.S.
On Saturday (29 September) Turkish and German leaders met with smiles in the Blue Sky Berlin.
This is the last day of the meeting of President Erdogan of Germany, which aims to reform relations with NATO allies.
They negotiated on human rights issues, press freedom, and Turkish membership in the EU.
Erdogan then went to Calon to open a new and large mosque.
The city has replaced the largest Turkish population outside the country.
The police prevented the security reasons for the gathering of a population of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but a large number of fans came together near the mosque to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents against Erdogan – many of whom – began to argue, and the Afghan policies and the German government’s decision to accept him in the country.
The demonstrations of two groups against each other indicate that the fall between the two groups of German Turks, who recognize some Erdogan as a hero, and others call him NASA as a dominant ruler.

The threat of sudden flooding by the storm of Raza in the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Celtie City (the dry surface may be made of rain).
It’s a rare thing to reduce the static pressure to Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen in the early next week, which means that the remaining energy of the Raza storm from the south of the past, and the risk of sudden flooding will occur.
National Weather Service for Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona to South and east of Nevada, South East California and Utah, including Phoenix, Florida, Las Vegas, and Saltley City, has predicted a sudden flooding event.
It is anticipated that Rosa turned his route to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in late Monday it will cause rain to rain there.
The National Meteorological Service at Fontyx through a balleric message noted that “from 1950, only ten tropical storms have caused static storms or low pressure conditions of about 320 km of Phoenix!
The Hurricane Katrina (1976) was a storm at a distance of 65 km across the state of Arizona.
The latest models of the National Center have predicted that it rains 50 to 100 mm, which also occurs in Mogollon Rim Rysona to 150 mm.
In other areas of the south-west desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Waterfall Pool, it is likely that it will rain 25 to 50 mm of rain, which may be as high as 100 mm.
For areas that are far away from the dangers of sudden flooding, the rain of raza may benefit because these areas suffer from drought.
Although flooding is very serious, it will probably be useful for some areas of these precipitation, as the south-west region is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to Weather.com, over 40% of Arizona regions are in severe drought conditions, with the second most severe.
At first, the route of the Raza storm to the island of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, still has a storm, and on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, 620 km from southern Punta Eugenia Mexico, is moving north by 20 miles per hour.
The storm continues to face colder waters in the Pacific and therefore shrinks from its power.
Therefore, it is expected to show its power at night or at night in Mexico.
Loading in different parts of Mexico can be severe and the risk of flooding is significant.
“All the rains from California to North America are 75 to 150 mm, which may reach 150 mm.”
Rosa then moved from Mexico to the north in a warm storm, and in the early morning, on Tuesday, the low-pressure region reaches the Arizona border, and in late Tuesday, she will move to the south of Utah.
According to the National Center for Storm: “The main risk predicted from the reza and its survival includes very severe precipitations in California, North West Sudan, and the southern desert of the United States.”
These rains are expected to cause sudden floods and threatening life in the desert and the fall of the earth in the mountains.
The attack on Ms. Norton: four suspects were arrested for murder.

Trump says Kavian is upset by the “press and anger” of the Democratic Party.
In his speech, Trump said in West Virginia, \"As a judge, Kavian is a vote to reject the unjust and unjust tactics of the Democratic Party.
Trump says Kiano was upset during his candidate process for the election of the Democratic Party.
Kaveano announced on Thursday that he strongly denied the claim of Christine Blad, who claimed to have been raped for decades before the Congress session.
Ford also testified about his claim at the meeting.
President Trump said on Saturday that “people of the United States saw the story and quality and courage” of Kaveano on that day.

Hundreds of people were killed in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and it seems to increase losses.
On Saturday, officials said it had been killed at least 384 people on the coast of many people by earthquakes and large tsunamis in Indonesia.
On Friday, hundreds of people were gathered to attend a festival on the coast of Palo, which suddenly took a large number when the waves were going up to six meters (18 feet) and drowned them and destroyed everything that was on its way.
The tsunami occurred under an earthquake with a intensity of 7.5 beards.
Sutopo Purwo Nougroho, a spokesperson for the Indonesian disaster reduction organization (BNPB) at a press meeting in Jakarta, said: “A day when the tsunami threat occurred, people didn’t stop working on the beach and immediately fled and were sacrificed.”
He said: “The company that came to the cars, roads, and houses and destroyed everything on Earth, added that the tsunami moves at sea at speeds 800 km/h (497 mph) before it reaches the coastline.
He said that some of the people went through the trees to escape from Solomon and lived.
About 1,600 people were evacuated from their homes and given them in 24 locations in Palau.
Air photos published by the National Federation show that many buildings and stores have been destroyed, mapped together, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the earthquakes continued in the coastal city.
This was one of the earthquakes in a region with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by the massive earthquake was about 200 times the nuclear bomb in World War II.
It is said that the city’s geography, which is at the end of a narrow and long bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nogroo described the damage as a “determination”, saying thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotel were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found while the walls of the destroyed buildings were destroyed, and more than 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nogrove said the damage and damage during the coastline of 300 km north of Palau, a region called Daanga and near the centre of the earthquake may be more likely to be.
He said, “The communications are “completely cut off and there is no information” in Daugala.
In a statement, the Red Cross said that more than 300 thousand people live there, and the employees and volunteers of the organization have been sent to the regions.
“It’s a disaster, but it could be much worse than that.”
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday because it did not notice that the tsunami was approaching Paul, but officials announced that the waves had reached the beach when the warning was issued.
In the amateur films shared in social media, a man's voice is heard in the top floor of a building that gives the sofa to people who are on the lower street of the building.
Within a few minutes, the walls of the water came to the beach and took the buildings and cars with them.
The Reuters news reporter could not immediately confirm the film's health.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in power cuts and communications around Palo, and faced the work of authorities to coordinate the rescue operation.
The authorities said that the military was taking action by cargo planes to send aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the homeless still need severe food and other basic melodies.
The city airport is only open to aid relief efforts and is closed for other cases to October.
President Joko and Lido visited Skan centers on Sunday in Polo.
The number of victims in Indonesia increased to more than 800.
Things are very bad.
Doseba said that World Vision employees from Doseba announced the situation of the city of Palo safely, in this city, employees installed tent shelters in the district of their office and placed them during the devastating scenes.
He said, \"They said that many houses are destroyed.\"
Things are very bad.
While the relief groups have started their move to reduce disaster with the help of the available tools, some complain that it would prevent the use of foreign aid forces with high specialization to Palo.
According to Indonesia’s regulations, funding, resources, and human resources from abroad are only possible to be declared in the region of national disaster.
But the announcement hasn’t happened yet.
Aloya Arriani, a spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross, said: “This event is still a disaster on the province level.”
“When the government accepts it, it can be declared a national disaster. In this case the path is opened for international aid, but there is no such situation.”
Despite two nights of earthquakes and tsunami in Palau, friends and family of those who have lost hope that a miracle will happen to their loved ones and change the story of this natural grief.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the trash.
On Sunday, the relief forces rescued a woman who had stuck under the wall and had spent two days next to her mother’s body.
Gandon Sobandon is a national team coach of Paragiander Indonesia, a coach of two athletes of Paraglyde, who had been trained for Asian games. The tournament ended in Indonesia early this month.
Other people who were taken to the hotel included Mr. Manggie and his students.
He said, “As a senior coach in Paraglider’s field, I bear a lot of emotional pressure.”
Mr. Gandon tweeted that several hours after the news of the destruction of the Abu Dhabi Hotel has been concerned with his disciples and sent messages to the Paragiader Association through Watsap to the present rivals at the Palao Beach Festival.
However, his messages instead of a pair of blue tick marks only received a gray tick sign.
He said, “I think the gray tick meant that the messages were not delivered.”
The thieves stole $26,750 during the transfer of money to a self-employment device in Singapore.

Kevin West: The rap singer who changed his name to Ye
The singer Reckon West changed his name to Ye.
He announced this change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote, \"My official name is West.\"
Sixty-year-old West, known as Ye's admiration, has used the term \"8\" for its eighth album, which is released in June.
This change was announced before he appeared in the show on Saturday night, where he announced he would soon make his new album, Yandhi.
The producer announced that the replacement of Aryana Grande was the previous reader who had canceled it to “feeling style”.
Yes is the current professional name of the word, and he says that the word is important to him.
Earlier this year, West said in an interview with a large boy radio program on his album: “I believe it’s a word that’s most used in the Bible that means you.
\"I am the one who says, 'I am yours, I am mys, and for us.'
Your name, which means I change only to Ye to make a difference of good, evil and good, and everything.
It’s more than a reflection we’re.”
He is one of the few rap singers who changed his name.
For example, Sean Combs is known as Puff Dady, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but in the following year, he announced that he was more interested in love and brother Love.
The former member of West, JAY-Z is also known as either with or without dark line or large or small letters.
AMLO (The President of Mexico) has promised not to use the military against civilians.
Andres Manuel Leupz Obrador, the president of Mexico’s elected president, at the same time as the 50th anniversary of the massacre of the general Muslim students, promised that they would never use military force against civilians.
Louise Obrador said on Saturday at Tlatelolco’s Palace, “Never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
During the peaceful demonstrations held on October 2, 1968, when the left student movements were growing across Latin America, the soldiers were set to fire on the people.
Louise Obrador has been committed to supporting Mexican youth by giving monthly subsidies to those who are studying and opening government universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities can lead young people to conflicting groups.
The United States should double the financial resources of artificial intelligence (AI).
Cao Fubi, an investor and active AI working in Google, Microsoft, and Apple, said: “According to one who has become more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the investment for research in this field.
These comments were later announced that different parts of the U.S. government published statements on AI, and that the United States generally lacked a formal strategy on AI.
While China announced its plan last year: their goal is to be in the first category of AI innovations by 2030.
“It will be a good start to double AI research budget, considering that other countries are far away from the United States, and we’re looking for the next progress in AI.”
In an interview with CNBC this week, China said that double investment could double the chance of being AI successful in the future of the United States.
The author of the book \"The Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the Global New Order\", published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month. He is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China called Face++.
He worked on an AI system in the 1980s at Carnegie Mello University, which was able to defeat the Othello game champion in the United States. He later became Microsoft CEO and CEO of Google's Board.
One of the technological competitions held in the previous U.S. government, such as the robotic challenge conducted by the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the hope of such things is similar in the future to help understand the next dreams.
Researchers in the United States often work hard to get government aids.
He said, “It’s not enough that researchers have done a university of their own, but these are the companies that do it.”
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies in recent years have hired academic staffs to work on AI.
The change in immigration policies can also help the United States strengthen their efforts in AI.
He says that I think people with PhD in AI should automatically be given to them Green Card.
China's State Council released its next generation artificial intelligence development program in July 2017.
According to China's National Institute of Natural Sciences, it helps individuals in academic institutions who do something similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations for US researchers, but the quality of scientific work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a joint artificial intelligence center that aims to build cooperation between industry and university, and the White House also announced the formation of the Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a plan called AI Next.
And in the case of NSF, it has now invested more than $100 million in AI research.
However, the U.S. law, which was seeking to create a national security commission in the field of artificial intelligence, has not done much in the past few months.
In one question, the Macedonian people say they want to change their country name or China.
On Sunday, Macedonia's people have participated in a meeting and vote on the change of their country's name to \"North Macedonia\", a move that leads to a few decades of conflict with Greece because this has prevented the country's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, known as Macedonia, claims that its North neighbor’s name is a form of claim on the territory of the country and has made the entry of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on the new name offered in June, but the nationalist opponents believe that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he won’t vote on every question, and the ban on all of this question raised doubts whether the number of voters would need at least 50% to be authentic.
The question written on voting leaves is, “Do you agree with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece and membership in NATO and the EU?”
Supports of the name change, including the Prime Minister Zarman Zayev, believe that the cost should be paid by the Macedonia that is one of the countries in the collapse of Yugoslavia, so that it can enter the European Union and NATO body.
“Aliura Georgioska 79, who lives in Skype, said, ‘I’ve come here today to vote for the country’s future, for the Mexican youth to live freely under the European Union, because our lives will be safer.’
The members of the parliament have announced enough that they are going to adhere to the result of the election, although it is not legally necessary.
The name change requires a majority of two-thirds of the parliament.
The Provincial Election Commission has announced that by 1:00 p.m., there were no reports of violations of the laws.
However, the number of participants in the survey did not exceed 16 percent, while in the recent elections in 2016, about 66 percent of the registered voters participated in the election.
Jozi Tanuksky, 62 years old, said one of the voters in the capital, “I voted for my children’s sake, is Europe’s place.”
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, H. H. H.E., and his son, Dasko, launched their vote on September 30, 2018 in Sturmica, Macedonia, to return to NATO and the European Union to join the country.
In front of the parliament in Scosia, Vladimir Durdarkov, 54, prepares a small ski and puts chairs in front of the tents that are set up by the perpetrators of the press.
“We belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with pride, not through the door.”
“We are a poor country, but we have a home.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go back to others like China and Russia and become part of an integrated European and Asian society.”
Prime Minister Zaif said the membership in NATO has a lot of investment, and for a country whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that most people are fans of this because more than 80 percent of our citizens want the EU and NATO.”
He said, “Yes, it will be a confirmation of our future.”
A survey published by the Macedonia Policy Research Institute last Monday found that between 30 and 43 percent of the conditions will participate in all questions – that’s less likely.
Another survey conducted by TV TV TV shows that 57 percent of respondents are going to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote.
To be successful all questions, the amount of a 50 percent is required in addition to a vote.
Failure in every question is the first serious blow to Western pro-government policies that reached power in the last year.
Watch: Sergio Agoreno is a Manchester City player, among all the peoples of defence for you past and the ball.
Sergio Agoreno and H.S. Stingling, on Monday at the British Manchester Stadium, gave me the defense of the Botton to win the game with the result of 2 zero.
Agorero defeated the ball in 65 minutes like watering the ball.
At the beginning of the start, the Argentine invader received a passage in the middle line.
He went through three defenders and opened the space for himself.
Then he found himself surrounded by four green players.
He drew the defense around with his movements on the edge of the field.
Then he turned to his left, and came to Austerling.
The English Fordard retouched the ball at the entrance of the base again, and he hit the ball with his right foot and hit the bank door to the right side of the gate.
Pep Goodiola, the team manager of the Citizen, told reporters, “Aguuro is involved with certain problems in his feet.”
“We talked about him playing 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to produce a flower at the same time.”
But Strilling was the first to flower in this Premier League competition for the celestial waters.
This flower was played in 29 minutes.
Agorero received the ball in that game at the depth of the Earth for you.
He brought the ball to him from the left to the right side of Lori Sin.
Before Strilling went to Trick Dorter, Sin hit the ball several times.
Fortard put the blues right in the ball gate in the mouth of the ball.
City is one of the series of Champions League games at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena City in Sinheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play as Sapphirer in front of the Rockies team
Although the Nationals team has been removed from polyfic competitions, they don’t have a lot of reason to try to get another start.
But the team is always hoping to win the game against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if it has the concept of a polyfolio for Rockies, which has a more game than Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
Rykins won 5 to 2 fronts of the Nationals at least one card, but they still want to have their first title.
“As we play for nothing, at least we can touch the ball, by knowing what Joe is here with the crowd, and the other team will probably play at the highest level we’ve ever met.
Why don’t I participate in that race?”
The Nationals team must announce a star for Sunday game, but it has been reported that they are willing to put Scherzer in the post.
Scherzer, who can start in 34min, has a launch training session on Thursday and normal rest on Sunday.
The right-hand player statistics are: 18-77 with 2,53 ERA and 300 hit at 2,20 3.3 times in this season.
Trump's Talks in Western Virginia
Trump's President Tel Avivly spoke to the situation that lies around the Supreme Court and Bert Kaveano, as well as the importance of the participation of Republicans in the midterm elections.
“We will be gambling all our achievements in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
“This election is one of the biggest and big – I’m not a candidate in this election, but I’m in fact, because I’m fighting for candidates here.”
Trump continued: “You see this terrible group, this terrible democracies, you see that these things are happening now.
They are determined to gain power by using any device that needs to be achieved, you will see these and the unclean post of this group.
“They don’t care who hurt in this farm, who side by side to reach power and control, that’s what they want: power and control, but we don’t want to give them both.”
“The Democrats mission is to build resistance and prevent the chip.”
He said, \"And you will see how angry, in the past four days, the Democrats, the post, the inaccurate, the wrong.\"
He pointed to the Senate Committee of the Senate and Democrat Deyan Feininian Committee of the Senate, who had heard of how they had heard him.
“Do you remember his answer?
Have you read the documents you have made outside?
Wow, whoa.
“No, no, I’m waiting – the body language that was really bad – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
Of those who represent freedom of speech, this is not tolerated.
I was not surprised when the activists at the local party voted critical to me.
However, I was the last person on the line of the Labour Party representatives who did not welcome it - everyone because of the freedom of speech.
Xuan Ryan, my parliamentary colleague, had seen a similar behavior, because he was very opposed to anti-Virtivity.
In my case, criticism of me for the opposition to Corbin's crime.
In terms of the importance of the policy to the economy, about national security, in terms of Europe, there are similar issues where crime was different from previous leaders.
In the news of the meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East on Friday, it was announced that “we want to be comprehensive and productive meetings.”
In eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party, GC meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, today, this tone is not seen in many meetings, and the promise of the policy of \"smoother and smoother\" has been forgotten for a long time.
It is seen that different perspectives are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and the opinions are judged whether it is acceptable to lead the party.
This short-term phenomenon began after he became a leader, when I previously thought I shared a similar political theory with his colleagues, thinking I wanted to cut them off and about the national security or the European Union’s free market that I had never agreed with.
Whenever I speak publicly -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- it's a serious talk about the abuse of social media, which they want to not be elected, condemning the central policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the labor party.
And that hasn’t just happened to me.
In fact, I know that I’m more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments they make about me are political.
I’m exposed to professionalism and determination of colleagues who face sexual abuse or racism every day, but are not ashamed.
One of the sad aspects of this policy is that abuse has become natural to a certain level.
Jeremy Kerbin said last week that the Labour Party should develop the culture of bearing other words.
The reality is that we are no longer a vast church and are more limited by any movement caused by the “reliable sense of self-confidence” or changing the rules of choice.
Over the past two years, I have had a lot of advice that makes me want to say yes, I don’t have a word to say, and just say very good.
But that’s not what I entered politics to do.
I joined the Labour Party for 32 years ago as a school student, which was due to the encouragement of the Tacher government. This made me lose high school classrooms officially, and I was trying to provide better public services for those who need it – it didn’t matter whether I became a member of the Council or a government minister.
I never hid my policy, including in the past election.
No one in the East is confused about the political and metropolitan areas that I have with the current leadership.
To those who encouraged this move on Friday, I can only say that when the country is struggling to move towards Brexit that damages our families, businesses, and public services, I don’t want to waste time and energy on loyalty to the Leader of the Labour Party.
But really one of my messages that has not come to Nattingham, and to members of the House, including the Labour Party or so, is: I am proud to serve you and promise that there is no threat to my lack of choice or political interests from what I believe is good for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr failed to go to the top
The attempt at the last two stages may change to some extent the final result, but there is no doubt that Irre was worthy of this fantastic and interesting victory in the Ragg Lee Tent League.
They are now at the top of the table and the only team on the one side has not yet gone.
Finally, this was their superior defense, and the chance to get the host team and the coach Peter Morechi had the right to be satisfied.
He said, “We have been tested during the competition and we haven’t failed yet, so we have to be happy.”
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Responsibly, they used their chance better than us.”
Grant Andrewson's attempt was completed in a minute by Friedi Klemo, and he woke up, but a yellow card for Captain Scotland, Ray Hughes, was given for the game by Warriors, and Jason Bogot didn't take an unworked effort.
Klemo took the leading player with a pental hit, and before that, right in the half of the game, Glei, then with the individual bus, the result resulted in 17 to 5 benefits.
But Meros started the second half, and the effort of Patrick Anderson reduced the difference with the bus to five points.
After a severe damage to Ruaridh Knott, the game was long halted, after the start of the re-opening, through the attempt of McDoval’s stifling, by the Claymo Pass, Irro re-existed the distance.
After that, Blair MacPuron took a yellow card captain, and again Mr. Morros changed the efforts of Bruce Colon at the end of a severe pressure of another player.
However, the host team returned to the game again, and when Styrofoam Hinchinson took the Tilton on a yellow card without a ball, McChoron fell behind the attacking group of Ier Tach.
Klemo gave a quick pass, like what he had just begun, after Kyle re-opened the ball into David Armstrong’s campus, and the player removed the art player from the fifth host area.
Still Game is looking for a new professional in the restaurant industry.
After it became clear that Ford Cayran is acting Still Game as the manager of a allowed restaurant to move to the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old man took the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who was writing, who worked with Greg Hamfield for some time as a comedy couple.
The two have said that the next series, which is the ninth one, will be the last set of this show, and it seems that New Zealand is planning for its life.
According to official registration lists, he will be limited by the director of Adremitt.
The actor was not present to explain, though the Sun Scottish said that Gernan was looking for a trade of protractors in Glasgow.
The Sea for Us: Bolivia, who has no way to any sea, hopes the court will open a way to the Pacific Ocean.
They protect the sea force from the sea station in Lapar.
In public buildings, the flag of the blue ocean has come to hytzsa.
On sea bases from the Lake Titsica to Amazon, the slogan: “The sea is our right.
“To bring it back is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, which has no sea, the memory of losing the beach line and delivery of it to Chile that led to a bloody war in the 19th century is still alive – like passion for sailing in the Pacific Ocean.
After a few decades, these hopes have reached its highest limit, as Bolivia, after five years of enthusiasm in court, waiting for an international court judgment on October 1st.
Roberto Calzadia of the Bolivian diplomats said, “Bolivi is moving, the spirit of unity and peace is ruling, and, of course, waiting for positive results.”
Many Bolivian people across the country watch the ICJ declaration on large screen pages, hoping that the Laah court would vote after a few decades of negotiation - in favor of Bolivia’s claim and force Chile to sit at the table on Bolivia’s rule and access to the sea.
Ove Morals, President of the Caribbean and Native Bollywood – who has a hard fight for the next year to re-election – on Monday’s orders are very strong.
In late August, he promised, “We’re going to get back to the Pacific Ocean soon.”
But some analysts believe that the court seems unlikely to decide for the benefit of Bolivia – and that if he gets married, it will be a little change.
The United Nations Court, which is located in the Netherlands, has no authority to grant part of the Chilean land, and stressed that the vote could not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
Paz Zarate, an international law expert in Chile, said that the ICJ court’s judgment was only six months after they heard the arguments, which indicates that the case is “not a secret.”
And far away from Bolivia’s extra conflicts, the last four years may restore it.
Zárate said, “The sea-accession has been abused by the current Bolivian government.”
He believes that the adventures of Morals have led to the loss of Hassan Lee Shili.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss some points, but after that, it will continue to be very difficult to discuss and discuss.
Two countries have no ambassadors in the country since 1962.
Former President Edward Rodriguez Vulz, the Bollywood representative at La Hague, rejected the idea that the decision to decide the court had an unusual speed.
He said that Bollywood would have a great “time to start a new era of relationship with Chile” and would have an opportunity to end the 139-year-old conflict on mutual interests.
Calzadella also made the point that Morals – still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America – use a sea theme as a political agent for its benefit.
He said, “Bulley will never go away from his right to access the Pacific Ocean.”
“This is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says it's not a nuclear weapon unless the country can trust the United States.
North Korea’s foreign minister Ray Yong Hu says that until the country can’t trust Washington, it will never destroy its nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, Ray said this in the UN General Assembly.
He asked the U.S. to be a follower of promises given to the two countries during the summit in Singapore.
The statement refers to the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, which seems to be soon to begin negotiations with the negotiations that had been conducted in Singapore for more than three months before, with Kim Jong Yuong, the North Korean leader on nuclear diplomacy.
Rey says that the continuing sanctions and protests of the United States to declare the end of the Korean war would cause North Korea to fall to the knees of “no lack of access”.
Washington operates very carefully until Pyongyang has no serious movement in the right direction of the disarming deal.
Kim and President Trump both wanted to meet the second meeting.
But if Pyongyang is serious about removing nuclear arsenals that are likely to be the only way to ensure the security of this country, there is widespread doubt.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang for the next month to prepare the second meeting of the leaders between Kim and Trump.
Paris’s fashion shows the latest line of huge hats on the “Secrets” route near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely prevent sunlight, you don’t have to be too much.
Valentino and Tom Brown, who are fashion designer, offered a very large hat for the SS19 set, which fills the design style in Paris’s fashion week.
The non-functional hats filled Instagram in the summer of summer, and the designers put their eye-catching creatives in sight.
The plan was decorated by Valentino was a bog hat on the top, decorated with a glossy edge that would cover the head of the model ladies.
Other items that were very large included decorative mirrors, magical hats, and even a panas, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks that are only used in Halloween time.
Many of these colorful masks cover the lips, and most of them were reminded by Hane Luster to design clothes.
One of the plans was similar to the giant hat that was associated with the breathing tube and the swimming glasses, and another design was water-filled like ice cream.
And if you can get these strange hats and look at you all, then you’re lucky.
Light observers predict that these large hats can open their way to the Chinese store near you.
The outer hats are seen on the back of the \"La Bomba\", with the width of 60 centimeters that are seen on the head of people such as Rahana to Emily Rajkovsky.
The intellectual school label, which was spread behind very non-functional hats scattered across social media, sent a great creativity in the neighborhood of Fash - a beach socket of elites, which is almost the size of the Maio Shena model that carries it.
The burned orange blush with dark edges that have a white leather handle, was the main design in the Jacquemus series ‘La Riviera SS19 in the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a well-known fashion expert, told FEMAIL: “These big hats and the next summer beach boots are expected to be put in Chinese stores – since the designer has made such a huge impact, so the demand of large accessories cannot be ignored.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens in the global world.
The independent schools of Scotland have a high level of education and in 2018 continued with excellent results in the exam, which is strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sports, arts, music and other social affairs of society.
These schools, with more than 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Independent School Council (SCIS), try to provide the best services to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for graduate and higher education, elective jobs and their place as citizens in the global field.
As a training sector that can design and run a custom training program, we see that modern languages still exist as a favorite subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that understands, your words enter his mind.
If you talk to him in your own language, you will enter your heart.”
It’s an important point that we can’t rely only on English to create relationships and trust with other people.
From the results of this year’s exam, we can see that foreign languages are at the top of the League table with the highest level of acceptance in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying in foreign languages received a higher A degree.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member school shows that 72 percent of students who study in the Chinese language in Mandarin learned a higher degree A, as well as 72 percent of those studying in German, 69% of those studying in French and 63% of those studying in Spanish received a higher degree A.
These statistics show that independent schools in Scotland know foreign languages as a vital skill for children and teenagers who will undoubtedly need it in the future.
Currently, foreign languages are taken and taught as a lesson, as is the same as STEM Lesson (UV, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in independent schools curriculum and in other places.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the needs of employers, 17 percent related to the lack of language skills in the collection.
Therefore, the importance of language skills is to prepare young people for future careers more and more.
Considering the future job opportunities they need to speak, you can see how much of these skills are needed in the world.
Regardless of the profession that the person chooses, if the second language is learned, in the future it will have a real advantage that a life can use.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners automatically puts a few languages ahead of competitors.
According to your Gov survey, over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom and in 2013, 75 percent of people are not able to speak a foreign language, and France is the only language they have, 15 percent of people can speak this language.
This is why investing in language training is important for children today.
Knowing different languages, especially in the language of developing countries, increases the chances of children to find the right job.
Inside Scotland, different schools teach different languages.
A number of schools focus on classical modern languages, while others teach other languages that will be more important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
It doesn’t matter which language you are interested in, however, there are several languages to choose in schools, and training workers who are experts in this field are also available.
Scottish independent schools are moving to provide a learning environment to prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed in the future.
Today in a global business environment, it cannot deny the vital importance of foreign languages in the future of the country, so it should be included in education and education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as “international communication efforts”.
In independent schools, there is still the right to choose, diversity, and excellence to children in Scotland.
It must be done (in French)
John Edward is the president of the Scottish independent school council.
Leburn plays on Sunday in San Diego for the first time for Tim Leisers.
The expectations for the fans who want to see Lubburn James for the first time in the Los Angeles Tower.
Luke Walton said that James would play in the opening competition on Saturday against Don Nagtz in San Diego.
But it’s a few minutes to play, yet it’s not clear.
Walton said on the official website, “This time will be more than one and less than 48 minutes.
Mike Trudel, a New Jersey journalist, said he would probably play for a limited time.
After practicing earlier this week, James was asked to organize his plans for the first six season games.
He said, “In this course of his career, I don’t need season games to get ready.
Trump's Election Meeting Time in Western Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Trump begins a series of elections in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This is the first gathering of five Trump scheduled meetings in the following week, which includes stopping in the Tennessee and Mississippi regions that are politically agreed by Trump.
Trump, with a confirmation of his choice to fill the throne of the Supreme Court, plans to draw their support for the next election, because Republicans in November are at risk of losing the control of Congress.
When will Trump’s election meeting be held in Western Virginia and how can it be watched online?
Trump's election meeting in Wheeling and Western Virginia has been scheduled for 7 tonight at ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election meeting in Western Virginia online in one of the most live YouTube broadcasts.
Trump will probably refer to the meeting of the Supreme Court Court's Court Bret Kavanaugh that had been arrested by claims about his sexual abuse and was delayed by the Senate's approval vote for a week to perform FBI investigations.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help Republicans and strengthen them in November elections.
Thus, according to President Trump's campaign, the Trump campaign spokesperson said that the five elections will be held in the next week with the goal of “improvementing volunteers and supporters because the Republicans want to protect and develop the majority of the people in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
A spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want his name to be revealed, said Reuters, \"The Congress is so important in the President's work plan that he will travel to any state that might be, because we're entering a busy season of campaigning.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight's election gathering scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling can also collect supporters from the \"Woy and Pennsylvania\" and cover the Pittsburgh Media.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump will visit Western Virginia, the same state that won in 2016 with more than 40 percent of Ara.
Trump is trying to help the Republican and Western Virginia candidate for Senate, Mr. Patrick Morrisi, who is back in surveys.
According to Reuters, Simon Heder, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, said: “This is not a good sign for Morrisi, who has been forced to come here to help him improve his position in polls.”
The Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows its determination to fight and keep hope to enter Sunday solo tournaments.
After three chapters of one side, four-person golf games on Saturday can be the same thing that the Ryder Cup needs.
Awang’s movements are a completely creative exercise concept, but players really believe it, and in similar competitors it has never been more than it has ever been.
So they say where is the move now?
Jordan Spieth, while walking all day, said: “They had six points, and now they got four points, so I think we’re doing it with a little move.
Of course, Europe is superior, there are four front points, and there are 12 other games.
As Americans say, however, they feel that they have little to move and have a lot of things that can be nice to them, especially on the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played the whole day with each other, and each, by taking three points of four points.
Spieth's movements from Ti to Green have been great, and a pattern is considered for the rest.
As he continued to play, the joy sounds were higher, he could put a vital path into the hole and add the race to four points when he and Thomas were two points behind two.
Paul, who won the race for them in 15 years, joined a similar voice, a kind of shouting he told you he believed the U.S. team would not be removed.
She said, “You really have to work hard and worry about your competition.”
It’s all that each of these players has left now.
18 holes to do something great.
The only players who were able to score more than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the legends of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but impressive couple of Europeans, four points from four possible points and offered a perfect job.
\"Moliwood\" was the only couple who didn't just smell in the Saturday evening, but on Saturday, Friday evening, and even Friday morning in the second square, refused to smell.
The distance and the way their energy is exchanged with this happy and energetic population clearly indicates that they are players who can win on Sunday, and when the sun falls on Le Golf National, except for Fleetwood and Molinari, there will be no other famous player to guarantee the possible victory of Europe.
preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it’s still too early to talk about Europe’s greatness.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly completed the work of Sergio Garcia, which was next to Alex Noren, the four-day Olympics.
A bungee and two dolls in the first floor, Spaniard and Swede put in a hole that they could never get out of.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Watching four races and four balls from close due to the interaction between the players, the advice they give and don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in a moment is very attractive.
So far, Europe has had better performance as a team, and it comes to the end of the day with significant advantage, but this season of four games has shown that the U.S. team has also dared and fought against the war, something that some people, particularly Americans, were skeptical about.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe has a advantage of 10-6.
After the four-and-a-half matches appeared very well on Saturday, Europe was able to run 10-6 out of the United States and have a good advantage on the final day.
The wonderful Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari couples were able to gain two victorys against Tiger Woods who were trying to get a lot of effort and inspire others and bring their score on Le Golf National so far.
Thomas Bjorn of the European team, who wanted to keep a cup that had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, was able to defeat one of the four American players who had a bad launch and beat the score of 3-1.
The U.S. team showed more resistance in four matches and won two matches, but they could not compensate for their back.
Jim Furyk team will need eight points from 12 Sunday solo matches to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European new job that takes four points behind, while she and Molinari doubled the “Molliewood” after a weekend, and in the history of the Ryder Cup, there are the second couple who get four points from their first four races.
After the victory over Woods and Patrick Reed in four ball matches, they successfully defeated the new work of Bryson Dhambeau, whose spirit was destroyed with a more decisive result of 4&5.
Woods, who had won hardly two matches on Saturday, showed their skill and talent, but failed in 19 to 29 of their competitions in four races, four ball and seven matches.
Justin Rose had rest in the four-seat tournaments and returned for four-person tournaments to his partner Henry Stevenson and they were able to win 1&2 on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which are in the first and third world.
However, the Europeans won’t take their way to China on a happy day, along with an air-conditioned tunnel in the south of Paris.
The large winners of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a good example for Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They took a heavy 1&2 win against Johan Ram and Ian Poulter from Spain, and later returned to the field, and in four matches, when they lost the first two holes, they were able to win 3&4 on Poulter and Joe McIlroy.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it happened only twice that a team could compensate for four backward points of life and enter the individual competition, although the Fryk team only needs the same size to keep the cup.
However, after a second in two days, it seems to have been too difficult for them to face the anti-Sunday attack.
North Korea says there is no way to disarm one side.
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the sanctions continue to make the United States more confident and under such circumstances would not be the same as giving up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho's annual General Assembly said North Korea had done a significant \"signment to show Hassan China\" in the past year, including stopping nuclear and missile tests, eliminating nuclear testing site and committed to the lack of the development of nuclear weapons and technology.
He said, “However, we did not receive any appropriate answers from the United States.”
Without trust in the United States, there will be no assurance about our national security, and under such circumstances we will not act as first and as a side towards the disarming of our weapons.”
Although Riyadh reiterates North Korea’s repeated criticism of Washington’s resistance against the approach to the “communication” of nuclear weapons, which is based on the North Korea’s implementation of each step, the statement repeats again, but his statement is so significant that Pyongyang does not deny the possibility of disarming nuclear weapons in a whole way.
Ri points to a joint statement committed by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first official meeting held between the current US president and North Korean leader on June 12, in Singapore, where Kim is committed to efforts to “turning the nuclear weapons of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea has been looking for official ending the war of 53-1950 Korea, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first take advantage of its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted requests to reduce international strict sanctions against North Korea.
Riyadh said, “The United States insists on the approach of “the nuclear weapon’s inferno,” and by increasing sanctions pressure, he intends to reach his goal by using force and even opposes “the end of war.”
Some foolish people think that sanctions can put us on the knee, that's a weird idea.
“But the problem is that the sanctions continue to increase our confidence.”
Ri did not mention the second meeting program between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president had said a few days ago in the United Nations this week.
Instead of three sessions held between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months, the minister said: “If the side was in front of the nuclear weapons, rather than the United States, it was South Korea, it would not have been caught by the nuclear weapons of the Korean Peninsula.”
However, Mr. Ri's speech was quite different from last year, he told the United Nations General Assembly last year that after Mr. President Trump called Kim \"the man of a missile\" that is suicide, it is unavoidable to target the land of the United States with North Korean missiles.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to destroy North Korea last year, for Kim's courage to move towards the disarming of weapons, had a lot of glory, but he said there should still be a lot to do, and sanctions should remain until the North Korean nuclear weapons break down.
Trump said on Wednesday that he had no time frame for it, saying, “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia said the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the United Nations Security Council: “The sanctions on the Security Council must continue with intensity and without failure until we make sure the nuclear weapons are completely, fully and confirmed.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has been working to increase North Korea’s sanctions to fund nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the border of the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would go back to Pyongyang in the next month to prepare the field for the second meeting of the two leaders of the two countries.
Pompeo had traveled to North Korea three times during this year, but his last trip didn’t go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying the progress has been made, but North Korea only charged him for a few hours after he was accused of “Gigster’s demands”.
North Korea was committed to meeting Moon in the current month if the U.S. adopted “a proper agreement”, a missile site, as well as a nuclear complex.”
He said Kim had told him that his purpose was to “responsibly” security guarantees that Trump was committed in Singapore and said he was going to move toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students spend enough rest.
This year, a new lesson at Harvard University, in an effort to fight the expansion of Macho culture in the field of study among the “Secretary Night” that caffeine consumes more, than all undergraduate students want to sleep more.
One of the University’s professors found that most of the world’s best university students are unconscious about the basic principles of their own self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women, designed this lesson and believed that this lesson in the United States is in its first type.
After a speech that had little effect on learning, he decided to launch the curriculum.
He said to Telegraph, “At the end of a girl came to me and said, ‘Why now and in my last year, this was told to me?’
He said no one had told me about the importance of sleep – that made me wonder.”
This curriculum is first put in the curriculum this year and explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving public health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said that the university was seriously undersleeping during the week, decided to add this lesson to the curriculum.
This one-hour course includes a set of interactive activities.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books, and information about the impact of caffeine, light, and how sports function is affected by sleep, and also the importance of habitability when sleeping.
In other words, participants are told how a lack of sleep in the long run can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
Professor Czeisler added: “We know that this lesson will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know – just as you are right to know the effects of smoking on health.”
He said there is still a culture of honoring \"living night\", and the addition of modern technology and increasing pressure on students shows that a lack of sleep is a problem to increase.
He said that ensuring enough sleep and quality should be a student to cope with stress, fatigue, and anxiety – even preventing excess weight, because it takes the brain to be hungry, which makes a person feel hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California who studied in the field of chemical and physical biology, and last year, in his first year in Harvard, he participated in one of the professor's classes, helping Professor Czeisler.
He said this lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to try to present it across the campus of the university.
He expressed hope and said that the next step is to apply for all graduate students before joining the competitive institution, to offer a similar education program.
Professor Czeisler advised that students need to set up an alert to determine their sleep time, as well as their wake time, and be aware of the harmful effects of \"Blue light\" absorbed by electronic devices and LED lighting systems that can remove your nighttime rhythm from balance and lead to trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Flower Menga caused the failure of Garrard subs
The Dolly Menga hit the team from Steven Grinder, causing the ringers' blue tape team to be defeated in a race outside the other home in Livingston, with the result of 0-1.
The Ibrox team was looking for its first score after the 1-4 win at St Johnstone, but the Gary Hall's second failure in 18 games, which was the coach, to hold their team with eight differences in the follow-up of Ladbros Premiership, the team Hearts.
Menga produced seven minutes before the first half of its flower, and the Rangers’ subsidies with their little motivation, they could never offer a good show that is needed to accelerate the game.
While Rangers now fell to the sixth rank, Livingston reached the third rank and is only due to the use of flower behind Hibernian.
One of the players of Rangers, called Calum Space, was wounded by the launch of the object which was apparently thrown out of the end of the stadium, and to treat the wound of his head, must be put under the board and this can be a problem for them.
Garrard created eight changes in the team that launched Ayr’s past to the final half of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went to the field with the same 11 former Livingston player who had been able to take a score of Hearts last week and should be happy to defeat their competitors every time.
Rangers may have more ball ownership, but Livingston made better use of the balls that they have.
They should only come in two minutes after coming in when Menga sent the ball with its first deep past for Scott Pittman on the Gate of Allan McGregor, but the hacker lost this great opportunity and sent the ball away with a long distance.
A free blow was struck by Keaghan Jacobs and reached Captain Craig Halckett, but his team defender Alan Litgow was able to send only a long distance back to the door.
Rangers took control of the game, but there was more hope about their game on a third end, than trust.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that it should be announced in the last fifteen minutes when he met Steven Lawless, but the Court of Steven Tomson did not pay attention to the demands of the Colombian player and pointed out that he would be far away.
Rangers only ran in the first half of the gate, but the former bank gate Ibrox, Liam Kelly, suffered a little bit with the blow on the head of Lasana Coulibaly and the silent hit of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the 34-minute flower of Livingston may be against the flow of the game, no one can deny that they had the right to argue.
The Rangers were no longer able to get after the Jacobs programs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robbinson, and he brought the ball to Menga with the bleeding, and he also easily hit the end and opened the door.
Garrard switched between the two half, Coulibly and Ryan Kent, and this change occurred when the attacker was about to bring the ball to Morelos, but Kelly came out of the gate with a beautiful motion and prevented it from reaching it.
But Livingston continued to offer exactly the beauty game that viewers loved, and Lithgow and Halckett once again took the high ball.
But McGregor stood well against Jacobs before Lithgow hit the top to the ball that was sent from the car.
The ringers’ replacement player Glenn Middleton claimed in the final moments that when he faced Jacobs, he had to be declared a penalist, but he did not pay any attention to her again.
Yearbook: Prescription of the Gigger Count
And now a page of our Sunday Memorial magazine: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago in such a day and counting... the day when the next physicist Johannes Wilmelm Lee Geiger was born in Germany.
Gager developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a machine that was known as the Guerger count.
In the 1950s, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, the scientists who didn’t seem to be cowboys, the Geiger Counter, who was one of the main principles of science, became one of the main principles of general culture:
Man: \"What's that?\"
Rogers: “Giger’s number is used to track radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put the phone on the meat, you can really hear the effects of atoms that are caused by radioactivity in the mineral.
Evans: \"It's really going to be right now!\"
He was dead in 1945 just a few days before his 63 birthday.
But the invention named him is still alive.

The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify patient cells as part of the treatment
This method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
Then they can see the protein that is common in many cancers and then reinvent it.
A test vaccine showed promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman with the vaccine that teaches the immune system was treated, and her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes extracting the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab so that they can see a common protein that exists in many cancers and called HER2, and then re-injecting these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States National Cancer Institute at Beatsda Maryland said: “Our conclusion is that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofsky explained that HER2 is \"the development of several types of cancer\" including breast cancers, ovarians, lung and large intestines.
A similar approach to removing the immune cells from the patient’s body and training to how cancer cells are targeted is successfully treated in the treatment of some type of blood cancer.
By wearing a MAGA hat after his presence in SNL, Kanye West paid a fan of Trump.
It wasn't good enough.
Kanye West, after his performance on Saturday Night Live, praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would be elected in the studio in 2020.
After the third song of that night, Ghost Town, in which a hat with Maake America Great, expressed an infamous speech against Democrats and stressed Trump’s support.
“There’s a lot of times when I talk to white people and they say, ‘How do you love Trump, he’s racist?’
“If I were worried about racism, I would have to go before the United States for a long time.”
The SNL began the program with the art of Matt Damon, where Hollywood’s star inspired by the testimony of Bret Kavanaugh at the Senate Justice Committee on the claim of sexual rape that was raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although this section was not broadcast, the West's words were uploaded by Kimin Chris Rock on social media.
It’s not clear whether Rock was going to sell West.
West also told the audience that behind the scene had a difficult problem because of the hat covered.
According to Washington Examminer, he said: “They told me at the back of the scene.
They said, “Don’t go there with that hat.”
And they used to force me!
And then they said to me, \"You are in the lowest place.\"
West continued, \"What do you want to see the poor space?\" and then he said, \"You're wearing my Superman's ear, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love.”
Veriety reported that his talk made him at least twice from the audience, and seemed to be the SNL broadcasters were hand-handed, and someone said, “The studio took the silence of death.”
“West died in the last moments as an alternative to the American singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend Mac Miller, who was a rap singer, had died a few days ago.
West, by performing the song I Love it and while his dress was like a Perrier bottle, surprised many people.
West backed the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, he tweeted: “Thanks to one of the bravest people: thanks for the resistance to MOB.”
But the host of the conversation program, Karen Hunter tweeted that the West “is going to show us what he really believes, and that’s definitely amazing.”
“But I prefer not to support someone I think is accepting and spreading the way I think it’s harmful to my society (by buying music or clothes or support from “heshor”).
He added: He is free.
“We too.”
Before the program, the rap reader in Twitter announced that he changed his name and said that he was now “the creature that was previously known as Kanye West”.
He is not the first artist to change his name and place a dy foot known as Puff Dady, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His partner Snoop Dog, a rap singer, was previously his name Snoop Lion, and of course he changed his name as a sign, and then became an artist known as Prince.
Against the murder after the knife in the Balfest restaurant.
After a man was in a restaurant on Friday in East Belfast, a 45-year-old man was accused of murder.
The police said the incident occurred in Balyhackamore.
The accused is expected to be present on Monday at the bill.
The charges will be examined by the general prosecutor.
Kit Harington was criticized for Sami's men's syndrome.
Kit Harington is known for playing the role of Jon Snow, which is a skilled female sword in the violent, fantasy and medieval series of the crown game and the HBO network bed.
But the 31-year-old actor has been criticized for having the hero of Mexico, saying that showing such roles often makes young boys feel like they should be tough and hard to be respected.
In a discussion with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that “the church came” and asked him how he had to deal with toxic men’s problem at MeToo’s age.
Kit, recently married with the star of his supplemental role in the crown and bed series, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, acknowledged that it felt “strong” about the problem.
He said, “Now, I personally feel really powerful – where did we make mistakes about men?”
“What have we taught men when they were growing, in terms of the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that TV, thanks to its very male characters, may be somewhat responsible for the rise of toxic men.
He continued: “What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on television and streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in our course - how should we change it?
“It’s clear that a topic for young men is wrong.”
He also announced in the interview that when the series of crowns and beds ended in the next summer, he did not want to play in the series or continue to play the series, saying, “He’s done with the battlefield and horses.”
In November, the True West plays Sam Shepard, who narrates the story of a filmmaker and his brother who is a sabotage.
The actor recently revealed that he seemed to be the best news of the crown and bed game for him, meeting his wife Rose.
He said, “I’ve met my wife in this series, so he gave me this story of my future family and life from here to next.”
Rose plays Ygridte's role in this fantasy series, which won the Emmy Prize, the character character of Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in identifying new cases
China has announced a 14% mutation in the number of citizens living in HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 82,000 people in the country have the disease.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sex, which indicates a change to the past.
Traditionally, HIV has rapidly spread in some parts of China due to the injection and transmission of infected blood.
China's health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said, but the number of people who have been infected with HIV has decreased and has almost zero.
However, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people annually.
The transmission of HIV through sex is a serious problem in the LGBT community.
In 1997 homosexuality went out in an illegal state, but discrimination against LGBT people is very common.
Research has estimated that because of the conservative values of the country, 90%-70 of men who had sex with men are eventually married to women.
Many cases of transmission of the disease occur due to insufficient sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government as part of efforts to deal with this problem has promised to provide access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters rejected his employee in the disclosure of the information of GOP senators.
The U.S. representative Maxine Waters rejected claims on Saturday that one of his employees had sent three U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat Los Angeles announced that these claims were raised by experts and websites of “right-right radical”.
Waters in a statement published in Twitter, said, “Despite, avoid and still repeat lies.”
According to reports, data published including home address and phone number of Senate Senators Mr Lindsey Graham from South California and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch both of the Uta state.
Information sent on the Internet Thursday by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during one of the Senate meetings on sexual abuse claims that were raised against the Supreme Court Court Brettt Kavanaugh.
It was done a long time later that these three Senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Hill reported that conservative sites such as Gateway Pendit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of these posts was dependent on the Waters office and released information from one of the Waters staff.
Waters continued: “This claim is completely false and absolutely false.”
“My employee – whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these false and fake claims – has never been responsible for the disclosure of this information.
“This claim is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters’ statement quickly led to online criticism, including the former press outlet of the White House Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer said, “This was a liar with anger.”
“It shows that he doesn’t have the right spirit to join Congress.
When someone is accused of what he has not done, he should not be angry.
You shouldn’t spend a lot of money.
He should not question the perpetrators’ motives.
It must be calm and faithful.”
Fleischer seems to have compared the response to the Democrats' response to the judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of criticizing that they seemed to be very angry on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, one of the Republican candidates who wanted to take place in the midterm elections, also announced his opinion on Twitter.
He tweeted, “If he is healthy, it is a great claim.”
Waters said in his statement that his office had warned the “relevant courts and legal institutions” regarding these false claims.
He added: “We will make sure that the agents will be determined and take responsibility for all the destructive and dangerous measures they have done to one person or all my employees.”
Reviews of Johnny English Strikes Again - Anti-Corruption and Poor Rowan Atkinson
It has recently been suggested that in any new film that relates to the UK, we will see signs of Brexit and it appears to be true about the new version of the Johnsony English film – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was reborn in 2011 with Johnny English.
Will it be a new opportunity for people to make a film about how much we really are posting?
However, Johnny English has a great eye, a rubber face and a new version for the second time – whose name reveals more than anything that is a rare character designed for non-English programming areas.
Of course, he is a stupid agent who, despite his strange appearance to the English fatty, a little of the character of the detective Clouseau, blended the scenes of Mr Bean and a little of his character, and combined the man with the fire chariots in the 2012 Olympics opening.
He is also primarily based on the man-made and international man-in-law-inson’s mystery when it was broadcast in Barclaycard TV ads that are now forgotten, and left the place after the chaos.
In the latest version of JE, there are only one or two beautiful scenes.
I loved the scene that Johnny English, while the medieval armor covering the helicopter closes, and its bridges would be briefly touched by his hat.
Atkinson’s gift is for physical comedy on the scene, but it’s felt that it’s weak and strangely too much, especially because it’s now “new” brand films like 007 and their impossible mission, with confidence, offer comedy as part of the film components.
It is felt that the film was more intended for children than adults, and in my opinion, the events of Johnny English, compared to the sweets of Atkinson in the films of protested as Bean personality, initiatives, and less focus.
This time, the theme of the film is that Britain is at risk of serious danger.
A cyber hacker invades the UK’s top spy network and reveals the identity of all British spies by fear of being serving spies – a sad little role for Kevin Eldon.
This last blow for a prime minister is an important and under-pressure face, and before the lack of political popularity, Emma Thompson has completely disappeared: Emma Thomson offers its best performance in the same role as Teresa-May, but there is nothing more in the film that can be used.
His intelligence advisers inform him that since all active spies are compromised, he must re-use one of the retired.
And this means that the same Johnny English now serves as a teacher in a modern educational institution and is offering confidential lessons about how to be a secret factor: there are some beautiful work sweets here and in the scenes that English is teaching at the Academy of Spying.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall and presented in a short notice session, then joined its former partner Bough who had a lot of problems together, which will be played again by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been trained and transferred to a submarine commander, the role of a high class woman who played Viicki Pepperdine but could not play well.
So Batman and Robin, who made everything wrong in Her Majesty’s Secret Service, returned to the scene and joined Olga Kurylenko, who played the role of a beautiful woman called Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is subjected to a dangerously active billionaire in the field of technology that has the character of the Caribbean, he claims it could solve British computer problems: the negative role of Jason Volta, which is played by Jack Lacy.
English and Bough Edits start their humor: They serve as a firefighter to a French restaurant; they are led by hiding their trafficking on the luxury Volta boat and exiting the country, and English is trying to use virtual reality to familiarize the interior of the Volta house.
Of course, all efforts have been made for the last scene, but while it’s pleasant and still active, the effects of special children’s films are also seen throughout the film.
Something completely average.
And like the rest of Johnny English films, I couldn’t find an answer to this question: Can the British film industry be able to play a role to Rowan Atinson, which is really proportional to his talent?
The Labour Party has been designing a plan based on which English worked four days a week, but has rejected the rights for as many as five days.
The Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party is planning for an extreme plan that will cause English to work four days a week - but to pay as much as five days.
According to the reports, the party wants to give employees more leave day by using the savings created through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI).
This plan will allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend vacation – and continue to receive the same previous pay.
Sources say that this idea is with the economic plan of the party, and the party is trying to move the country towards the interests of workers.
The move towards the four-day working week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way to benefit workers from the changing economy.
One of the top sources of the Labour Party said to Sunday Times: “It is expected to re-evaluate policies before the end of the year.
“This won’t happen overnight, but the week plan has four working days is a desire that suits the party’s approach to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to confirm such an idea, but the Green Party in its 2017 election campaign was committed to the implementation of the week's plan of work four days.
However, this demand is not now generally approved by the Labour Party.
One of the speakers of the Labour Party said, “The week does not have four working days of the party’s politics, and the party has no program for it.”
The top in the shadow, John McDonnell used a conference week before the Labour Party to explain his opinion about a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to take power in public service companies from the directors of the “unknowing” and “useer”.
It also means that the shareholders of water companies can’t afford all their shares because the government of the Labour Party can “create” from them based on the transgression they’ve done.
He also confirmed that he plans to bring workers into the corporate board and create a group-owned fund to transfer 10% of private sector capital to employees, which means reaching a maximum annual profit of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told “60 Minutes” whether FBI’s research on Kavanaugh was able to change their opinion.
FBI’s research on charges entered against the judges of Bret Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for his candidate for the Supreme Court for at least one week, and it gives the question to the mind whether the findings of this administration can force any of the Republican senators to withdraw their support from him.
\"60 Minutes\" Scott Pelley, in an interview released on Sunday, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether FBI’s findings could lead to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more clear than his partner, South California.
Kennedy said, “I think, of course.”
“As I said I went to the court meeting, I spoke to the judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened, I called him and said, \"Have you done this?\"
He was decisive, determined and sure.”
However, Graham’s vote seemed unchanging.
“I announced my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and such accusations can’t change it.”
Graham added to Christine Blasey Ford: “Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejected it.”
“And whoever named it can’t confirm the subject.
He is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new to change my mind.”
What is the World Citizenship Festival, and is it working to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizenship Festival, which is an annual music event where a very well-known group of stars runs and has a very important mission; ending global poverty.
The World Citizenship Festival, which is now in its seventh year, has driven tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn Park to not only enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but their awareness of the main purpose of the event, which is ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizenship Festival started in 2012 is one of the developed parts of the World Poverty Project, a global support group hoping to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of active people in the field of fighting poverty.
People who want to participate in the concert, in order to receive a free ticket of this event (if they are willing to pay a VIP ticket fee), they must help by doing a set of tasks or “competences” such as volunteering, emailing to one of the global leaders, contacting or any other effective way to raise awareness about their goal means to end poverty.
But how successful has the world citizen, while it has 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, the right way to encourage them to call for action demand or another kind of \"cicktivism\"? - People who have done a great job by signing a online roll or sending a tweet.
Global citizenship says that more than 19 million \"damaged\" have been documented by its supporters since 2011 to achieve a lot of different goals.
They say that these measures helped global leaders move and take commitments and policies with more than $37 billion in advance to make positive effects by 2030 in life.
In early 2018, the group pointed out to 390 commitments and notices that at least $10 billion had already been paid, or that they had been collected.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives based in the UK, who are committed to obtaining more than 4700 tweets from global citizenship, “to help children grow and reach their full potential” and promised that 35 million dollars would help the country to help eliminate food abuse in the region.
The Ambassador of Nutrition Mrs. Tracy Ullman in April 2018 spoke to the crowd during a live concert: “With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens such as you can eliminate nutrition that is a social injustice and link to history.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions conducted in the United Kingdom to improve mother and child nutrition, the government said the government had allocated the necessary cost for a project called nutrition power, which would include food intervention for 5 million women and children.
A global citizen responded to one of the common questions on his website that asked, “What makes you think we can eliminate the absolute poverty?”
“This will be a long and hard path – sometimes we will eat and not succeed.
But like the civil and anti-optacetic rights movements that have been done before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Jane Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, are some of the artists who will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman in New York event.
The U.S. can use the Navy to \"return\" to prevent Russia's energy exports - the country's minister
According to Washington Examminer, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zike, Washington said that Washington could “if necessary” “to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, to its Navy.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially that his activity is carried out to the call of the legitimate government – is an excuse to discover new energy markets.
According to his reports, he said, “I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to convince themselves of their energy just like they do in the East and in the southern part of Europe.”
According to this position, there are methods and tools to deal with.
He said: “The United States has the ability to ensure that marine routes are open and if necessary, block them to make sure their energy does not go to the market.”
Zinke spoke to an event that was hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group and called himself “energy consumer” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, and said they were in the same way.
While he learned from Russia as a \"a single product country\" with the economy associated with fossil fuels, he said, \"There is an economic opportunity for Iran and Russia, less and more, affecting and replaceing fuel.\"
These statements suggest that Trump’s policy is in contrast to increasing natural gas exports to Europe and replacing it with the European gas, which is a cheaper but farer option for European consumers.
To achieve this goal, Trump’s administration officials, including the U.S. president Donald Trump, are trying to encourage Germany to leave the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which says Trump, “the race” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 tube line, designed to double the existing tube line capacity and bring it to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin says that Washington’s severe opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of an insurgency competition.
The Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, after a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September, said: “I think we have a share in this issue that energy should not be a tool for pressure enforcement and consumers should be able to choose suppliers.
The U.S. position made a strong response to Germany and reiterated its commitment to the project.
The German industry leader, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has advised the United States to avoid interference in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Deter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting held between the Greater German Angela Merkel and the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, said, ‘It is not possible for me to interfere with a third government in our energy supply.’
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren says he will participate in the competition for the 2020 presidential election.
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that \"really\" will participate in competition for inter-state agreements.
Warren confirmed in the municipal meeting at Holyoke Massachusetts, which is looking for the company to compete.
According to The Hill, he said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington and make our poor government right, and this includes placing a woman in the office.
“After November 6, I will be looking for competition for the president.”
In a municipal meeting, Warren, in opposition to Donald Trump, said, “He’s going to take this area in the wrong direction.”
He said, “I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy.”
Warren has so far criticized Trump and the candidate introduced by him for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Before voting, we’ll definitely need FBI research.”
However, the results of a survey published on Thursday showed that most people in their chosen areas were not willing to participate in the 2020 election.
According to a survey at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, 58 percent of the presidential voters said the senator should not participate in the election.
Thirty-two percent of his company supported the election.
The survey found that people support the former Governor Deval Patrick, 38% of his potential company and 48 percent of his opposition.
Other prominent Democrats, which are likely to attend the 2020 election, are former vice president of Joe Bunken and Senator Wenie Sanders.
Associated Press reported that the decision will be officially announced by January.
Sarah Palin in the Donald Trump Election Meeting referred to the PTSD of his son Track Palin
Track Palin, who is 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after writing for military force in September.
He was arrested on Monday at a domestic violence incident.
His mother in Trump's election meeting at Tusla Olympama said, \"What's going to happen to my son after his return, what's going to happen to him, I can call other families who feel the negative effects of PTSD and some damage that our soldiers have returned with.
Paulin spoke of his son’s arrest as “a great problem that everyone ignores” and said about his son and other veterans, “They go to the country in a different way, they come back with hard hearts, they ask whether it is for respect for what their military friends and their air force and any other member of the army have given to the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla Alaska, and, according to the report of domestic violence and having guns in a drunken state, was accused of domestic violence against a woman.
18 states, as well as D.C. support the challenge of new policy on refugees.
On the other hand, 18 states support the establishment of a legal challenge for the new U.S. policy that prevents refugees from fleeing from criminal groups or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives of 18 states and the department of Friday in Washington provided brief advice to the court that challenged the asylum policy.
The full name of Shiaki in the request of Grace v. Sessions that the American Civil Freedom Union offered in August against federal policy has not yet been identified.
He said his candidate, along with his son, who are a member of the violent group, had abused him, but the U.S. officials have denied his request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The government’s lawyer who supported Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who has been sent to the United States from there, are countries that are widely faced with problems related to non-colades and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum has cancelled the decision to renew the status of migrants, allowing illegal immigrants who fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the prosecutor of the Columbia Department of Friday, said in a statement that the new policy “does not ignore state, federal, and international law.”
In a brief consultation, he said, “On the basis of the federal law, all asylum requests must be examined based on the exact facts and conditions of the application, and such an exception violates the principle.”
The lawyers also argued that, according to the possibility, there is a lot of potential that entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary job” and concluded that the policy that prevents migrants from entering the US economy would harm the US economy.
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that the immigration judges would not grant escape victims of domestic abuse and violence against non-necessary groups.
Sesions said on his 11th June about this policy: “The persecution is available for those who have left their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in specific social groups or political views.
Refugees have never meant to solve all the problems -- even all serious problems -- that people around the world have faced on a daily basis.
Despite double the number of casualties, it is hard to find survivors in Palu.
The conditions for the survivors were increasingly and increasingly slow.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while her baby son's body hurts her in an evacuation facility in the city, Paula said, \"I'm so bad.\"
“Every moment the ambulance takes the bodies.
Clean water is perfect.”
It has been observed that the inhabitants return to their lost homes, they are flooded with water and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals have been damaged and destroyed due to a 7.5-star earthquake.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, whose shoulder and back had been broken, had rest outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were there for continuing strong aftermath.
When she began to express her feelings about the strong earthquake, the fifth-room room of the hotel where she, her wife, and her daughter were involved, she had tears in her eyes.
Haris said to Associated Press, “We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was thrown into the ruins of the wall and added that his family was present for a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife cry and want help, but then her voice stopped.
I don’t know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they will be in a safe place.”
The U.S. ambassador accused China of “propaganda’s imagination”
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement in one of the U.S. newspapers about the two-way benefits of the U.S. agreement, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to publish propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday after accused China of trying to intervene in the U.S. Congress elections on November 6, which he denied, pointed out to the China Daily Police Supplement on Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper Lowa.
Trump’s accusations about Beijing’s attempt to intervene in the U.S. elections showed what U.S. officials said to Reuters was the beginning of a new stage of escalation by Washington.
While advertising orders to promote trade are common for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are now involved in a growing trade war that has led to imports of each other’s goods.
Chinese and American experts said the trade-off tariffs were designed to hit exporters in states such as Lowa, who supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstadt, a U.S. ambassador to China who had long been the governor of Lowa and is one of the major exporters of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hit workers, farmers and American businesses.
\"Branstad in an article published in the Des Moines Registerer, wrote: \"China is continuing by printing propaganda in our free press.
Branstad wrote: “The Chinese government, by publishing monetary advertising on Des Moines Register, is using its propagan distribution to benefit from the popular tradition of expression and free press in the United States.”
“In return, you’ll see that there are limited opposite voices in Beijing’s sales newspaper here, and there are no real reflections of the opposite opinions that people might be concerned about the economic path of China because the media are under severe control of the Communist Party of China.”
He added, “One of the most prominent newspapers before accepting his paper edition,” he said, “He did not say what newspaper he meant.”
Analysts warn Republicans that the Republicans with Kavanaugh’s scandal are fleeing female voters from the midterm elections.
Analysts have warned that many Republicans, in the face of several sexual rape claims, defend the Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavanaugh, and insist on his choice, this will lead to a mutual reaction, particularly on women’s side in the midterm election.
The emotions that exist around this matter are very high, and often Republicans have shown that they want to progress by vote.
Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at the College of Maxwell University of Syrahuse in an article published Saturday, said to The Hill, “These things can’t be returned back.”
Reeher said that the support for the minute of the New Age of Jeff Flaake (R-Arzona) would be sufficient from the FBI’s research to calm the angry voters.
According to the Washington newspaper, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, the senior advisor and national speaker of the growing group, MoveOn said, “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget tomorrow or November.”
Mic reported that despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Republicans have the control of the judiciary elected to address Kavanaugh's nomination, the protesters protested Friday morning on the road to the Senate and shouted, \"Noam is on the road!\"
Stu Rothenberg, an online analyst, said to the news site, “The impact and motivation of Democrats is going to increase dramatically.”
“People say that this desire was already high, it was true.
But it can go higher, especially among female voters who have doubts, and young people who don’t often vote, even though they don’t like the president.”
Even before the public testimony of Mrs. Ford, in which details of his claims about sexual rape against the Supreme Court’s candidate, analysts said that if Republicans support his approval, there would be a mutual response.
According to the report, Mr. Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, said, “This has become a complicated problem for GPP.”
Guy Cecil, a group helping the Democrats win the election, said to the news channel: “It’s not just a vote of the committee or the final vote, or that Kavanaugh trial, but the way Republicans have worked to manage the subject, and how they treat him is also important.”
However, Americans seem to have died after the testimony done by Ford and Kavanaugh in who to believe what to say, of course it seems to have a little more pro.
A recent survey conducted by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe that or possibly because they believe Ford’s testimony while 35 percent said they would definitely believe Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh had certainly lied or probably in their testimony, while only 30 percent believed about Ford.
The Guardian reported that after the release of the FBI support, the FBI police is investigating claims raised by Ford as well as at least one other accused called Debate Ramirez.
Ford was sworn last week at the Senate judicial committee and testified that Kavanaugh had raped him in a drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate of the Supreme Court, while studying in the Yale in the 1980s, together with a guest, showed him his genitals.
The World Wide Web developers plan to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee is a global web network developer that is looking to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project is a company based on the open text platform erners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their information is stored and what information is allowed to access.
Berners-Lee in a dedicated interview with Fast Company said the idea behind Inrupt is “world.”
He said about this startup, “We have to do it right now.”
“This is a historic moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “recovering online personal information” or POD.
This space can contain the list of audiences, list of jobs, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is like that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and in a browser.
What makes this online storage space unique to personal information is that it depends entirely on the user who can access the type of information.
The company calls this “personal ability through information”.
According to John Bruce, the idea of Intrupt is that the company can provide resources, processes and skills to help put Solid available.
The company is now out of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who have been contracted to work on the project with them and a set of volunteers programmers.
Since this week, tech developers from all over the world can create their decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not speak to Facebook and Google about creating or creating a complete change that makes all their business models a night.
“We won’t let them.”
Berners-Lee in a post published in the media on Saturday, wrote that “Inrupt’s contribution to commercial and ecosystem energy is to help protect the integrity and quality of a new web that is built on Solid.”
Berners-Lee, in 1994, changed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential face on the network’s neutral debate in recent months.
Berners-Lee will remain even with the launch of Interrupt, founder and director of the World Wide Web, Web Foundation and the Open Information Institute.
Berners-Lee added: “I’m great compared to the next great web era.
Bernard Vann: The Church of the Victorian Cross received in the First World War
From the only priest of the Church of England who was able to receive the Victorian cross as a warrior in World War I, it was the hundredth anniversary of receiving this award in his hometown.
Mr. Colonel Barnard Vann received the award on September 29, 1918 in attacking Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a single shooter and was never told that he had received the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, the memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said that exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s masterpiece, which led to this honor, was revealed from his memorial stone, “indulgent and intelligent.”
According to the London Gazette report on September 29, 1918, Vann led its leader in Canal de Saint-Quentin, \"in a heavy and heavy fire bomb and gun\".
He later attacked the fire line and led the line to three groups with the \"all\" alone and before the ball attack.
Colonel II Vann was killed by a single German shooter on October 4, 1918 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann 72 said his grandfather's actions were \"what I know I could never be good at, but it's small.\"
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, who was led by the Royal King’s Youth Group, went on to remember him on earth.
Michael Vann said, “He feels so proud that he has played a role in the race,” and added, “The vision of a true hero with the support performed by a lot of people.”
MMA fans stayed all night until they watched the Bellator 206, but instead Peppa Pig was given their share.
Imagine you’ve been awake all night to watch a 206 Bellator only to watch the main event.
San Jose’s account included 13 battles, including six battles on the main card that were live throughout the night from the Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Ray MacDonald were ready to confront each other, the television coverage was cut off and the Peppa Pig cartoons were broadcast and the viewers were amazed and angry.
Some of them felt bad after they remained to watch the fight until the early morning.
One of the fans on Twitter called the change of the program to the children’s cartoons “unprecedented jokes.”
Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications Bellator when asked about this change of the program, said: “This is a state regulation that isn’t appropriate at 6:00 a.m., so they had to change the program to children’s cartoons.”
“Peppa Pig,” yes.
The CEO of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they wanted to work on their plans to cover the UK's viewers in the future.
“When I think of it again, I think we can think of it.”
“But in that case, it was Sunday 6 a.m., and we can’t get an idea until Sunday at our time and Monday, on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when this change of the program was done, a lot of messages were rejected, and these messages were not friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a state problem.
I can promise you that this will not happen in the future.
We will reduce the number of battles from six to five struggles – such as what we usually do – this time we tried to offer more services to fans and just tried it.
It’s a sad situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “true” because of sexual desire
Tom Daley says he grew up because of his sexual desire to all – but it motivated him to succeed.
He, who was 24 years old, said he didn’t realize that “not everyone looks like me” until he went to high school.
While on the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs program performed by the experimental Lauren Laverne, he spoke clearly about the rights of homosexuals to give the rest of the “marriage”.
She also said her father would no longer care for the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the main experience of this old program has been abandoned for a few months due to illness.
Damley, who attended as a mysterious person in the first Laverne program, said he felt “right” than all other people because “socially, it was not acceptable to love boys and girls.”
He said, “Even to today, this sense of greed and being different has been real things that have given me the power and the ability to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that he was an important thing, in such a way that the rest of his sexual desires did not disappoint them.
He, who won the Olympic bronze medal twice, became a attention campaign of the LGBT, and used his presence in the games of this year in Australia and asked more countries to declare homosexuality.
He said that because he was speaking clearly that he felt like he was lucky to live openly without negative consequences, and he wanted to “make peace” to others.
He, who has been a champion of the world three times, said that he loved being a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - \"It surprises me.\"
Daley married the Oscar winner that was 20 years older than himself, but said that age distance had never been problematic.
“When you’re making so much progress at age 14, he went to the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14, and his father died for three years because of cancer – he said it was hard to find someone who had experienced similar heights and slopes.
The couple was born with a boy, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June, and Daley said, \"His general vision has changed.\"
“If you asked me a year ago, my whole attention was to take the gold medal,” he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than the Olympic Gold Medal.
“My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie.”
His son is Robert's father, who died at the age of 40 when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was dying and one of the last things he asked was whether he still had Olympic tickets in 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
He said, “I couldn’t tell him that you weren’t there before Father.”
“When his breath stopped, I had her hand in her hand, and when she was really cut off and died, I finally realized that she was not invincible.”
The next year, Daley won the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew this was what my whole life was in its dream – to face a crowd of my country in the Olympic Games, there was nothing better than that.”
This also inspired him for his first choice of song – Proud by Heather Small – who accompanied him to the Olympics and still has a lot of interest in it.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on Channel 4 Radio BBC Sunday at BST 11:15.
Mickelson sat at the Ryder Cup on the desktop on Saturday
Phil Mickelson, an American football game on Sunday with a 47th Ryder Cup, will get a new record, but will come on the form to prevent it from turning into an unpleasant turning point.
Mickelson, who participates in this two-year event for 12-year-olds, was shown by Captain Jim Furyk for four ball games and four on the hemisphere on Saturday.
The great player who has a history of five times winning in the card, rather than often going to the U.S. for the U.S. at the center of the game, spends his day working with a series of spectators and attempts to improve his game in the field of winning the ball, hoping that he could correct his problems.
The 48-year-old player who never and even at the peak of his game was not the best hit of the women, is not a good choice for hard competitions of Le Golf National, which usually have a deviation of the way of tall grass around the golf land.
And if these competitions are not as pleasant as they are, the Mickelson will face the ninth day of the Sunday with the exact British Open Championships, Francesco Molinari, which is set up with Tommy Fleetwood in a team to win all four matches this week.
If Americans, with the beginning of the 12 races, are four behind points, have a good start, the Mickelson race can be very critical and determined.
Furyk expressed confidence to his players, of course, he could not say anything else.
Furyk said, \"He fully noticed the role he had yesterday, he admired me and threw his hand around me and said tomorrow he will be ready.\"
“He is very confident about himself.
He got so much pride and in the past and this week, these teams have learned a lot of things from him.
I probably didn’t think he was playing in two matches.
I thought it was more than that, but I think we should accept it.
He wants to be in the field like anyone else.”
Mickelson will break the record of Nick Faldo on Sunday in the field of the largest number of attendance in the race Ryder.
It can be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that can never be well-documented by his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 lucks and seven reliefs, but Furyk said his presence is an invisible asset for the team.
He said: “He is funny, angry, and greedy, he loves to touch others, and he is a great man who is present at the team.
“I think younger players like him with criticism, including this week that he was watching.
“In addition to the game, there are many more things for us.”
Captain Europe Thomas Bjorn knows that their decisive superiority could soon be lost.
Thomas Bjorn, Europe’s captain, according to his experience, knows that walking on the last day of the solo tournament in the race of Ryder by having a significant advantage, can easily become an unpleasant end.
The Danish Open Golf began its career from the 1997 competition in Valderrama, a team with a team to Captain Seve Ballesteros five points ahead of Americans, but at the end they were able to win with a close result of 1⁄214-1⁄213.
The Bjorn, after watching the 3-5th-year-olds in 2018 on Friday and yesterday, which led to the advantage of 6-10 in Le Golf National, said with its visualization, “Remember that we had a decisive advantage in Valderrama, had a decisive advantage in Brookline, and we were lucky, but we had a little distance.”
So history showed me and all the people in that team that the game was not finished.
Tomorrow you have to go to the field with all the forces.
Go there and do the right thing.
The game has not been completed until the points are recorded on the TV.
We have a goal and our goal is to win the cup and your focus should be on that goal.
I’ve always said that I focus on 12 players who are in our team, but we’re fully aware of the team that is in front of us – the world’s biggest players.”
Bjorn, with the joy of the performance of his players in this hard golf competition, added: “I will never judge this in the case soon.
Tomorrow is quite different.
Tomorrow is individual performances that determine everything, and that’s what we need to do.
When everything goes well, it’s very good to be in a team with a spring, but when you’re alone in the field, your capabilities will be fully tested as an open golf.
This is the message you have to pass to the players, and tomorrow you will provide your best performance.
Now, YAR will leave your team and he must go and try to do his best.
In contrast to Bjorn, Captain Jim Furyk will be looking for a better individual performance than the team’s performance, but instead of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who could get three points from four points.
Furyk had both experienced these great changes in the last day, he was part of the winning team, but before Europe managed to perform “the miracle in Medinah” and made him end the game as a loser.”
In response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, Captain of 1999 prepared his players to start the last day, he said, “I remember all the damn words that day.”
“We have 12 major competitions tomorrow, but you’d like that quick start in Brookline, like you’ve seen in Medinah.
When the force moves one side, it creates a lot of pressure on those who are during the race.
“We set our composition on this basis and defeat their friends as we like, you know tomorrow we’re trying to do miracles.”
The task of trying to lead the struggle to Thomas's struggle is broken and faced with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rah, Tommy Fitwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans at the top half of the combination, in the top match with Joe McIlroy.
Bjorn said about his individual choices, “I put this group of people in this way, because I think it covers all parts.
Germany's new war has been delayed.
Local media reported that the newest fleet of the German Navy would have to be completed in 2014 to replace the old names of the Cold War, but because of the flaws in systems and high cost, it would not be ready until the next year.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, it has been delayed by a military spokesman, completing and sending the main ship to Rheinland-Pfalz from the new fleets of the Baden-Wuererttemberg class, until the first half of 2019.
The ship had to join the Navy in 2014, but after delivery, the fate of the project has been a challenge.
The four ships of Baden-Wuberttemberg, which ordered the Navy in 2007, will replace the old names of the Bremen class.
It is clear that these ships will benefit from a powerful ball, a series of anti-hyva-ship missiles, as well as several radar technologies, such as reducing the effects of radar, red and sound.
Their other important features include longer maintenance period – it is likely that it will be possible to use new names for up to two years away from its coast.
Die Zeit wrote, however, continuous delays mean that these modern names – which are said to allow Germany to increase its power in the waters outside the country – until it enters the Navy, it will be old.
Last year, when the German Navy officially refused to use the F125 and returned it to the Blomham & Voss ship factory in Hamburg, it had a lot of noise in the media.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship after delivery to the shiphouse.
There are little information about the reasons for this return, but the German media has been quoted with a number of severe \"innovations and hardware\" that have used the name if it is used to work for the mission of the war.
Software concepts are especially important because the woods of Baden-Wuererttemberg class ships will be exploited by a crew to a number of 120 million - which is only half the human force of the older names of the Bremen class.
Also, it was found that the ship is significantly heavier than the standard, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is thought that the 7,000-Pfalz ship is twice as heavy as it was used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from hardware charts, the total cost of the project – includes public education – also becoming a term.
It is said that the cost has reached a significant amount of £3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – from the initial cost of £2.2 billion.
The problems new names engage with them, with warnings about how the German Navy is slowing down.
This year, before Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament’s Defense Committee, said that the Navy was actually “continued to complete the evacuation ships.”
The official said that the problem has increased over time, as old ships have gone out of the mission, but alternative ships are not provided.
He was sorry that none of the names of the Baden-Wuerertberg class were not able to join the Navy.
National Trust explores the hidden life of bats
New research is being conducted in part of Scottish Highlands, with the goal of specifying how bats use this area for food hunting.
The findings of this research are expected to reveal a new zoom from the behavior of these unique bird mammals and help guide their protective activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland, followed by short lips and bats as well as high ears and bats in the Inverwe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recorders will be employed in key locations around the region to track bat activity during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform motion mapping using manual detectors.
The special analysis of the sound of all recorded cases will determine the frequency of the sounds of bats as well as what it does.
Then a map and report from their habitat will be created to create a detailed image on the regional scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar expressed hope for NTS, saying the results will determine which habitat areas are more important to bats and how to be used by any species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management practices, including the creation of herbivores and how forests are best suited for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, the host of bats in Scotland and across the UK has had a dramatic decline.
They are threatened by the construction and development works that affect their nests and cause their habitat to disappear.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be dangerous for them, as well as insecticide paper and some chemical compounds of construction materials, as well as the attack of domestic cats.
bats are not actually blind.
However, because of the habit of night hunting, when the topic of fishing comes, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a complex paving technique to determine the exact location of insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, is 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
They have ten trained specialists who regularly perform planning operations, checking nests, and sometimes saving operations.
The organization has set up even the Thare lands in Dumfies and Galloway, which is the 8 species of Scotland's bat species, as the first and only protected zone of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson, director of the region, says that the region is an ideal territory for them.
He said, “Here in Treve, we have a very good area for bats.”
“We have old buildings, many old trees and all suitable habitats.
But there are many things about bats that are still unknown, so what we do here and other areas will help us to understand what they need to grow.”
He emphasized the importance of checking for bats prior to performing repair operations in buildings as it may result in the destruction of a mother's nesting bat to kill up to 400 female and younger bats, which may lead to the destruction of a local population.
bats are protected and killing, harassing, and causing disruption to them and removing their nests is illegal.
Elisbeth Ferrell, responsible for Scottish association Bat Conservation Trust, urged the people to help with the serious.
“We still need to learn a lot about our bats and for many of our species, we still don’t know how their population continues.”
Ronaldo rejects rape claims, and lawyers follow the complaint of the German magazine seriously.
Christiano Ronaldo noted the rape claims against him as a “frequent story” and said that “people want to make their name famous by using his name.”
His lawyers are looking to complain about the German News magazine Der Spiegel, which has published these claims.
The attacker was accused of raping an American woman Kathryn Mayorga in one of the Las Vegas hotels in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he then paid $375,000 to keep him silent about the incident.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo, who had been talking to his 142 million followers for a period of time after the claims were reported.
No, no, no, no, no.
He who won the gold ball five times a day said to the camera, “What they said today was fake news.”
“They want to make themselves famous by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but this is part of my work.”
The player added a smile: “I am a happy person and everything goes well.”
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to complain about the De Spiegel’s claim that it is called “unprecedented statements of unconfirmed information in the privacy area.”
The Christian lawyer Schertz said that the player was looking for instincts to “examine the attractiveness of this illusion, which is probably one of the most serious violations that have been carried out in the field of individual rights in recent years.”
The event is said to have occurred on June 2009 in Sony at the Hotel and Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
The report reported that according to the documents of the Regional Court of Clark, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room after meeting in the nightclub and claimed that Ronaldo had raped him.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo came to the knees after this, and told him that he was “99 percent” a good “good” and had a bad “one”.
The document claims that Ronaldo has confirmed that the two had sex, but said the relationship was satisfied.
Mayorga also claimed he had gone to the police and taken pictures of his surgeons in the hospital, but later agreed outside the court because he felt “blaming” and worried about “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman says she is now looking for the deal because of the ongoing mental injury of the incident.
At the time of this claim, Ronaldo was placed on the threshold of the separation of Manchester United and joined the Madrid Ree, and this summer it was joined in a 100 million euro agreement to the Italian team of Ionus.
Brexit: The loss of automakers in England will follow the “ permanent regret”.
The UK Trade Minister Greg Clark said that if the UK lost its position as a global leader in automakers, it would be “depending on their constant regret.”
He added: “It’s a “comployer” that the UK unit tweeted to BBC if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily suspend production in the Brenaston factory near Derby.
Mr Clark said, “We need a deal.”
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays if a deal is not agreed could end at the price of loss of jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Auris and Avenues Toyota - has produced about 150,000 cars last year, about 90% of which have been exported to other EU countries.
Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston, said, “My vision is that if the UK gets out of the EU at the end of March without an agreement, we will be witness to the stop production in our factory.”
Other U.S. automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how to do foreign trade.
For example, BMW says a month after Brexit will close its Mini Production Plant in Oxford.
The main concern about what automakers say is related to the risks of supply chain if exiting without an agreement.
The Toyota production line operates based on the principle of “right-to-time”, as parts of each 37 minutes from the UK and the European Union come to the factory to make cars based on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, it may cause disruption on borders that the industries say could lead to delays and lack of parts.
The Toyota Company said it would be impossible for us to maintain our inventory in the Derbyshire factory as much as one day, and so the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said the Ms. Francis May plan for future relations with the European Union “is designed to prevent these problems on the border.”
\"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal so that as I say, let's not only succeed now but also allow us to use this opportunity.\"
“The fact that not only came from Toyota but also other manufacturers said we should be able to fully continue using this successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long the production would stop, but warned that in the long run these additional costs could reduce factory competitiveness and eventually lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and was responsible for the Union call, said that the concerns of the union members are rising: “By the experience that I have when these jobs are destroyed, they will never be reborn.
A government spokesman said, “We need to make a detailed and reliable plan for our future relationships with the EU.”
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again.
The White House said on Sunday that, with an ongoing controversy about the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, a high-risk meeting with President Donald Trump, with the vice general president of Rod Rosenstein might be \"there's another week to be delayed.\"
Rosenstein oversees the performance of the Special Consultant Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s involvement in elections and the relationship between Russia and Trump’s assistance and possible prevention of the president from doing justice.
Whether Trump will expel the general prosecutor’s vice president or threaten Mueller’s independence, in recent months, it has led to the formation of rumors in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had a microphone to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of the President's determination to reform the 25th.
Rosenstein rejected this report.
But last Monday, despite reports about his resignation, he went to the White House.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was at that time in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would not “get out” Rosenstein, but the meeting was timed to prevent him from intervening with the Senate judicial committee, in which Kacaana and Dr. Christine Blizzy Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered FBI to take a week to investigate the subjective claims against Kavaana, and thus further delays in the court vote.
Sarah Sanders, vice president of Trump's press, attended Sunday at the Fox News app
When he was asked about the meeting of Rosenstein, he answered: “The theory is not determined for this issue, it could be this week, according to other issues that are going on in the Supreme Court, it may be possible to delay another week.
But let’s see what’s going on and I’d always like to give the latest news to the press.
Some reporters do not agree with him: Sanders has not held a White House press meeting since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked the program for the reason.
Sanders said that the lack of information presented about these meetings is not due to the lack of attention to television reporters, although he said, “I’m not opposed to the fact that they are looking for media attention.”
Then he suggested an increase in Trump’s direct call and the press.
“The President holds more questions and answers to the previous president,” and added without further evidence: “We’ve looked at those numbers.”
The session is still presented, but if the press has the opportunity to speak directly to the president.
We’re trying to take these meetings further and you’ve seen a lot of such meetings in the past weeks and when you can talk to the U.S. president, such meetings will take place in the press meetings.”
Trump responds to questions when leaving the White House or when participating in free meetings or press conferences along with senior officials.
The independent press conferences rarely happen.
The president in New York this week may have shown the reason for this, and he has appeared freely and bizarrely against the crowd of reporters.
The Minister of Health of the European Union calls the EU employees at the National Institute of Amendment Health and Health Scotland on the concerns available on Brexit.
In a letter to EU staff working in the National Institute of Health and Treatment of Scotland, the Minister of Health expressed appreciation for their country and has hoped for them to stay in the post-Soviet phase.
Jean Freeman wrote a letter from the Scottish Parliament, saying it remains less than six months until the British withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has pledged to pay the expenses for the application of the final conditions related to EU citizens working in weakened public services organizations.
Mrs. Friman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union about the withdrawal of the agreement are going to be the way to the anticipated decisions that will be made in the fall.
However, the UK government is also increasing its readiness for a non-compulsory scenario.
I know it should be a very sad time for you.
That’s why I want to emphasize how much I value their nationality for each member now.
Our colleagues across the EU and even outside of it bring valuable experiences and skills, which will strengthen and improve the health service area and benefit patients and communities I serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we’re very concerned that you’re going to stay here.”
Christine Beerbromley goes to his head after the emergency surgery.
According to Mike Argan from Tennessee, Christine Schromley, the support defender of the Tince St. Tigrez team after the head area was defeated on Saturday 31-27, against Wenderbilt Kömdordez, a emergency surgery.
Rodd Seremie Tinsett told reporters that the damage had occurred a few minutes before midnight.
He said, “He came on the line, and then the earth fell.”
The coaches and medical staff gave him more tests to the side of the oxygen before placing the acronyms on the Brencar and moving him to perform further examinations.
A official official from Tincy Stits to Chris Harris from WSMV Network in Neil, Tinsey said smallpox surgery was over at the Wendderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added: “There is no details about the type and extent of injury, and Tennessee is trying to figure out when this injury has happened.
Aquarromic, a second year athlete, is spending its first season with Tennis Stite after transferring from Illinois.
He had five complete keys on Saturday before he left the game, which brought the number of seasons to 18.
Foreign buyers suffer more payments when buying property in the Kingdom of the United States
Foreign buyers in the United Kingdom will suffer further unemployment costs, and additional costs will be spent helping homeless cover new plans.
This will neutralize the success of the Keerbin plan to attract young voters.
The price of a tax stamp will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury Department predicts that this amount increases to 120 million dollars a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are ordered to pay more taxes when buying property in the Kingdom of the United States – and the amount of surplus is received to help the homeless, the news that Traza will announce today.
This move is an effort to neutralize the success of Jeffim Corbin’s success to attract young voters by promise to offer cheaper housing and target people with higher income.
The rise of tax stamp is applied to individuals and companies who don’t pay taxes, and the amount of money of this plan will help the government move to fight the sleep-depriving problem.
This additional cost – which is available on the fee of tax stamp, and includes higher tax rates stated two years ago on second houses and rented houses, will be up to three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts that the move will earn up to 120 million pounds per year.
Nearly 13 percent of London’s newly constructed homes are purchased by residents outside the United Kingdom, which increases prices and hardens the buying conditions for the first house.
Many countries – especially in the capital – have become “the city of souls” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside of the country.
This new policy began just a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke of a tax stamp to help young people get home.
He accused large construction companies to raise property prices by using land property, and asked Mrs. McMi to leave the most cheap homes to provide property in the UK.
Mr. Kerbin has provided a series of interesting offers for housing reforms, which include home rental control and end up evacuating without fault-free evacuation.
He also wants to give the city councils more options to build new houses.
“I said last year that I will give Prime Minister priority to restore the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.

Jack Ross: “My high flight is Scotland’s management.”
Jack Ross, president of Sanderland, said, “The height of his flight is to become the president of Scotland in the future.
The 42-year-old Auskat enjoys the restoration of the North-Kazakh Club, which is currently in dispute with three points of the top of the table in the third ranking of the league.
After he re-directed St. Miller’s past season to the Premier League, he moved to the light stadium this summer.
“I wanted to play for my country like a player.”
Ross said to BBC sports radio, “I’ve got the B degree, just that.”
“But I grew up with my father watching Scotland in your neighborhood, and that’s what always attracts me.
“However, this opportunity only comes to the person when I succeed in the club management.”
As directors of Sanderland, David Lees, Sam Alardis, Martin-Iniel, Rinten, Vegas Powell, and Paulo Diano.
The former head of the Alva Atlantic Club said he had no fear of such valid names that were looking for this large club, and had previously rejected the proposals of Barneski and Epsic.
“Now, the criteria for me is ‘Can I bring this team back to the Premier League?’
He said that because of the structure and possibilities of this club, he would undoubtedly belong to the Premier League.”
“It’s not easy to get a team back to the Premier League, but if I can bring back the team, I’ll succeed myself.”
Ross, after passing a course as a head assistant in Dambarton and 15 months of Hart Coaching, he is only three years in the management area.
He then turned them back to the third table by preventing the collapse of the Alva team and turned the following chapter of St. Maby from a team on the threshold of the fall to the winner as a hero.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than when he played in the Kleid teams, Hartelpo, Freck, St. Miron, and the Hamilton Academy.
He learned that “this was perhaps a real turning point.”
I certainly believed that the right management was me, much more than playing.
It seems strange because I was good, I made a good life for myself and enjoyed a high social position.
But playing can be difficult.
There’s a lot you need to do during the week.
I’m still running stress and stress, but I feel that management is very good for me.
I always wanted to manage and now do it, it’s the best feeling I’ve ever felt in my soul during my adult life.”

Summer heat wave has increased sales of British greenhouses, but has brought a lot of pressure on chain restaurants.
Statistics show that the group of greenhouses and many times saw an increase of 2.7 percent of sales in July, but the sale of restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business adviser who has been responsible for collecting statistics, said: “The sun is continuing and long-term participation in the UK’s World Cup means that July follows a similar pattern than in June before, when homes have increased to 2.8 percent of sales, expect that restaurants will have a tougher impact.
The sale of restaurants in June was worse in July.
Houses that served drink and often had a stronger performance than they had in most restaurants that saw a reduced sales.
Houses that eat food also suffered from heat, but not too much for restaurants.
People seem to just go out to drink.
Among homes and drinks were increased to 6.6 percent during this month, and the sale of food was reduced by three percent.
Paul Leyman, an analyst for welfare and guest RSM, said: “These results indicate the ongoing process we’ve seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales outside the home market, the weather and the impact of major sports and social events are the most important factors.
It’s no surprise that the restaurant group is still in conflict, of course, a sales reduction of 4.8 percent per year due to the ongoing increase in costs that exist will be much more painful.
This warm and long summer could not come in worse than this time for selling food, and it will determine if the cold air we experienced in August will provide a very long-term deadline for these jobs.”
The increase in sales of all greenhouses and restaurants, in addition to new installations, was 2.7 percent in July, which showed a reduction in the supply of new products to the market by large commercial brands.

Ads related to breast pumps compared to cows have caused a doubledom in online opinion.
A breast pump company by promoting milk mothers’ comparison with cows whose milk is showered, has created a double hand in online opinion.
Elvie’s consumer technology company, for the introduction of what is called the world’s first low-smoking pump, published a funny video to inspire ad-inspired to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers milk.
Four real mothers in a warehouse full of cow-filled straws dance with music: \"Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see anything,\" and \"If you don't pay attention, they're not cows, these are my breasts.\"
He said, \"Well, I'm giving him milk, I'm giving him milk, I'm showering the women's milk.\"
However, this promotion, which was published on the Facebook page, has caused a conflict in the virtual space.
The video received various responses from the viewers with 770,000 visits and hundreds of comments, many said it would take the \"hurt\" of the dairy industry.
“The use of cow to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
He wrote, like us, they should also be pregnant and bring the baby to produce milk, except that their children are stolen a few days later.”
Elvie breast pump is hidden in the nurses/mothers (Elvie/other).
Another person said: “In a sense of pride for the mother and the baby.
But why should we not use them to promote your breast pump for mothers who keep their children?”
Another person added: “What is an indestructible promotion.”
Some have supported the promotion, like a woman who claimed to be a “sound” song.
“I think it’s a silly idea.
If I gave my child a milk again, I’d wish I had a tea.
Pumping made me feel like I'm a cow.
It was a little silly, but I accepted it as it was.
Personally, it's a smart product.
Another person said, “It’s an interesting advertisement, and it’s a mother’s audience that pumps their milk (often at work or in the bathroom), and it feels like a “go”.
It’s not a advertisement for praise or judgment of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they all moved with hidden pumps in their breasts.
The concept behind this promotion is based on insight that most women who pump their milk say they feel like beef.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely noiseless, no wire or tube, and is hidden in the chest and gives women freedom of movement, keeping babies, and even going out when pumping.
Anna High School co-author and psychologist of children's growth in the mother's organization said Elvie pump is like a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and controversial introduction.
With the imageing of our pesticides of women and milk cows, we wanted to expose your breast pumps and all its challenges, and at the same time, in a fun and understandable way of freedom that these pumps will bring.
It’s not the first time that Elvie Tier’s pump has been reported.
During the week that London fashion was held, the mother of two children appeared on the fashion scene while using this product for the fashion designer Marta Yakobokovsky.
Hundreds of immigrant children were transferred to camp in the border of Texas.
Although the statistics related to illegal passage from the relatively fixed border, the number of migrants detained has increased, part of which is due to the harsh policies of the Trump administration, which has made it harder to find support for children.
Most of their own supporters had no legal evidence, so they were afraid to risk the country by taking a step to support their children.
When federal authorities announced that possible supporters and adult families should be fingerprinted, and that information was shared with the immigration authorities increased the risk.
Last week, Matthew Albins, a senior immigration and customs agency in Congress, testified that the agency has arrested thousands of people who have registered for support for children.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of people who were arrested had no previous criminal record.
Mr. Albenes said: “At least 80 percent of the people who have been backed or supported or had a family of supporters remain illegally in the country and many of them are foreign criminals.
We’re following those people.”
According to the shelter staff, in order to accelerate the process of handling children, officials announced new laws that, instead of the previous standard that made the presence in the court 60 days after the arrest, some of these children are required to attend the court for a month after the arrest.
Instead of personal presence, to defend themselves to take the legal residence status against a immigration judge through the video of the conference.
Those who are not eligible for legal protection are quickly fired.
According to shelter workers and reports obtained from the system in recent months, the more children are imprisoned, the more at risk of stress and anxiety, which can lead to violence or action.
The fans said that concerns in larger centers such as Trento, where the symptoms associated with the problem of a child may be ignored because of the large size of the center.
They added that the transition of children to tent cities without providing them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can make a dramatic impact that many are struggling with right now.
Syria ordered the US, France, and Turkey to get out immediately.
The Foreign Minister of Syria stated in his speech in the United Nations General Assembly that despite the war in the country in its eighth year, he asked the refugees to return to their homes.
The teacher who also owns the Prime Minister’s letter, said foreign forces are illegally fighting terrorism in Syria, and it will be appropriate to deal with them.”
He said to the assembly, “They must leave the country as soon as possible.”
The teacher stressed that in Syria, “war against terrorism has almost ended,” the war in which more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said, “We will continue to clear the holy war until we clear all the areas of Syria from terrorist groups and the presence of any foreign illegal force.”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly to train and provide advice to the forces, and the Arab Syrian opposes President Bashar Assad.
France has more than 1,000 land forces fighting in a country.
In the case of refugees, the teacher said that the conditions were appropriate for their return, and accused some Western countries of creating a rational fear that would cause the refugees to stay away from Syria.
He said, “We have asked international communities and humanitarian organizations to provide the facilities of this return.”
They've made a matter that's just a human-friendly subject to a political issue.
The United States and the European Union warned that as long as there is no agreement between Assad and the opposing forces to end the war, there will be no help to rebuild Syria.
The UN diplomats say about the recent agreement between Syria and Turkey that a Hail region was built in the most important region of the rebellion base in Adlib, which has made an opportunity for political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the widespread attacks of Syrian-backed forces to the local where three million people live.
However, the teacher stressed that the agreement is “a certain term” and hopes that military operations will target jihades, which include al-Qaeda-dependent fighters.
Stephen Demoria, the UN representative, hopes to form the first meeting of the new committee of government and members of the opposition party to write a draft of the constitution after the war for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
The teacher explained the situation of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying that the worker should be limited “to investigate the constitutional material” and warned of interference.
Why Trump will win a long time.

The chaos has a value of entertainment.
Just like nothing else in TV, you’ll have stories that come out of Washington against the future, whether immigrant families can be together again and determine the health of the global economy.
It’s a matter of ignoring the only ones who have special privileges.
And yet, when you find out that 6 hours are watching a group of expert debates about the use of the “deep background” for the book “The Fear” Bob Woodard, the pilot character of the camel’s leather podium $15,000,” a kind of dress with a thick cover,” according to Washington Post, and the secret meanings in the harsh description of Dannys from Mr. Trump’s anatomy, the issue goes far beyond an informed citizen.
As a person, I will no longer look at Super Mario as before.
The CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the “Stars in the hills” about changing the day-to-day changes of the plan (the way to go with the American Football League, Jong An) said Trump’s TV show “a portion of what he does to make a real show feel, is that every night he’s giving you something.”
You can’t lose a part, so you’ll stay behind.
When I met Mr. Philis this week, the air outside was 80 degrees Fahrenheit, but he was watching MSNBC inside and still recording the CN program.
He couldn’t feel that he couldn’t worry about Bertcaana, who had been forced to face the Parliament’s judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court of the country, which was unknown.
Mr. Philis told me, “I remember when we made those ridiculous shows in the past, people said, ‘This is a beginning to end Western civilization.’
“I thought it was kind of joke, but it seemed right to them.”

The sources of money from abroad became the toughest elections between the internal era.
It’s no wonder that the 17th zone of Pennsylvania, thanks to the merger of the region, has a congressional representative, which made the competition of two competitors on a chair, will see the collapse of the money itself.
This has recently led to the reconstruction of the Democratic Party’s region in the outskirts of the city of Pittsburgh.
The Lamb is competing with another election rival, the Republican Rutfus, who has recently been the candidate of the 12-year-old Pennsylvania region, and the area is interfering with the 17 new area.
These plans were changed after that, which was divided in January by the Supreme Court of the Old Region against the constitution and unfairly in favor of Republicans.
The competition in the new area led to the heavy competition of large parties’ financial branches, between the Democratic Congress Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name of the Lamb follows a close competition and a victory in a special election held in March for the 18th Congress region and many of the people witnessed it became the head of the languages.
The chair was run by the Republican Party for a decade, and Donald Trump won 20 points in the region.
Political experts looked at Democrats.
The U.S. has stopped the amount of al-Salvador penalty to support China at that time.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had now accepted Beijing by a little distance from Washington.
Mr. Trump met President Juan Carlos Varla in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until Sherka fired Trump's management team.
Heder Notret, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs in early this month, said that foreign officials decided to call senior U.S. officials from El Salvador diplomatic missions, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the recent “determination to support Taiwan”.
But the punishment was only applied to El Salvador, who received financial aid to control drugs, development and financial support from Americans about $140 million.
The proposed punishment, which included a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions, had a painful effect on the Central American country and high unemployment rates and the number of murders taken.
With the arrival of domestic meetings, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to participate in a similar gathering of the past year, which was a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, senior government officials clearly announced that they want to continue to find a conference, to effectively end any review of al-Salvador penalty.
Diplomats said it was planned to take place to Mike Pence, Vice President, at this conference, which is scheduled to be held in mid-October, to make a statement that represents the importance that the government has made for this meeting.
And three U.S. ambassadors quickly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any news of serious warnings and punishment from Washington.
Three U.S. officials, two of whom are diplomats and agreed to stay anonymous about internal negotiations, said Mr. Bolton's White House spokespersoned on the details of the discussion described by three American officials.
Their description was confirmed by an external analyst close to the government to remain anonymous.
Study History
The next inevitable event could be a report by Robert Mueller, a special advisor, about the possible prevention of Trump in law enforcement, with sufficient evidence and evidence in this case in public awareness.
According to Mr. Mueller, his investigations to whether Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia has been about attacking our elections.
If Congress changes its side, Mr. Trump is right when he prepares himself for a meeting with voters, to answer Congress and perhaps eventually see a jury of his counterpart.
Of course, but if it's too much, and I don't mean that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, we all have to make decisions that will be effective in how long this will take place.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out the coup against Hitler, only enough to resist the West and support the Slovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to prevent many years of mass murders that followed.
The path of history of such milestones rotates and accelerates or accelerates unstoppable competition.
Americans are facing several such milestones.
What will we do if Mr. Trump, vice president of the general prosecutor, General Reed Rosestenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble after the release of the news in the year prior to his fiancée to capture the secret of the president's conversations and commenting on Trump's inappropriate personality for the president.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is not accurate.
“What will we do if the new FBI research is not perfect or fair from Bert Kacaana – or, despite the fact that the charges against sexual aggression and false testimony to the Supreme Court?
And most importantly, we vote for a Congress that responds to Mr. Trump in the elections between the course?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will go to winter sleep.
But I believe we won't fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was moved to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied my ambassador's home.
He was alive, moved to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to explain the secrets that the Nazi cross had been exposed to.

concerns about the retirement savings have been stolen from women's eyes.
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of them, some of them were talking about it with their families.
About half of the people of this study said they were talking to their wives about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this.
Haley Schneider, vice president of the insurance firm, said, “People want to take care of one of their family members, but they don’t go ahead to talk.”
This is where we need to start from.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don’t specify your wishes at the right time, you can’t prepare your family for care.
Talk to your legal advisor and family about location and how to get care, as this election can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Help your financial advisor: Financial advisor can help you find a solution to pay for expenses.
Your financial choices for long-term care can include common long-term insurance, or life insurance based on the value of money to cover these costs or self-determination with your wealth – as long as you have money.
Give your legal evidence: You will be successful in legal battles.
Prepare a health care course to determine a reliable person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals will agree with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, take into account the use of the letter in financial cases.
You choose a sure person to make your financial decisions and make sure that the bills are paid if you don’t have the ability to.
Don’t forget small details: Imagine that your old father or mother needs a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the drugs he has used and the sensitivity he has?
Bring details to the piece on the paper, so that you can be ready.
Mr. Martin said: “It’s not just financial issues, but who are doctors, too?
What drugs are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Keep this in mind.”

Federal prosecutors looking for a rare death penalty for the New York terrorist attack
The New York Federal Court is looking for the death penalty for the Pyropopo, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that was not implemented for federal crimes since 1953.

According to the criminal declaration of the death penalty recorded in the southern part of New York, in order to wave the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Picato has killed eight victims, and \"exceedly\" them with serious physical injuries.
According to court documents, both of them have the possibility of obtaining the death sentence.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal jury accused Pyropo of 22 criminal charges, including eight cases of murder through the aid of trafficking, the criminal who is commonly used by federal prosecutors to refer to organized crimes and accused of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors said that the attack would require “a lot of planning and design” and that in describing what Pyropo had done, his practice was “instructual, aggressive, and misleading.”
In the declaration of the crime, God, Habibullah Uychio, has caused injury, injury, and death of members of the family and friends of Digo Angelini, Nicolas Claudia, Darret, Darin, Ale Argi, Haran Ferchi, Hernan Digo Mendoza, and Elkhanovian Dame Pagnoko.
Five of the victims were from Argentina’s tourists.
A decade of the last death penalty in the southern area of New York.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two sales items, but was sentenced to prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in the New York federal case was in 1953 and for Julius and Etl Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being sentenced to spying for the Soviet Union two years before the Cold War.
Both were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court cases, Pyropo, which is the native of Uzbekistan, did not repent during the days and months after the attack.
The police said he had a good feeling of what he did.
According to the report, Pewo told the authorities that the motivation was created after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police also stated that he was also asked to bring the ISIS flag to the hospital.
He has made an innocent statement about 22 perpetrators.
David Pattone, one of the federal public defenders who took up the Viktor Yapoo, said they “really disappointed the decision of the prosecutor.”
“We think that the decision to impose death penalty instead of agreeing to the criminal’s claim of punishment for imprisonment will never be possible without the possibility of freedom only to strike the spirit of these events for those who were suspected to be longer.
The Picato Defense Team had previously asked the prosecutor to not seek the death penalty.
Parliament's Conservative Party says the New Zealand should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Angel Faraj pledged to move “people’s attack today in protest of the conservative party’s conference.
Former Yukup leader said politicians should “flee with the pressure of close opposition between the United Kingdom and the European Union,” as one member of the Parliament of Traza proposed that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bon, a member of the House of Representatives of the House of Commons, said to Limamans in Lembey, that if Mr. Faj D. Brexit, the UK had already been out.
But the challenge with which Ms. Ms. Mém is faced by the British Conservative Party groups who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to pursue an unaccompanied exit map among the Brexit supporters, the remaining supporters in the EU and the EU.
The allies insisted that he would try to make a deal with Brussels despite extreme reactions – and force the opposition forces close to the United Kingdom and the European Union and the Labour Party to choose between his proposed package or 'herry'.
To leave the community, Mr. Bonn, who was held in Sobyhol, said that he wanted to “speak the exit plan without an agreement.”
He proposed that Mr. Faraj should be considered colleagues for the responsibilities given to Brussels talks.
He said, “If he had the responsibility, we would have been out.”
\"I'm going to stand for Brexit, but we need to stop the exit plan without an agreement.\"
While opposed to the European Union, he said: “We’re not going to fight in world wars until we fall down.
We want to set our own rules in our own country.”
Mr. Bonn rejected the fact that public opinion has changed since 2016. “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and that they want to remain in Europe is completely false.”
The blessing of Andrea Agenkins, a member of the Conservative Party, was also on the march, and he said to the reporters: “It’s easy to say: Prime Minister! Listen to the people.
The withdrawal does not have a popular agreement on the public, the opposition will not vote, our party and our political activists, who actually operate in the streets, and will lead us to choose as a representative, are not interested in this plan.
Please leave the plan without an agreement and start listening.
He added in a message to Mrs. Ms. Ms. Prime Ministers keep their position when they fulfill their promises.
Fayage told the marchers that if policymakers were to make a decision that was taken in February 2016, they should be forced to “press”.
He said, “Now this is about trust between us, the people and the political class.”
They want to betray Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, but we’re here today to tell them, “We don’t let you go the palace.”
In a message to the crowd, he added: “I want you to form our political group, so that those who are at the brink of betrayal from the European Union are under pressure.
“We take the army of the people of this country, which will win our victory out of the European Union, and we will never relax until we have an independent, independent English, self-destructive and deficiencies.”
At the same time, the rest of the EU’s supporters have been walking in the backyard before holding a two-hour gathering at the city center.
After the conservative group began working against Brexit since the end of the week, a small number of activists brought this party to hytz.
Lord Adenis, a member of the Labour Party, was ridiculed at the same time at the beginning of the conference for the security issues of a party program.
“These are the people who tell us that they can install IT systems and can provide all the necessary technology for Canada plastics to have free border, for free trade without border in Ireland.”
This is quite a joke.
He said there was nothing called a good British withdrawal from the European Union.

The Russian Grand Prix: After the team won the Hillary Conference on Sebastian Westt, the Cases became a closer step closer to the world.
On Saturday, from the moment that Walter Bocas turned out to be from Louis Hamilton, it was clear that the Mercedes team would play a lot.
Botos had a good start from the first line and was almost completely separated from Hamilton to defend his position in the first two miles and allowed him to attack his team.
Well, it was the first person to enter Pete Stone and let Hamilton find out in the traffic of the last cars, something that was definitely happening.
Mercedes came to Pete Strap and appeared on the back of Walt, but Hamilton was very close to the vehicle after a few movements because the escape driver was separated from the middle of the road, and after a double movement, he bought the third place to John.
Max Vestapen began the race back row, and at the age of 21, he was seventh at the end of his first round.
Then at most of his race, he was the first person, and he didn't replace his rubbers because he wanted to get to the finish line quickly and take over the rhythm of Ryconn and become the fourth.
In the end, he finally entered Pitchup in the 40th and fourth round, but he was not able to increase his speed in the eight-distance remaining, and Rikiken became the fourth.

Helton said the team had done an exceptional job that had two winners.”
The non-invasive connection was really bad.
On Saturday, President Donald Trump fooled Diane Finstein on an election gathering because of his insisting on the lack of the content of Christine Bellis Ford’s letter on the charge of sexual rape of Bret Kadana, the candidate of the Supreme Court.
The president, who was speaking in Western Virginia, spoke directly of the testimony of Ford at the Senate judiciary, but also said that what is happening in the Senate, shows how much people are “clean, dirty and lying.”
“What could happen in the Senate and what was beautiful happened over the past few days is that when you see anger, you see people who are nervous, dirty, and lying.”
“They spread and spread, and then say, ‘Oh, I haven’t done it.’
“I haven’t done that.”
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, have you disclosed this?
Remember his answer, did you shake the document? \"Oh, oh, what are you saying?\"
\"Oh, no.
“I haven’t disclosed it.”
So, wait a minute.
He added similar to an Senator who said, \"Have we disclosed the news? No, we haven't done it.
They have sent a letter to Finestin, in the last July, forcing charges against Kavana, and the contents of this letter have been revealed in early September – but Fenstein denied that the disclosure of his office was taken out.
I haven’t concealed the charges of Dr. Ford, I haven’t disclosed his issue,” it’s part of the report on the announcements of Finnstein at the committee.
“He asked me to keep this secret, and I did it as he wanted.”
But his denial of the president wasn’t convincing, and he criticized him during the Sunday convention: “I tell you what’s really happening, the problem was really bad.”
Maybe he didn’t do it, but it’s the worst non-anonymous connection I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court’s candidate, who accused him of sexual abuse, stated that Democrats used charges for their benefit.
“They are determined to take power from every way.
The President said that he said, “You see corruption, it doesn’t matter who they are hurt and who they are being rejected to power and to have the right to do things.”

John's air traffic controller saved hundreds of people on the plane to escape the earthquake.
Indonesia's people were responsible for controlling air traffic due to their fate for the safe flight of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
In China, a large earthquake on the island of Slevus, and under that tsunami, more than 800 people were killed and the number of civilians was missing.
The storms have still disrupted life in the region, and many people are trapped under the Palo.
But despite his colleagues fled to preserve their lives, Antonio Gangu, 21 years old, left his post at the control tower that was heavily shaken at the airport of Muira Sis Al Jofrey in Palau.
He stayed there to make sure that the 6321 ballistic air flight, which was at the time on the band, could be extended.
And then, when you see the tower is breaking down, they move out.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
According to a report by the New York Australia, UNICEF, Indonesian Airways spokesperson said the decision saved hundreds of people's lives.
We prepared helicopters from Balıkesir in Kaliman to take him to a greater hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the plane reaches the pallet.
He added: “We failed to hear this news.”
At the same time, authorities are concerned that the number of deaths will reach thousands of people, and the natural disaster management agency says access to the cities of Duangala, Sigi, and Bouung.
The agency's spokesman, Sukopo Porterno, said, \"We think the death figures will rise again, because many crimes are still unarmed, and access to many of them may not be possible.\"
The waves whose height reached six meters are turning the polo into soil, and on Sunday the mass funeral will be held in the city.
Military and commercial aircraft also helped themselves and the minority.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, said to Skyy News, “Every minute an ambulance comes from the ghetto.”
Healthy water is low.
“They steal small shops everywhere.”
In Indonesia, John Goldand said to CNN: “The Indian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we don’t know what will happen there.
It’s a sad thing, but it could be much worse.”
On Sunday, President Joko and Lido arrived at Paulo, and told the country’s military forces: “Of all you want to work night and day to do things related to discharge.
Are you ready to do this?”
Earlier this year, a earthquake in Indonesia took over 550 people.
The collapse of the microsynthetic plane: The Gigney plane company now says it has lost a man after the plane crashed in the lake.
The plane, which fell in a lake in the Pacific, is now a missing man after his previous comments on safe departure of all 47 passengers and crew of aircraft.
The Gigiini airline said it was missing after Saturday that one of the passengers had died.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals, and factories to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to questions about the exact information of this passenger, such as his age and nationality.
The plane has fallen into the water after trying to take emergency landing from the Karach Airport Band and local boats have been helped to save passengers and crew.
On Friday, the authorities said seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline said the six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday, and the status of them all remained stable.
The exact cause of the fall and order of the events is not yet known.
The U.S. Air and Marine Corporation both said the plane had fallen in the lake due to its shortfall.
Some witnesses believed the plane had gone out of the band.
The American passenger said the height of the plane was too low when landing.
Jeans said, “It was a very good thing.”
Jeans said he and others were able to sink in an airplane and walk in the water that would reach their waist and bring themselves to emergency exits.
He said that the guests were afraid, and were confused, and that he himself had taken a small surgeon from the area.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors who were working near the aircraft on the skim repair were forced by using a wind boat to rescue the people, and had taken about 30 feet (100 feet) to the beach before the plane was flooded.
The information from the Air Transport Safety Network has shown that 111 people have died in the fall of the Papawa-Ginn aircraft, but the statistics have not been included by the Chinese airline.
The analyst provided the nighttime chart where the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, a man who had been accused of dying alive was finished in 2014.
Paul Rott, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used phone reports to put charges on 29-year-olds, Kevin Tallis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers on the night of the incident.
According to Clarion Ler's report, Rott said he had obtained location information from a few mobile phones, which showed that Til was with him on the night of Chümbers' death, which accused him of a previous claim.
When the information showed that his phone was accompanied by Michel Sanford's friend, Kimbers, the police went to Sanford to interrogate.
Sanford stood in the place on Saturday and testified that it was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked him, “Is it true that this night he was in Sanford’s car?”
Another contradiction was that Telis said he had been familiar with him for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile reports showed that there was only one week of their familiarity.
Rott said that after the death of Chambers, Tilli has cleared messages, calls and chatters call information from his phone.
He said, “Tillis removed him from his life.”
The final meeting will be held on Sunday.
The judge said that the judgment would be given to the judge on that day.
Question: What is conscious hip hop?
A three-person group of hip hop music wants to challenge this kind of music by filling their music with positive messages.
The attack groups, from Brestol, claim that the hip hop was far from its principle that expressed political messages and paid social issues.
They want to bring this style of music back to their own principle and make the hip hop reinvigorate consciously.
Artists from music groups such as Fujis and Camen have recently seen artists like Akala and Loki have been reinventing music in the UK.
Another black again?
New York's nurse complains of a couple because they have been fired to him after sending a message from the \"Passionian\".
A New York-based nurse complained of a couple who had fired her for racist issues, because she had received a wrong message from the mother of the family, since the nurse has also been a black other skin.
These couples deny that they are racist, and consider their complaint to be apocalypse.
When the nurse went home for her first day in 2016, Lincio-Flexman, mother of two children, found that the newborn nurse, Lessel Morse, was black and felt worried.
Ms. Plastko-Flexman wrote in a message to his wife, “No way, I don’t want another black again.”
However, while sending this message to his wife, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After she noticed her mistake, Ms. Plyco Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, saying she had done a bad job while she was waiting for the Philippines’ nurse, according to the New York Post report.
One day, the cost of work was paid to Mrs. Morris and then sent her home with online taxis.
Now, Morris accused the couple to give him the damage, and he asked for $350 per day for six months without a contract, and had been hired for a certain period of time at his workplace.
He said on Friday, “I want to show them, so that they know, they don’t do things like this, and that I know this is discriminatory.”
The couple responded to the claim that they were racist, while they said his expulsion was a wise job because they thought he would no longer trust him after being insulted.
“I’m not going to send him a message and he doesn’t mean it.
He is not racist.
His husband, Joel Plasticko, said to New York News, “We are not racist.”
“But are you giving your child to someone you’ve made an excuse, even if you’ve done it wrong?”
Your newly born child?
You think.”
In a similar manner, Plyco said that his wife had two months of leave for the birth of his child and “was in a difficult position.”
The head of the investment bank added that “Do you want to look for a person like him?
His choice is not good.”
While this complaint is still happening, public opinion quickly condemns this couple in social media and strongly criticized them for their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that Pedington publishers have been concerned about the lack of communication with the bear.
Carneel, a band girl, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the book before the book is printed.
Knowing what we know today about the great success of Paddington is very interesting.
He says that his father had been happy about not accepting his book and added that his 60th anniversary of the release of the book after his father died in the past year.
He described Pedington as \"a very important part of our family\" and added that his father was totally proud of his final success.
He said, “My father was a very quiet man, and he was not a devout man.”
“But because Pedington was so real to him, it’s like you have a kid who gets something: you’re proud of him, though you haven’t actually done it.
I think he saw Pedington’s success like this.
Although Pedington created him and he was the son of his imagination, he always attributed the success of the effect to Pedington itself.”
My daughter was dead and I had to say goodbye to her behind the phone.
After the fall of her daughter, she was quickly transferred to the hospital of Paviar 2, but the doctor’s attempt to save her was useless.
Ms. Ednan-Pirth said, “My daughter is really bad, and she doesn’t think she’s going to continue.”
He said, “She will leave this world for two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.”
And I did that.
I said, \"I love you so much, dear.\"
Soon I will join you.
I will be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given him to keep his heart alive had little effect on him and went out of his body.
He was dead a few minutes before, and all his body members were out of work.
I just had to sit there and wait, and all this happened to me.
Because I was among other families and people, I couldn’t cry, scream or cry.
I really had to keep my peace.
In the end, Mrs. Ednan, Lapitz, who was now to lose her daughter, was riding along with other passengers – while he had forgotten the calamity she had brought to him.
He said, “No one knew.”
“I’ve thrown my head down, and I’ll pour tears.”
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt the pain I felt.
I needed my love and I needed to understand him.
I knew how much she loved him.
Pregnant women by installing cards on the bridge in an effort to prevent suicide of others.
Two women who have lost their loved ones for suicide are trying to prevent suicide from others.
Sharon Davis and general Hamfars have attached cards on his bridge that contain inspirational messages and telephone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he found depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
He said, “I don’t want families to experience the feeling I have every day.”
The 45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in New Guinea, said his son had a future chef who had a beautiful smile.
“They all knew him with their smile.
They always said his smile shines every house.
However, he left his job before he died, because his work was really dark.”
In 2014, Tiller's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the first to find his soul.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m worried that this would cause a bad effect on him.”
Mrs. Davis has made cards, “to tell people that there is someone who can ask or talk to him, even if he is a friend.
Don’t sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Hamfars, who has been friends with Mrs. Duis, lost Mark shortly after his mother died, who had been in contact with him for 15 years.
He said, “Mr. Clark didn’t say that he had a feeling of sadness or depression or something like that.”
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
The Christmas day was so depressed that when the children opened their gifts, they did not look at them or look at anything.”
Mark's death was a very heavy blow for them, but they had to go back: \"This is generally coming back to the family.
His grief kills us.
But we all have to live and fight hard.”

The Future of Bert Kavana with the start of the FBI Research
On Saturday, Mr. Fleley said, “I thought, if we could really do what he wants – research at a limited time, with a limited extent – perhaps we could reach a little bit of unity,” and he added, “if we could be afraid, between Ben Bleke without a party going out, the committee would “discover.”
Why did Mr. Kavana and his Republican supporters not want him to start the investigation?
Their hair is because of time.
Until November sixth election remains only five weeks, if, as expected, bad Republicans will act, their efforts to find a man who wants to choose for the Supreme Court will be severely undermined.
George D. W. Bush took the phone to call the Senators and remove them to support Mr. Kavanai, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife, who at the time was a personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI provides the report?
The Senate is voted, and now there are 51 seats in the Republicans and 49 seats in the Democratic Party.
It’s not clear whether Mr. Kavana can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, until Mike Pence, vice president, can give his vote and declare him the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean escapes under the Chinese government
A South Korean legislator said that since Kim Jong - that seven years ago, the number of North Korea's escapes has been reduced to South Korea.
Parking-Shog, quoted from the South Korean Union, had 1,127 asylum cases in the past year, seen a decline in 2011 compared to 2,706 refugees.
Mr. Park said that the more severe control of borders between North Korea and China and higher wages were the smugglers of people, including the most influential factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
Most refugees from North Korea are eventually granted South Korea’s citizenship.
After the end of the two Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 of North Korea have been illegally crossed the border.
Most people flee through China’s border because China has the longest border with North Korea, and it’s easier to pass through the civilian zone than the most protected area between the two Koreas.
China, the fugitives know illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often return them to their country in force.
Relationships between North and South Korea that continue to be in war have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and talked about nuclear weapons negotiations that were stopped.
This happened after the historic meeting between Donald Trump, the U.S. President and Kim Jong, he was in Singapore after the general agreement of the parties to break down the nuclear weapons of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, on Saturday, considered U.S. sanctions a lack of progress in nuclear negotiations since then.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ray said, “If we cannot trust the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security, and under such circumstances, we will never step forward and disarm ourselves.”
Nancy Pelosey says Bert Kavana is \"hysterian\" and is inconvenient for the Supreme Court's office.
Nancy Paulosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, called the Supreme Court’s candidate Bert Kavana “hysterian” and said he wasn’t in a way that he was not appropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
On Saturday, Pelosi expressed criticism in an interview at the Texas Tribunal Festival in Austin, Texas.
Plusey said on his response to Klauana’s testimony against the Senate judicial committee on Thursday: “I can’t listen to it, I think if a woman was doing so, they would call her “hysterian.”
Cacaana was emotionally accused of charges that when Christine Bladies Ford and she were both teenagers, she had raped her.
Kavana felt at the beginning of her talk, and when she talked about her family and high school years, she sometimes smiled and smiled.
He has also clearly condemned Democrats in the committee and made accusations against himself as “a personality character and coordinated” that liberals have organized it because of the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Plusey said, “The testimony of Kadana proved that he couldn’t serve in the Supreme Court because he showed that it was anti Democrats.
He said, “I think Kavana showed that he didn’t qualify for this job, and that he showed his lack of competence in the way he spoke about Clinton and Democrats.”
When it was asked by Paulo that if Kavana was selected, and if Democrats again have the majority of the House's representatives, he would try to protest against him or not, his answer would be negative.
“I’m saying this – if he doesn’t say the truth to Congress or FBI, then he’s not the right judge of the Supreme Court, nor the court that is currently working there.”
Kavana is now judged in the Washington Court of Reconciliation.
Paulo added that as a Democrat, he was worried about the possible oppositions issued by Kavana against the laws of affordable medical care or the law against Void (the nature of abortion) because he is a conservative judge.
Kavana went away from answering questions on whether he would make some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“It’s not time to go to court with a neurologist and expect us to say, ‘What’s interesting.’
Women need to manage their cry.
This is a bitter criticism, and instead, the months and years are filled with anger, and he can’t get rid of it without crying.
Ms. Ashtine, 45 years later, said to me, “When we are nervous, we cry.”
“I don’t think it’s unusual, isn’t it?”
He continued: “My mother, who was the manager, helped me a lot, and he told me that he was crying when he was nervous, but he created a technique, so that when he was nervous and crying, he says to the person who spoke to him, ‘I cry for sadness.’
I am angry.”
And then he continued to do so.
And I thought it was a very good technique.”
The tears are so much to get out of the feeling of anger because tears are basically wrong.
One of my most obvious memories of my first job in the office where the employees were more male, is when I cried because of severe anger, Mrs. Johnson took my neck – an unloved manager who always feared him a little – and drew me to the stairs.
He said to me, \"Never let them see your weeping.\"
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you are sad and happy because they are suffering you.
Patrickia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Congress of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart at the time of his presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart met a stranger on a boat called Manbykins, and left the competition in the election, Mrs. Schroeder, who was deeply disappointed, found that he did not have a reason to be a presidential candidate.
He said to me 30 years later, “It wasn’t a decision I thought about.”
\"There were seven other candidates in the presidential competition, and my candidate was the last thing he wanted.
One of them said, \"The White Perfume and the Seven Crows.\"
Because it was a campaign for China, and it was not time to collect funds, so it swore that it would not enter the competition up to $2 million.
The fight was a failure.
He realized that some of his supporters who gave him $1000 will give him just $250.
He was surprised and thought, “Do they think I’ll be discounted?”
When he began his speech and said that he didn’t start a formal campaign, he was so influenced by the emotions – from the people who helped him appreciate the system that had made it difficult to collect money and did not allow voters to be treated rather than representative, and was angry because of sexual discrimination – he felt angry because of the expression of these emotions.
Mrs. Schroeder remembers how the media reacted to him, “I think we have nerve disorder.”
“You thought Clinton was my financial support.”
I remember thinking what they want to write on my gravestone?
“She cried?”
How the U.S. and China Trade War may benefit Beijing.
Experts say it was the start-up bullets between the U.S. and China, and while it still lasts a lot of struggle, the difference between the two countries could be in favor of Beijing for a long time.
Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump warned by closing taxes on Chinese export goods, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Trade tensions between the two countries this week reached its peak by new tariffs on $200 billion (150 billion) goods, on half of the total import items from China to the United States.
Beijing has been embarrassed in a form against every time, from the last sample, which can be referred to as the five to ten percent of U.S. goods.
China has sworn to compete with the U.S. - step by step, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will soon flourish with these winds.
Backing Washington from a decision meant surrender to his demands, but for the president of China, Xi Jinping, he is very ashamed to express publicly against the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing can play right with his cards, the U.S. trade war pressure could have a positive effect over the long term by reducing the dependence between the two countries.
Abigail Gres, a research member working at the U.S. Security Center’s thought room on Asia’s issues, said the fact that a political decision by Washington or Beijing could create a situation that would cause economic collapse in any country, is much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged.”
The Syrian Foreign Minister says Syria is “a preparation” for refugees’ return.
Syria says it’s ready to return volunteers and ask other countries to rebuild it that has destroyed more than seven years of war.
When the Foreign Minister of Syria spoke at the UN General Assembly, He said the situation of his country would be better.
He said, “Today, thanks to the progress that took place in the fight against terrorism, the situation in Syria has become more stable and secure.”
The government is trying to rebuild areas that have destroyed terrorists and restore normal life to the country.
All conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country, which are prepared for terrorism and for the economic actions of one side that affect their daily life and their livelihoods.
According to the UN, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country by the beginning of the war since 2011.
Six million other people who still live in this country need humanitarian assistance.
The teacher said, “The Syrian regime welcomes aid to rebuild the country.”
But he added that he did not want legitimate aid, as well as the help of countries that supported Syria’s unrest.
Europe cuts the victory of Rocker Cap in Paris
With the failure of the U.S. team and winning the final score of 16.5 over 10.5, the European team won the national golf race outside of Paris in France.
The U.S. has now broken six consecutive times in Europe and has failed to win in Europe in Rocker Cap since 1993.
When Captain Danish gave Thomas Bourne the team a score of 14.5, which they needed to defeat the United States, Europe recaptured the captain of the championship.
The American astronomer Phil Michaelson, who worked hard for most of the race, struck the 16th-century hole with his hit, and admitted his defeat against Francis Molinari.
Molniari, Italian open golf appeared in all stages of the game, and one of the four players played since the present form of the race began in 1979.
The lower-ranking player of the European team, Truba Elson, removed from Denmark, the American Open Golfman Jordan Spat 5&4.
Damn Johnson, the world's top-ranking player with a score of 2 and 1 in front of Ian Poler than the UK, who plays in his last player.
Sergio Garashia, the old job of eight Rocker Cap, with 25.5 points in his field, has always won the most in European tournaments.
“I don’t normally cry, but today I can’t stop crying.
It was hard year.
Thank you so much for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so glad we got the captain back.
After the victory of Europe, Gabriela excitedly said, “It’s a team year, and I’m glad I could help.”
He spoke to John Ram’s fellow, who was able to defeat the American golf legend of the Woods on Sunday, with a score of 2 and 1.
Ram 23-year-old Ram said, “I feel so proud to defeat Tayri Woods, I grew up watching the game of this great man.”
Woods failed in every four matches in France, and now has a professional statistics of 13-21-3 for the Rocker Cap record.
It’s strange for someone who has always been the best players and after Jack Leess has gained 14 original titles.
The U.S. team tried the weekend to find places of short-finished lawns on the competition where Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finno are not there because these players played all of their talents and abilities in the whole race.
Jim Hitch, Captain America, said after his team’s disappointing performance, “I’m proud of these players, they fought.”
Today, we sometimes put pressure on the European team.
We've broken it.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We’ll be back together and I’ll work with the American Professional Golf Association and the Rocker Capman Committee and will move forward.
I love these 12 players and I am proud to be Captain.
You have to admire them.
They played better than us.
