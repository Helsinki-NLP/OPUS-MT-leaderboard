>>zsm_Latn<< Assembly members (AM) Welsh worried when they ‘seemed like muppets puppets'.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are concerns among some AMs against a sugesti that their designations should be changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/ Members of the Welsh Parliament).
>>zsm_Latn<< This arises because there is a plan to rename the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
>>zsm_Latn<< AMs throughout the political spectrum are concerned if it can invite a greeting.
>>zsm_Latn<< An AM party of the labor said that his group was concerned, -But it was a rifle with Twp and Pwp-
>>zsm_Latn<< For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirt.
>>zsm_Latn<< A member of the assembly (AM) said that his group as one union, felt - displeased - and had proposed several alternatives.
>>zsm_Latn<< A Welsh Conservative says that his group - thinking open - to the change of names, but assessing that this is a dismissal of abbreviation of MWP stands to Muppet.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced like a u in Yorkshire English.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Assembly Commission which currently compiles the law to introduce the change of the name, says: ← The final ruling on any explanation of the designations for AMs is certainly a problem for the members themselves-
>>zsm_Latn<< The Government's 2017 decision empowered the Wales Assembly to change its name.
>>zsm_Latn<< In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on known proposals obtaining extensive support to call the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
>>zsm_Latn<< Regarding the problem of naming the AM, the Commission prefers WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Welsh Parliament Members), but MWP options gain the most support on public consultations.
>>zsm_Latn<< The AM seems to submit an alternative option, but the struggle to achieve consensus could turn the chairman, Elin Jones expected to submit the draft of the change law within a few weeks.
>>zsm_Latn<< This reform law would include other changes about the way the assembly works, including discualification rules for AMs and committee systems plans.
>>zsm_Latn<< The AM will get a final sound regarding the question of how they should be called when they discuss the laws.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Macedonian society went to give a voice to the referendum regarding the change in the country's name
>>zsm_Latn<< The voice owners will determine whether their country's name will be changed to -the Northern Macedonian republics of Macedonia'
>>zsm_Latn<< The poll was held in an attempt to resolve disputes for a decade with the Greek neighboring country, which also had a province named Macedonia.
>>zsm_Latn<< Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighboring country shows a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected the membership offer of the European Union and NATO.
>>zsm_Latn<< Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, a voter for a name change, had said that he would ignore the vote.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, supporters of referendums, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the change of the name was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
>>zsm_Latn<< St.Martin's bells were not critical when the Churches in Harlem were having difficulties
- Historically, the old people I'm talking about once say there's a bar and a church in every corner, - Mr. Adam said
>>zsm_Latn<< ← Today, there is not one-
>>zsm_Latn<< He said that the disappearance of all the bars could be made known.
>>zsm_Latn<< - People socialize in other ways - now, he says.
>>zsm_Latn<< Bar is no longer a community living room around where people visit him regularly ]
>>zsm_Latn<< As well as the church, he was worried that the money of the asset sales would not last as long as the leaders expected, -and sooner or later they would return again from the beginning ]
>>zsm_Latn<< The churches, he added, could have been replaced with apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not help keep the holy places left around him.
>>zsm_Latn<< ← Mayority of the person who will buy the condominium in these buildings is a white man, he said, - and for that reason will speed up the day in which these churches close simultaneously because it is unlikely that those who move to those condominium will be members of these churches--
>>zsm_Latn<< The two churches were built by the white congregation before Harlem became the blacks metropolitan city - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
>>zsm_Latn<< The original white Methodist council moved in the 1930s.
>>zsm_Latn<< The black congregation that had been worshipping in the surrounding area had taken over the building.
>>zsm_Latn<< St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation under the leadership of Pope John Howard, who led an retail merchant boycott on the road 125th, the main road to shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
>>zsm_Latn<< The fire in 1939 caused the building to be severely damaged, but when Ped Father Johnson's parishes planned to rebuild, they built tower bells.
>>zsm_Latn<< Priest David Johnson, Son of Priest Johnson and his successor at St. Martin proudly called the tower bell as ← London of the poor people's -
>>zsm_Latn<< An expert who played the tower bell in July gave it another title: \"A treasure of culture\" and - an unreplaced historical instrument -
>>zsm_Latn<< An expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University also noted that this was the first tower bell in the world played by the black musician Dionosio A. Lind who switched to ringing a larger tower bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
>>zsm_Latn<< What had happened at Santo Martin a few months ago was a complicated architectural story and contractor, some brought by lay church leaders, and others brought by Episcopal pride.
>>zsm_Latn<< Investry - the body of the office manager, formed from public leaders - wrote a letter to the occupation in July with the concern that the occupation would attempt to burden the expense of the occupancy ← on the part of the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the bank.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some parishes complain of a lack of transparency from the occupants.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hiu injured a 13-year-old teenager in lobster in California
>>zsm_Latn<< A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch lobsters in California in a lobster opening event, the charge of an officer.
>>zsm_Latn<< The attack occurred before 7 o'clock in the morning near the Beacon Beach in the Encidentity.
>>zsm_Latn<< Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had drowned with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy ask for help and then rowed in groups to help pull him out of the water.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a euphoria after catching lobsters, but then he-medy realized - that the boy was shouting, ‘I was bitten!
I'm bitten!'
>>zsm_Latn<< The entire skeleton is torn, - Hammel says that he realizes it when he has caught the child.
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘ There is a shark in the water! - Hammel adds.
>>zsm_Latn<< The boy was flown to Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was dealt with in critical conditions.
>>zsm_Latn<< The shark species responsible for the attack are unknown.
>>zsm_Latn<< Coast Safety Captain Larry Giles said in a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area a week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless shark species.
>>zsm_Latn<< Giles adds that the victim suffered severe injuries on the top of his body.
>>zsm_Latn<< The authorities closed the access to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinity for 48 hours for the interests of investigation and for security purposes.
>>zsm_Latn<< Giles realized that there are over 135 shark species in this region, but most of them are considered harmless.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sainsbury's plan broke the British beauty market
>>zsm_Latn<< Sainsbury took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with tossey-style kiosks managed by specialist assistants.
>>zsm_Latn<< As part of the substantial incentive to the British beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while the sale of fashion products and household equipment declines, the greater beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if it proves to be successful.
>>zsm_Latn<< Investments in beauty became hunt gears for supermarket parties to utilize once used shelves as places of TV stretching, microwaves, and household equipment.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sainsbury said that it would double the large bid of beauty up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie,Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
>>zsm_Latn<< The existing brand network currently begins with L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with their changing areas as found in stores such as Boots.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Supermarket also launched a series of makeups of its grains so that most of its products would be friendly to vegans - something that the young losers are increasingly interested in.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, the parfum retailer Fragrance Shop will test the concessions at two Sciencebury stores, the first opened in Croydon, London south of last week, while the second will be opened at Selly Oak, Birmingham, late this year.
>>zsm_Latn<< Online shopping and its switching purchase of daily food needs in small amounts in local grocery stores means that supermarkets should do something more to persuade people to visit.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Saisbury, has said that the noises will become more and more visible like the mall when the supermarket chain tries to fight back the forces like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and non-food services.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sainsbury has put Argos' stalls on hundreds of stores and has also introduced some Habitat's stalls since they bought the two franchises two years ago, which he says has supported the sale of daily food materials and made a more profitable acquisition.
>>zsm_Latn<< The previous supermarket attempts to renovate the beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended with failure.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sainsbury tested the joint effort with Boots in early 2000, but cooperation ended after there was a dispute on how to divide the profits from the chemical stores in the supermarket.
>>zsm_Latn<< A new strategy emerged after Saisbury sold 281 pharmaceutical store business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy franchise, worth £125 million, three years ago.
>>zsm_Latn<< It was mentioned that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding various luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
>>zsm_Latn<< Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury, said:‘We have changed the look and rainbow on the beauty kios-kios to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
>>zsm_Latn<< We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
>>zsm_Latn<< Our brand network was designed so that according to all the needs, the attractive environment and the convenient location indicated that we are currently the goal of enchanting that challenges the old way of shop-based--
>>zsm_Latn<< Peter Jones ‘geram' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a deal worth £11 million
>>zsm_Latn<< Dragons Den Star, Peter Jones went ‘with rage' after the TV host Holly Willoughby pulled away from a lifestyle business deal worth £11 million to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
>>zsm_Latn<< Willoughby had no time to manage their household equipment trademarks and accessory, Truly.
>>zsm_Latn<< This couple's business is comparable to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
>>zsm_Latn<< This Morning event host, aged 37, uses his Instagram account to announce that he is out.
>>zsm_Latn<< Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' star - Den, Petes Jones is angry by withdrawing at the last moments, from their profitable fun-style business - to focus on his larger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
>>zsm_Latn<< The source states that Jones was so -geram - when the gold girl of the TV admitted during a stressful meeting on Tuesday at her business royal headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to £1.5 million - meaning she no longer had enough time to devote herself to the trademarks of their household equipment and accessory, Truly.
>>zsm_Latn<< Their business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's wealth by £11 million.
>>zsm_Latn<< When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew leaving Britain towards one of his vacation homes,
>>zsm_Latn<< One source says: ØTruly so far is Holly's most important priority.
>>zsm_Latn<< It would have been his long-term future, which would have kept him for decades to come.
Her decision to step back made everyone involved very annoying.
>>zsm_Latn<< No one can believe what happened on Tuesday; it is near the time of the launch.
>>zsm_Latn<< There is a store full of goods in Marlow's main office ready for sale :
>>zsm_Latn<< Experts believe this Morning event carrier's departure, which is one of the most expensive British stars, can be detrimental to the company to millions of dollars due to a large investment in product form, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, as well as the potential delay of further launch.
>>zsm_Latn<< And this can mean the end of a long-term friendship.
>>zsm_Latn<< The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin are very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
>>zsm_Latn<< Willoughby established Truly along with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the chairman in March.
>>zsm_Latn<< The couple were on vacation together and Jones had 40 percent shares on Baldwin's TV production company.
>>zsm_Latn<< Willoughby would be the brand ambassador for M&S and would replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV host called I'm A Celebrity.
>>zsm_Latn<< A close narrative to Jones says last night - We're not going to comment on this business relationship--
>>zsm_Latn<< Speak seriously ‘and then we fall in love'
>>zsm_Latn<< She joked about the criticism she would get from the news media for making comments that some consider to be the \"non- presidential\" - and had been very positive towards North Korean leaders.
>>zsm_Latn<< Why did President Trump surrender so much?
Trump says with the voice of the joke - the news reader.
- I don't give up anything.
>>zsm_Latn<< She learns that Kim was interested in meeting twice after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for North Korea's denuclear.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the denuclear negotiations have ceased.
>>zsm_Latn<< More than three months after the meeting in June in Singapore, North Korea's highest diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at. The UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an appropriate -respons — from the United States to the early movement of North Korea's armscution.
>>zsm_Latn<< Instead, he notes, the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump sees more optimistic in his speech series.
- We're doing our best with North Korea, he says.
- If we fight North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship,
>>zsm_Latn<< He says that his success in repairing relationships with Kim has brought positive results - stopping rocket experiments, helping free hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
>>zsm_Latn<< And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relation to Kim.
- It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing there, - Trump said, while pointing towards the crowd right in front of him.
>>zsm_Latn<< Indonesia Tsunamis and Earthquakes Destroying a Island, Killing Hundreds of People
>>zsm_Latn<< As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-government organizations were told that they were not needed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population lost residence, there is no national disaster statement, as a prerequisite for bringing international help.
- In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they don't ask for international help, so this is a bit challenging, - the U.S.
>>zsm_Latn<< While Save The Children are organizing teams to leave to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff could work in the field.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sutopo's father, a spokesman for the national disaster prevention agency, said that Indonesian officials are reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies are allowed to contribute to assistance.
>>zsm_Latn<< Given the constant shock of the Indonesian earth, the country is still very unprepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
>>zsm_Latn<< While tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on the other coast line.
>>zsm_Latn<< There is no tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning of danger has already been declared, it is likely that it has contributed to the existence of life-threatening victims.
>>zsm_Latn<< At the best times, trips between many Indonesian islands are very challenging.
>>zsm_Latn<< Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
>>zsm_Latn<< A floating hospital that has been placed in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but will take at least three days to reach a new disaster location.
>>zsm_Latn<< President Joko Widodo has made the repair of broken Indonesian infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of highways and railroads.
>>zsm_Latn<< But lack of funds has interfered with Father Joko's reign while he faced a reelection next year.
>>zsm_Latn<< Joko also faced the pressure of the ongoing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the majority muslim had embraced a more conservative form of belief.
>>zsm_Latn<< Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people displaced from their homes when Muslim and Christian troops fought on the streets, using fields, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
>>zsm_Latn<< Witness: Liverpool player Daniel Sturgridge entered a balancing goal against Chelsea
>>zsm_Latn<< Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea on the Premier League with one score on a minute to 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sturridge receives bait from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside Chelsea's goal when his team is left 1-0.
>>zsm_Latn<< He puts the ball on his left side before kicking it towards a far pole.
>>zsm_Latn<< The ball rolls high above the goal when the ball rolls to the right corner over the net.
>>zsm_Latn<< The ball eventually falls past the Arrizabalaga Pepa that jumps and falls into the net.
- It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible, - the Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
- I saw Kante come and take one chance and don't think too much about it, and just do kicks--
>>zsm_Latn<< Chelsea leads with a score of 1-0 in the first mid after the original Bergianal player Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Blue attacker gives feedback to Matthew Kovacic on the game, before turning near the center line and running fast to the center of Liverpool.
>>zsm_Latn<< Kovacic quickly gives bait and runs in the middle line.
>>zsm_Latn<< He then did a perfect kick, leading Hazard towards the goal.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hazard managed to pass through the opponent's waist and kick the ball to the goal corner with a left leg kick, passing through the Liverpool Alisson Becker's kick.
>>zsm_Latn<< Liverpool fought Napolo in the round of the separating group of the Champion League at 3 p.m. Wednesday at Stadion San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
>>zsm_Latn<< Chelsea faced Videoton in the UEFA of the European League at 3 p.m. Thursday morning in London.
>>zsm_Latn<< Killed from Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
>>zsm_Latn<< The deaths of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have increased to 832 people, following a state disaster agency on Sunday morning.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many reportedly were trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed by a 7.5 magnitude Richter earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered a 20-foot high wave, said Sutopo Purwo, the agency's spokesman in a press conference.
>>zsm_Latn<< Palu, a town of over 380,000 people, was filled with rubble of buildings that collapsed.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for alleged murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
>>zsm_Latn<< The investigation of murder has been done after the body of a woman found at Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
>>zsm_Latn<< 44-year-old women were found at Grayson Mews, John's road, at 7.55 a.m. with some stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was held for alleged murder.
>>zsm_Latn<< Police have asked people around who see or hear something to come face-to-face.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: \"The investigation is still at an early stage but I ask everyone who is around John's road at Birkenhead who sees or hears something suspicious to contact us.
>>zsm_Latn<< I also congratulated everyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have recorded something on a dasher camera to contact us because they might have important information for our investigation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
>>zsm_Latn<< This afternoon, friends who felt confident that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
>>zsm_Latn<< The investigation is still taking place as the police have said, they are in the process of informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
>>zsm_Latn<< A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews had just returned to his apartment, but was told by the police that nobody was allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man can't say anything when he knows what's going on.
>>zsm_Latn<< Citizens are currently being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed back in.
>>zsm_Latn<< A police officer is heard to be telling someone that all areas are now being imposed as the scene of the incident.
>>zsm_Latn<< A woman appears at a location in a state of crying.

>>zsm_Latn<< Cromwell Parliament count became the last memory that was exposed to scans ‘history rewriting'
>>zsm_Latn<< His expulsion would be poetic justice for the destruction of the ala-Taliban against many British cultural artifacts and religious practices carried out by the fanatical Puritan followers.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the Cromwell society described Mr. Crick's advice as a ‘stupidish' and - attempting to re-write the history'
>>zsm_Latn<< John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell's Society, said: -this cannot be avoided in the current debate about the destruction of statues, that the figure Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster's palace would be targeted.
>>zsm_Latn<< British civil war Iconoklasm was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
>>zsm_Latn<< Perhaps the wrong Cromwell descendants would have been sacrificed for Thomas' ancestral actions in the previous century.
>>zsm_Latn<< The remarkable representation of Cromwell from Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure still believed many people are still worth celebrating.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mr. Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: -Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more by the late 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against outside pressure, in his case of course the kingdom.
>>zsm_Latn<< Is it a fully accurate representation, still a subject of ongoing historical debate.
>>zsm_Latn<< The definite is that the conflict in the mid- 17th century has shaped the next nation's development, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that represents one side of that difference.
>>zsm_Latn<< His success as the Shepherd is also worthy of being celebrated and remembered ]
>>zsm_Latn<< Murderers Persecuted Chinese Farmers to Death
>>zsm_Latn<< A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
>>zsm_Latn<< Man, identified only by the name of his gentuan - was found to die with a severed artery, covered with blood near a pork cage in the market of the province of Liupansgui province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reporting on Sunday.
>>zsm_Latn<< A pig raiser prepares to inject a vaccine to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
>>zsm_Latn<< He is reported to have gone with his cousin from the neighboring territory of the province of Yunnan on Thursday to sell 15 pigs tails in the market.
>>zsm_Latn<< The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the nearby pork cage door open.
>>zsm_Latn<< He says that in a pig's cage there is a large pig with blood in his mouth.
>>zsm_Latn<< Forensic research confirmed that the male pig with a weight of 550 pounds had abused the nurse until he died, based on the report.
>>zsm_Latn<< ← My cousin's body is bleeding and destroyed, - the word of the cousin known to mara -Wu - as cited by Guiyang Evening News.
>>zsm_Latn<< Security camera recordings show Yuan entering the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
>>zsm_Latn<< His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man was neither Yuan's or his cousin.
>>zsm_Latn<< A market manager told Evening News that the pig was already locked up to prevent not attacking others, while the police gathered evidence at the scene of the incident.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Yuan family and market authorities were reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
>>zsm_Latn<< Despite the rare, cases of pig attack against humans have also occurred before.
>>zsm_Latn<< In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusett resulted in the man being seriously injured.
>>zsm_Latn<< 10 years earlier, a pig weighed 650 pounds narrowing a Welsh farmer to his tractor until the wife feared and drove out the animal.

>>zsm_Latn<< The remains of Rosa's storm brought heavy rain widespread to the southwest of the United States.
>>zsm_Latn<< Like estimates, the Rosa storms weaken as they move over colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
>>zsm_Latn<< After all, Rosa would cause flooding throughout the northern and southwest regions of Mexico the United States a few days to come.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rosa has winds at 85 mph, Hurricane Category 1, starting at 5 a.m. The Sunday time of the East Territory, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rosa is likely to move north on Sunday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Meanwhile, Palung began to form above the Pacific Ocean and moved east, toward the U.S. Western Coast when Rosa approached the California Barja peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push tropical humidity northward to southwest U.S.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rosa will bring rain up to 10 inches in part of Mexico on Monday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Then, the tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching trough will create widespread rainfall in the Southwest for several days to come.
>>zsm_Latn<< Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain would cause a dangerous swarm of bands, a flow of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
>>zsm_Latn<< Low tropical humidity would cause rainfall levels to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour at some point, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
>>zsm_Latn<< As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain is estimated to fall in some parts of the Southwest, especially in most Arizona.
>>zsm_Latn<< The floods are likely to occur with conditions that worsen rapidly due to the widespread tropical rain properties.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is hardly advisable to explore the desert by walking due to tropical rain threats.
>>zsm_Latn<< Heavy rain can lead to torrents into violent rivers and storms will carry local and dusty winds.
>>zsm_Latn<< The approaching trough will cause local heavy rain to parts of the coast of South California.
>>zsm_Latn<< Total rainfall that exceeds half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to become slippery.
>>zsm_Latn<< This would be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some scattered tropical rain would begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before the rain became more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Heavy rain would extend to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
>>zsm_Latn<< In October there will be some great temperature changes throughout the U.S. as the Arctic becomes cooler, but the tropical areas remain warm enough.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes in short distance.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are exact examples of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central U.S. region on Sunday.
>>zsm_Latn<< There was a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
>>zsm_Latn<< During the next few days, the remaining summer warmth will form and re-spread.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most of the central and eastern U.S. regions are expected to start warm in October with the speed of spreading as much as 80s from the South Plain to the Northeast parts.
>>zsm_Latn<< New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
>>zsm_Latn<< Our long-term climate forecast shows high chances for temperatures above average for the eastern U.S. to early mid October.
Over 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
>>zsm_Latn<< Over 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by potential Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of committing the alleged sexual violence in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the meantime, political settlement continued, with the presence of publishers who hosted regular events to announce the unexpected events in the last minute of Friday: A deal designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flyake for the FBI to conduct an investigation for one week on the charge.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent certain if Kavanaugh was washing her body in a drunken state and tried to remove her clothes at the High School party.
>>zsm_Latn<< Kavanaugh, in his fictitious testimony, says that he was 100 percent sure it wasn't happening.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, have watched it.
>>zsm_Latn<< The company calculates the average viewers in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
>>zsm_Latn<< Calculations for other networks that broadcast this are not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
>>zsm_Latn<< And Nielsen usually had difficulties in counting the number of people who witnessed it in the office.

>>zsm_Latn<< Facebook, Google and other technology companies have already employed characters from universities for AI research several years ago.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lee says that immigration policy changes can also help the U.S. to support efforts around AI.
>>zsm_Latn<< -I think green cards can be offered automatically for a PHD degree holder in the AI field, - he says.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Chinese State Council issued the Next Generation Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funds for people in academic institutions just like the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic tasks is lower in China, says Lee.

- All the effort we put forth in November is in jeopardy.
>>zsm_Latn<< Five weeks before the implementation of the most important selection in our lives.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is one of the big, big -- I didn't really run that is why I fought in all places for an extraordinary candidate, » he said.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump goes on, \"You see a group of radical Democrats that is very-frighted, you can see it happening today.
>>zsm_Latn<< And they decided to regain power in any way, you saw evil, their abominations.
>>zsm_Latn<< They don't care who they hurt, who they have to bind in order to gain power and control, that is what they want, that is, power and control, we will not give them.
>>zsm_Latn<< Democrats, he said, are on the mission to α destination and block )
- And you saw it for the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats - evil and vile and impregnable -
>>zsm_Latn<< He refers to the Senate of Dianne Feinstein who served on the Senate's Committee of Justice by calling upon his name, which was warmly welcomed from his listeners.
- Remember the answer?
>>zsm_Latn<< Do you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
>>zsm_Latn<< No, uh no, I wait for it - it's a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen--
The Labor Party is no longer a public service place.
>>zsm_Latn<< Now be an inhibiter to whoever exposes his mind
>>zsm_Latn<< When the Momentum activist at the local party I gave a vote to denounce myself, it was not surprising.
>>zsm_Latn<< Also, I was in the final order of the Parliament Members, who were told that our presence was not expected - all of it because we were expressing opinions.
>>zsm_Latn<< My college in parliament, Joan Ryan got similar treatment because he defended antisemitism firmly.
>>zsm_Latn<< In my case, the cold movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
>>zsm_Latn<< Regarding the importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, in Europe, an issue that is ironically equal to that which Jeremy Corbyn opposed to the previous leader.
>>zsm_Latn<< The notice for the meeting of the eastern Nottingham workers on Friday stated that - we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive ]
>>zsm_Latn<< For nearly eight years I became a member of the local Labor Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on Friday Night was exactly that way.
>>zsm_Latn<< Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises of better politics, are more friendly - rather than long forgotten, if, indeed it has ever begun.
>>zsm_Latn<< The difference in opinion in the labor party is becoming more and more clearly out oflerant and each opinion is assessed its eligibility by party authority.
>>zsm_Latn<< It started immediately after Jeremy became a leader, as a colleague I thought would be able to share the same political views, starting to expect me to turn around and accept the position I would never want to accept - both in national security and the single market of the European Union.
>>zsm_Latn<< Whenever I speak openly - and no matter what I say - then there will be followed a scandal in social media that asks for a revocation of the show, injuring central politics, telling me I shouldn't have served in the Labor party.
And it wasn't just me who had it.
>>zsm_Latn<< Of course, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
>>zsm_Latn<< I admire the professionalism and limitations of my associates who face sexual abuse or racism every day but never avoid.
>>zsm_Latn<< One of the most frustrating aspects in today's political era is how level of abuse has been considered reasonable.
>>zsm_Latn<< Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labor party should help develop a culture of tolerance.
>>zsm_Latn<< The reality is that we are no longer on a wider church and with any motion - not self-trusting - or changing party rule selection to be more limited.
>>zsm_Latn<< I got a lot of advice over the past two years that encouraged me to keep the head down, not too vocally voiced opinions, and then I would say--well--
But I fell into politics not to do that.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago when still a school student, promoted by the neglect of the government of Thatcher which resulted in my comprehensive school class literally collapsed, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who desperately need it - both as local counselor and minister in government.
>>zsm_Latn<< I have never hidden my political actions, including the last election.
>>zsm_Latn<< No one in East Nottingham would question my policy position and things that I do not agree with in current leadership.
>>zsm_Latn<< For those who encourage the motion on Friday, what I can say is when the state moves quickly towards the division of sovereignty (Brexit), it will endanger our state business and public services, I don't want to waste time and energy for loyalty to the Labor party leader.
But really, my one message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituency, either as a member of the Labor party or not.

>>zsm_Latn<< Now they are in the top order, the only unconquered party of ten.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the end, their superior defense, and the ability to achieve the best opportunity, which makes Peter Murchie's host team and coach get the right to feel happy.
- So far we've been testing our game, and we're still inconspicuous so we're happy, she says.
>>zsm_Latn<< Robyn Christie of Melrose said: \"The award for Ayr, they are better at taking the opportunity compared to what we do--
>>zsm_Latn<< Grant Anderson's experiment in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr in front, yet a yellow card for the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given on that game by Warriors, gave Melrose an opportunity to print numbers and Jason Baggot rips an unconverted experiment.
>>zsm_Latn<< Climo disarms Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, he scored a goal then doing a single experiment to make Ayr score 17-5 at rest.
>>zsm_Latn<< But Melrose started the second middle well and Patrick Anderson's experiment changed by Baggot, reducing the chances to five points.
>>zsm_Latn<< Then there was a long pause because Ruaridh Knott had a serious wound, was pushed out, and since the beginning of the game, Ayr drove faster beyond the efforts of Stafford McDowall's experiment, changed by Climo.
>>zsm_Latn<< Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then exposed to a yellow card and again, Melrose made a spare player pay with an unchanged Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of hard pressure.
>>zsm_Latn<< The host has returned to play, will but, by the time Struan Hutchinson gets a yellow card because it supports Climo without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrives behind the advanced wounded Ayr.
>>zsm_Latn<< Climo was replaced, as it was again, almost since the beginning of the game, after Kyle Rowe did goal kicks and frustrated the fifth effort of Gregor Henry's deputy.

>>zsm_Latn<< The hope was likely to reach its peak in decades, as Bolivia waited for a court order on the 1st of October after a five-year contest.
- Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and a sure hope for the outcome, says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ trial on a wide screen throughout the country, hoping that the court in Den Haag will support Bolivia's demands that -after a few decades of tense negotiations it -Cile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia's sovereignty guarantee over the ocean.
>>zsm_Latn<< Evo Morales, Bolivian indigenous President who faced controversial warfare for the election of the next birthday - also had much support at the Monday trial.
- We're very close to the return of the Pacific Ocean, he's sworn by the end of August.
>>zsm_Latn<< But some analysts are convinced that the court is unlikely to decide Bolivia's wishes- and that it will only change slightly if it allows.
>>zsm_Latn<< Dutch-based the UN body has no power to surrender Chile's territory, and it has already established that it will not decide the outcome of the possibility of negotiations.
>>zsm_Latn<< That the ICJ decree came only six months after the final argument had already been heard, which indicated the case - uncomplicated, - said Paz Zárate, an international lawyer of Chile.
>>zsm_Latn<< And still away from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years it may have been a setback.
- The access to the sea has been tracked by the Bolivian government now, say.
>>zsm_Latn<< The aggressive rhetoric of Morales has already weakened a good ectikad of the remaining Chileans, he says.
>>zsm_Latn<< Bolivia and Chile at a certain point will remain reasonable, yet it will be very difficult to keep discussions after this.
>>zsm_Latn<< Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
>>zsm_Latn<< Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, deputy Bolivian government in Den Haag rejected the idea of decision making quickly.
>>zsm_Latn<< Monday would give Bolivia a remarkable opportunity to open an era of relationship with Chile . and an opportunity to . . . ending 139 years of dispute with mutual advantage, she said.

>>zsm_Latn<< North Korea Minister Ri Yong Ho said first his country would never disarm nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ri made a statement on Saturday at the time of the UN General Congregation.

>>zsm_Latn<< John Edward: Language expertise is crucial to global citizens
>>zsm_Latn<< Scotland's private school keeps track of academic superiority, and this is continued in 2018 with remarkable test results, which are increasingly reinforced by each student and collective success in sports, art, music as well as hard effort.
>>zsm_Latn<< With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Board (SCIS) trying hard to provide the best services for students and parents.
>>zsm_Latn<< Schools aim to prepare their students for advanced and higher education, their career of choice, and their role as citizens of the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< As the educational sector that can design and implement the school curriculum according to expectations, we see modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice subjects in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: - If you talk to someone in the language he understands, your words will come into his head.
>>zsm_Latn<< If you talk to him in his language then your speech will come into his heart -
>>zsm_Latn<< This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if it wants to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< From the latest test results this year, we can see that the language is the top position of the league table with the highest graduation value in the self-school.
>>zsm_Latn<< Total 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language get A Plus value.
>>zsm_Latn<< The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools showing that 72 percent of students get A Plus grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent who learn Spanish also get an A value.
>>zsm_Latn<< This suggests that schools of self-sufficiency in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that will certainly be required by children and adolescents in the future.
>>zsm_Latn<< Today languages, as subjects options, are held in the same standard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in modern school curriculums and elsewhere.
>>zsm_Latn<< A survey conducted by the British Labor and Skill Service in 2014 found that of some reasons why employers should continue to struggle to fill the rungans, 17 percent why is a lack of speaking skills.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their career in the future.
>>zsm_Latn<< With more work opportunities requiring speaking ability, this skill is important in the global world.
>>zsm_Latn<< Whatever one's career choices, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will experience real benefits because of having this kind of lifelong skill.
>>zsm_Latn<< Being able to communicate directly with residents of foreign countries will automatically make a superior multilingual in competition.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to YouGov's poll of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak foreign language well enough to conduct conversations and French into the only language spoken in two percentage digits, which is 15 percent.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is why investing in language teaching for children today is important for the present.
>>zsm_Latn<< Having multilingual abilities, especially countries' languages with developing economies, will multiply children with better opportunities to find meaningful work.
>>zsm_Latn<< In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some schools will focus on a more classic modern language, while others will teach a language considered most important in England for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
>>zsm_Latn<< Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages that can be selected in private school, with teachers who are experts in this field.
>>zsm_Latn<< Scottish private schools are intended to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and multiply them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
>>zsm_Latn<< It cannot be denied that at present, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
>>zsm_Latn<< In fact, modern languages should really be considered to be the international communication skills »
>>zsm_Latn<< Self-schools will continue to offer these choices, diversity, and excellence for Scottish teenagers.

>>zsm_Latn<< But the main purpose of this common common common meeting agenda is to help the Republican party to get some momentum in the face of the November general election.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, in President Trump's campaign it is mentioned that five general meetings this next week are aimed at -ening the volunteers and supporters because the Republican party is trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House, » according to Reuters.
>>zsm_Latn<< - congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will be as likely to travel to the states as long as we are facing a busy campaign season, - Trump campaign spokesman who refuses to mention his name delivered to Reuters.
>>zsm_Latn<< Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's public meeting is expected to present supporters from ‘Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as attracting coverage from Pittsburgh's media, - according to West Virginia Metro News.
>>zsm_Latn<< Saturday would be the second Trump visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, the Western Virginia Senate candidate from the Republican Party left in the poll.
>>zsm_Latn<< —Not a good sign for Morrisey so that the president should come as an attempt to increase his profits in the polls, - said Simon Haeder, a political expert at Western Virginia University, according to Reuters.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ryder Cup 2018: The United States team's show of courage maintains its hope in facing a single Sunday game
>>zsm_Latn<< After three once-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome sessions are what may be necessary in this Ryder Cup.
>>zsm_Latn<< The momentum bandul swing is a concept of exercise which is a result that players fully trust, and no one exceeds in this kind of competition.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to them where is the current momentum?
- Previously, they had surpassed six points and now four, so I guess we thought it was a little moment, - after Jordan Spieth that day.
>>zsm_Latn<< Surely Europe has the advantage of superior four points with twelve more games.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the American Team, as Spieth says, felt they had a little momentum and they had many things that could be spirit, no exception to the formation of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasted three of the four points.
>>zsm_Latn<< Spieth has played deadlyly from the area of the tee to the green area and leads in order.
>>zsm_Latn<< The cheering of the separatism that said it was getting harder as the turn arrived, doing an important putting punch to make a series match when he and Thomas lost two opponents.
>>zsm_Latn<< Theputing shot from him who won them at a 15 respondable number with similar shouts, the screams that tell you that he is sure America won't lose.
>>zsm_Latn<< You really should try harder and worry about your own game, - the word Spieth.
>>zsm_Latn<< All of these players have gone now.
>>zsm_Latn<< 18 holes need to be marked.
>>zsm_Latn<< The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday was Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed story of Ryder Cup.
>>zsm_Latn<< The unique but attractive pair from Europe is four for four and can do without mistakes.
>>zsm_Latn<< Moliwood - is the only couple who did not do a bogey punch on Saturday afternoon, but they were also spared from bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Run, and how their energy seemed to flow both to and from this excited crowd which assured that they were players who had to be defeated on Sunday, and no more famous player than Fleetwood nor Molinari would lock the potential of European victory at the time of sunset over Le Golf National.
>>zsm_Latn<< It would be better if at the same time both were placed in different holes.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, it remains too early to talk about European victory.
>>zsm_Latn<< Bubb Watson and Webb Simpson shortened the work of Sergio Garcia, a fourball hero in the morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
>>zsm_Latn<< One bogey and two double on the nine front such as digging holes that would never be able to be scanned by these Spanish and Swedish golfers.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although, on Sunday no one can help you get out of the hole.
>>zsm_Latn<< Fourball and foursome are a good show to be seen closer because of the interaction among couples, the suggestions they offer, the suggestions they don't give and how strategies can change at once.
>>zsm_Latn<< So far, Europe played better as a team and led quite a long way towards the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the U.S. team had a nuance to fight even though some of the parties were skeptical, especially in the United States.
>>zsm_Latn<< Europe advanced 10-6 on the last day Ryder Cup
>>zsm_Latn<< Europe would take advantage of the final day Ryder Cup after the rise of the fourball game and the foursome Saturdays by leading 10-6 over the United States.
>>zsm_Latn<< The inspired Duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over Tiger Woods who had to fight to record their points so far at Le Golf National with four points.
>>zsm_Latn<< The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to maintain the least available trophies at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the target American team in the fourball morning, making the results of this series 3-1.
>>zsm_Latn<< The United States gives more resistance in the foursome, winning two games, but they cannot reduce deficits.
>>zsm_Latn<< Jim Furyk's team requires eight points from 12 single-day games Sunday to maintain trophies.
>>zsm_Latn<< Fleetwood was the first European debugger to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who were dubbed -Molliwood - after the end of the censusal week, were only the second pair who won four points from the opening of their four games in Ryder Cup history.
>>zsm_Latn<< After defeating the Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they became very solid to defeat the Woods whichlempet and American portraits Bryson Dechambeau with more firm 5&4.
>>zsm_Latn<< Woods, who forced himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally performed brilliant but he had already lost 19 of the 29 games in the fourball and the foursome as well as the consecutive ovens.
>>zsm_Latn<< Justin Rose, resting on the fourball morning, then returned to pair with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three worlds.
>>zsm_Latn<< Europe did not achieve it itself despite the day being fun and winding in southwest Paris.
>>zsm_Latn<< The major winners of three times Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a gauge for America with two points on Saturday.
>>zsm_Latn<< They got a 2&1 victory that attracted Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in the fourball then returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
>>zsm_Latn<< It only happens twice in Ryder Cup history where a team returns from the deficit four points into a single game, though as the Furyk team's survival champion only needs a series point to maintain the trofi.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, after being the second best for two days, the return attack on Sunday appears to be as if it would go beyond them.
>>zsm_Latn<< North Korea says 'not possible' will disarm side by side without trust
>>zsm_Latn<< On Saturday, North Korea's foreign Minister delivered to the UN regarding the sanctions that constantly deepened their distrust of the United States and it was unlikely that the country stripped off its nuclear weapons separately in such a situation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ri Yong Ho delivered to the world's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken - significant measures that showed good intentions - in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, disseminating nuclear testing locations, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons as well as nuclear technology.
- Anyway, we don't see any appropriate responses from the United States, she says.
>>zsm_Latn<< ← If trust in the United States would have no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we could not have disarmed our own weapons first on the part of the first -
>>zsm_Latn<< While Ri repeats the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance on the α- gradually-to denuclear approach where North Korea will be punished for taking a gradual step, significant statements are delivered to it that they do not fully resist as Pyongyang did in the past.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a peak meeting between the president's office of the United States and the newly held North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, at the time Kim promised to seek out the -denucilillation of the Korean peninsula - while Trump promised North Korea's security guarantees.
>>zsm_Latn<< North Korea had wanted an official end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pyongyang had to stop his nuclear weapons first.
>>zsm_Latn<< Washington also refused a call to loosen international heavy sanctions on North Korea.
>>zsm_Latn<< The United States insists on -deciliarization first - and increases the pressure by granting seminal sanctions to their purpose strictly, and even rejects the -composing of the end of the war, - after Ri.
>>zsm_Latn<< The perception that the sanctions could make us bend down is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
>>zsm_Latn<< But, the problem is that such constant sanctions will deepen our distrust -
>>zsm_Latn<< Ri does not mention plans for a second peak meeting between Kim and Trump highlighted the leader of the United States in the United Nations early this week.
>>zsm_Latn<< The minister instead highlights three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and adds: \"If the problematic side in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, Korea's peninsula denuclear will not be until it meets this kind of end-path-
>>zsm_Latn<< Ri's tone of speech, however, was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke to the United Nations General Congregation that targeting North Korea rockets on the land of the United States was an inevitable matter after the - Mr. President of the Devil - Trump called Kim — the rocket man on a suicide mission.
>>zsm_Latn<< This year at a UN meeting, Trump who last year threatened to . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
>>zsm_Latn<< On Wednesday, Trump says that he has no time limit for this, - If this takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter - he says.
>>zsm_Latn<< China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the step taken.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, delivered to the UN Security Council on Thursday that: - Maintaining the sanctions of the Security Council should be ongoing and should not fail until we find out that full decilirization, final and verifiable -
>>zsm_Latn<< Security Councils unanimously increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to stop funding of the Pyongyang nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
>>zsm_Latn<< Pompeo meets Ri in the United Nations General Assembly cells and says afterwards that he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second peak meeting.
>>zsm_Latn<< Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip is not well.
>>zsm_Latn<< He left Pyongyang in July while saying that there has actually been progress, only North Korea in the count of hours of dusty that he made - a rule like a gangster-
>>zsm_Latn<< North Korea promises in a meeting with Moon this month to unpack the location of the missiles as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes - an appropriate move--
>>zsm_Latn<< She states that Kim's telling her to do -the move that fits her desire is the security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and moves towards normalization of relations with Washington.
>>zsm_Latn<< Harvard students take a course on adequate rest
>>zsm_Latn<< A new course at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students there sleep more, in an effort against macho culture in learning that is developing through the 'man of owl' powered caffeine.
>>zsm_Latn<< An academic found that students at the university number one world often don't know anything if they discuss very fundamental things about how to protect themselves.
>>zsm_Latn<< Charles Czeisler, professor of specialized sleep problems at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course, which he believed was the first of his type in the U.S.
>>zsm_Latn<< He was inspired to start a course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
>>zsm_Latn<< 'In the end a girl came to me and said: 'Why was I just told now, in my last year?'
>>zsm_Latn<< The girl said no one ever told about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' she said to The Telegraph.
>>zsm_Latn<< The course launched first this year, explaining to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improving their general well-being.
>>zsm_Latn<< Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the director of university health care, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding a student who was very lacking in sleep all week.
>>zsm_Latn<< This one hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
>>zsm_Latn<< In one session there is a picture of a boarding room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of the influence of caffeine and lights, as well as how athletic results are affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep time routines.
>>zsm_Latn<< In other parts, participants get an explanation of how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
>>zsm_Latn<< A campus map, with an interactive icon, then encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
>>zsm_Latn<< 'We know this will not change students' behavior instantly.
>>zsm_Latn<< But we are convinced that they have the right to know - as is that you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health,' healing Prof Czeisler.
>>zsm_Latn<< Culture is proud of 'fields' still exist, its advocate, plus that modern technology and constant pressure increase in students meaning sleep deprivation is a continuing problem.
>>zsm_Latn<< Make sure you sleep enough, with good quality, should be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, its neck - even to avoid added weight, because lack of sleep makes the brain activate hunger mode, causing a sense of continuing hunger.
>>zsm_Latn<< Raymond So, a 19-year-old California resident who studied chemistry and physical biology that helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
>>zsm_Latn<< She says that this course has opened her eyes and inspired her to organize courses for the entire campus.
>>zsm_Latn<< The next step, he hopes that the entire graduate student is instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
>>zsm_Latn<< Prof Czeisler recommends that students should consider setting up sleep time alarms, also awake alarms, and be aware of the effects of ‘ blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can shift the rhythm of your circulation out of its program path thus causing sleep problems.
>>zsm_Latn<< Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Lowering Gerrard's mental forces
>>zsm_Latn<< Again, Rangers felt the grief of the yesterday's day at Dolly Mena's attack delivering the lost Steven Gerrard team on the 1-0 defeat in Livingstone.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Ibrax team attempted to record their first victory on their trip, since 4-1 victory in February in St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team had just given a second defeat to Gerrard in 18 games as manager, causing his team to be left eight points from the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts class.
>>zsm_Latn<< Attacking seven minutes before the first round is completed and the Rangers who are out of reason don't seem to balance.
>>zsm_Latn<< While Rangers are now down to the sixth position, Livingstone rises to the third position, leaving only a goal deviation from Hibernian.
>>zsm_Latn<< And there may be further problems in the Rangers hut after the Culum Spence line guard has to be treated because of a wound in the head after an object is thrown away from the distance.
>>zsm_Latn<< Gerrard made eight changes to the team that smuggled Ayr to the Bethfred Cup semifinal.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, Holt goes with the same Livi 11 who took one point from Hearts last week and he would be pleased with the costumes that fascinated their opponents at every opportunity.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rangers may dominate ball ownership, but Livingstone utilizes the balls they have better.
>>zsm_Latn<< They should have recorded the score in just two minutes when the first short bait Mena was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but that guard drew that big opportunity too wide.
>>zsm_Latn<< Jacobs' deep free kicks met the captain Craig Halkett but his defender Alan Lithgow could only penetrate wide in the back position.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rangers take control but there seems to be more hope than belief about their game in the third final.
>>zsm_Latn<< Alfredo Morelos must have felt that he was supposed to get a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided on a quarter hour mark but Steven Thomson's referee refused to appeal to this Colombian citizen.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rangers were only able to do two throws in the first round but the previous Hebox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was almost never troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's head conspiracy and an easy-to-ended Ejaria Ovie attack.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be contrary to the course of the match, no one can deny that they deserve it due to their own hard work.
>>zsm_Latn<< Again Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep dead ball tactics.
>>zsm_Latn<< Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm choosing Menga for a simple end.
>>zsm_Latn<< Gerrard acted during a break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the turn almost exerted a direct influence as that wing player put the ball on Morelos but Kelly who played impressive quickly out of the line to block.
>>zsm_Latn<< But Livingstone continued to force the sign team to play the exact game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweep all the long balls.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Holt team was supposed to extend their superiority at the final stage but McGregor stood well to drive Jacobs away before Lithgow had pushed wide from the corner.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rangers' replacement player, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty as he separated with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face.
>>zsm_Latn<< Almanac: Founder Geiger Breaker
>>zsm_Latn<< And now from the Almanac -Sunay Morning - our page: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and MATIONS OF THE BREAKING...day of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm -Hans - Geiger was born in Germany.
>>zsm_Latn<< Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, it was an invention that eventually made the device referred to as the Geiger Breaker.
>>zsm_Latn<< Being a science-based tool since then, Geiger's founder also became a pop culturealist, as in the 1950's film -Bells of Coronado, - stared at the seemingly less convincing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What is that thing?
>>zsm_Latn<< Rogers: - This is Geiger Breaker, used to find a location of radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
>>zsm_Latn<< When wearing these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atom released by radioactivity in the mineral--
Evans: - Tell me, it's coming up now!
>>zsm_Latn<< -Hans - Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his63th birthday.
But it was an invention that preserved his name and preserved him alive.

>>zsm_Latn<< New cancer vaccines teach immune systems to 'know' bad cells and kill them
>>zsm_Latn<< The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of the treatment
>>zsm_Latn<< The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the laboratory
>>zsm_Latn<< They can then 'know' the protein common in many cancers and then injected again
>>zsm_Latn<< An experiment vaccine shows promising results in patients with a wide range of cancers.
>>zsm_Latn<< A woman treated with the vaccine, which is that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, her ovary cancer is lost for more than 18 months.
>>zsm_Latn<< This method involves the patient's immune cell extraction process, transforming it in the laboratory so that they are able to - identify - a protein that is generally found in many cancers called HER2, and then reinjecting the cell.
>>zsm_Latn<< Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Society at Bethesda, Maryland, said: \"The result is that we have a very promising vaccine--
>>zsm_Latn<< HER2–pressing growth of several types of cancers, - including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colorectals, Prof Berzofsky explains.
>>zsm_Latn<< The same approach as the taking of a patient's immune cell and - instructing - to them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.

>>zsm_Latn<< The representatives of Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of her staff members had sent personal information to three U.S. Republican senators to the Wikipedia page of members of parliament.

>>zsm_Latn<< Johnny English Strikes Against - less good Rowan Atkinson spy parody
>>zsm_Latn<< Currently looking for Brexit's significance in each new film with a view of British bias has already become a tradition and it seems to apply to the emergence of the parody fratern-commedi Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
>>zsm_Latn<< Will synchronous sarkasme about how obviously we are a new export opportunity for this country?
>>zsm_Latn<< In any case, Johnny English, whose eyes are melotat, rubber face, and incompetence has renewed his license to mess up all things for the second time - his name gives more insight than anything that he is a broad comic creation designed for a region of language cinema other than England.
>>zsm_Latn<< Certainly he was a crazy secret agent who, regardless of his strange suspicion, had little Cloteau character, a short character of Mr. Bean and a traveller's pocket that contributed little note to the Chariots of Fire's theme at London's 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
>>zsm_Latn<< Indeed, he is indeed based on the traveller and the international mystery man that Atkinson has ever played in the now forgotten Barclay TV advertisement, leaving chaos behind him.
>>zsm_Latn<< There is one or two sweet moments on this latest JE trip.
>>zsm_Latn<< I like it when Johnny English approached the helicopter by wearing mid-centuryzims and the rotor propellers quickly stuck in his helmet.
>>zsm_Latn<< Atkinson presents for physical comedies are displayed, but the humor feels less powerful and too strange, especially when film brand -serius - such as 007 and Mission Impossible has been confident of inserting comedy as a material.
>>zsm_Latn<< The rumor felt as though intended for children rather than adults, and for me a variety of odd English Johnny's oddly unsensive and a focused joke of Atkinson's films in Bean's personality.
>>zsm_Latn<< The premises that are being warm these years are that England is in serious trouble.
>>zsm_Latn<< A cyber hacker has entered a super secret British spy web network, uncovering the identity of all British agents in the field, to frustrate the agent in charge - unfortunately just a small role for Kevin Eldon.
>>zsm_Latn<< This was the last opportunity for the arrogant and hostile prime minister, who had already completely destroyed his political popularity: Emma Thompson played an excellent role in the character of the quasi-Teresa-May but not much could be done from his script.
>>zsm_Latn<< His intelligent adviser gives the information that because any active spy has been weakened, he must bring a person out of retirement.
>>zsm_Latn<< And that means Johnny's own elbow, now employed as headmaster in some fancy buildings, but it provides a secret lesson on how to perform a covert operation: there are some good jokes here, when English offers a spy academy like the School of Rock.
>>zsm_Latn<< English was returned to Whitehall for emergency guidance and was reunited with an old friend who had been suffering for a long time — Bough, hit by Ben Miller again.
>>zsm_Latn<< Bough is now married, enslaving a submarine commander, the awkward role of top-class women where Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat eliminated.
>>zsm_Latn<< So Batman and Robin made the mistake on the Secret Agent Your Majesty was re-acting, meeting the beautiful woman of the mystery Ophelia Bulletin that Olga Kurylenko played.
>>zsm_Latn<< Meanwhile, the prime minister worriedly falls under the influence of charismatic technology militants who claim to be able to solve the problems of British computers: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
>>zsm_Latn<< English and Bough started their silly adventure: disguised as servants, they burned up French fast-serving restaurants; they made chaos by plunging themselves over Volta's luxury ship; and English triggered anarchy when he tried to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with Volta's interior.
>>zsm_Latn<< All stops are certainly drawn for the last sequence, but with such hospitality and harassment, there is little children's TV channel that contains about everything.
>>zsm_Latn<< It's quite moderate.
>>zsm_Latn<< And as with other English film Johnny, I can't think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a truly appropriate role for his talent?
>>zsm_Latn<< Labor was planning for British citizens in order to work four days a week but paid five days
>>zsm_Latn<< Jeremy Corbyn of the Labor States considered radical plans that wanted British citizens to work four days a week - but paid five days.
>>zsm_Latn<< The United States reportedly wanted the owners of the company to continue the results of saving through an artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for the workers by giving them additional holidays.
>>zsm_Latn<< He will let employees enjoy the weekend three days - but still get the same pay.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some sources say that the idea will 'pas' with party economic agendas and plans encourage the country to support workers.
>>zsm_Latn<< The four days of the week had been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
>>zsm_Latn<< A source, which is the senior of the Labor Union told The Sunday Times: 'Review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
>>zsm_Latn<< 'This will not happen overnight, but the four working days of the week are an aspiration that corresponds to the party's approach in order to rebalance the economy that supports the workers as well as the overall party industry strategy.'
>>zsm_Latn<< The Labor Party was not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party had promised four working days a week on the 2017 election campaign.
>>zsm_Latn<< The aspirations are not currently supported by the entire Labor Party, however.
>>zsm_Latn<< Labor Party spokesman said: 'Empa day work in a week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
>>zsm_Latn<< Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labor conference last week to perfect his vision for the socialist revolution in the field of economics.
>>zsm_Latn<< McDonnell says he is determined to regain power from ‘anonymist directors' and ‘carleters' in utility companies.
>>zsm_Latn<< This shadow chancellor plan also means, the current stakeholders in the drinking water company may not get back his entire stock because the government of the Labor party can do 'dwelling' for reasons of perceived offence.
>>zsm_Latn<< He also ensures his plan to put the workers on the company's board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that will give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to employees, which will cost annual dividers up to £500.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told the α60 Minutes - whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views
>>zsm_Latn<< The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his own nomination in the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question of whether this finding of the bureau could affect senators from the Republicans to withdraw their support.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the interview that was shown on Sunday, the correspondent -60 Minutes - Scott Pelley asked Senator of the Republican Party. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find something that could make them change their minds.
>>zsm_Latn<< Kennedy seems to be more open than his colleagues from South Carolina.
- I'm sorry, of course, - Kennedy said.
- I told you to attend the trial, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
>>zsm_Latn<< I called him after this incident, the charge appeared, and said, 'You did it?'
>>zsm_Latn<< He is a firm, determined, firm-
>>zsm_Latn<< However, it seems that Graham's voice will not be changed.
- My mind has decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger charge to change it, he says.
>>zsm_Latn<< dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I know is: Brett strongly disagrees with it, - Graham adds, while referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
- And everyone she calls by her name can't verify it.
He was 36 years old.
>>zsm_Latn<< I don't see any new changes -
>>zsm_Latn<< What does the Global Citizen Festival mean and Has this event Done Something to Reduce Poverty?
>>zsm_Latn<< On Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a star string that performs very impressive, and also an effective mission; ending poverty in the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival would be a witness of tens of thousands of people coming round to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy action from Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the purpose of this actual event that ended extreme poverty in 2030.
>>zsm_Latn<< Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against poverty.
>>zsm_Latn<< In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay a VIP ticket), the concert visitor must complete a series of tasks or αactions - such as being volunteer, sending email to world leaders, calling, or other means to help increase awareness of their purpose of ending poverty.
>>zsm_Latn<< But how successful has Global Citizen been during these 12 years in achieving its goal?
>>zsm_Latn<< Is the idea of granting a gift of a free concert the right way to invite people to do an action, or is it just another case called -clickivism - people feel like they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
>>zsm_Latn<< Since 2011, Global Citizen has said to have recorded more than 19 million-actions - of its supporters, encouraging to set other goals.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is said that this action has helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion that would influence over 2.25 billion people in 2030.
>>zsm_Latn<< By the beginning of 2018, this group has collected 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, at least $10 billion of which have been passed or undertaken fund raisers.
>>zsm_Latn<< This group estimates that so far safe funds have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in England which consists of investors and implements committed to - help children grow to their maximum potential, ← promise will give Rwanda $35 million to help end nutrition deficiency in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
>>zsm_Latn<< With the support of the British government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice regarding this lack of nutrition a record of foot in history, - the ambassador The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told a crowd of people while a live concert in London in April 2018.
>>zsm_Latn<< The group also said that after over 5,000 actions were taken to increase nutrients for mothers and children in England, the government announced funds for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrients.
>>zsm_Latn<< Answer one of the questions in the General Question on their website that asks - what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty -
>>zsm_Latn<< Global Citizen replied: : ← This would be a long and difficult course - sometimes we would fall and fail.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we are united we will become stronger.
>>zsm_Latn<< Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the stars performing on this year's event in New York, which will be guided by Devora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
>>zsm_Latn<< The U.S. can use the Navy as αblicade - to inhibit Russia's energy export - Secretary of the Interior
>>zsm_Latn<< If necessary - Washington could ask for naval help to prevent Russia's energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State, Ryan Zinke revealed, as cited by Washington Examiner.
>>zsm_Latn<< Zinke strongly suspects that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it operates on legitimate government invitations - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
- I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be a total of energy, just as they do in eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe, she reports.
>>zsm_Latn<< And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
>>zsm_Latn<< The United States had that ability, with our Navy, to ensure open sea lanes, and, if necessary, to perform blockades, to ensure that their energy could not enter the market, he said.
>>zsm_Latn<< Zinke speaks in front of the event participants held by the Consumment Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that refers to himself as the α voice of energy customers » in the US.
>>zsm_Latn<< He compared the approaches Washington made in deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
>>zsm_Latn<< The economic choice in Iran and Russia was more or less, utilizing and replacing fuel, she said, while referring to Russia as one of the experts in the field - with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
>>zsm_Latn<< This statement emerged as the representative of Trump's government was performing a mission in order to increase their liquid natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
>>zsm_Latn<< To that end, Trump government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from Nord Stream 2's oil factory pipeline project which was not appropriate - which, according to Trump, made Berlin as the laughing- Moscow.
>>zsm_Latn<< Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 oil factory project is worth $11 billion, designed to double the capacity of the existing oil mill to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Kremlin argued that Washington's hard resistance to this project was merely driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
>>zsm_Latn<< I'm sure we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for doing the pressure and that customers should be able to select their own suppliers, - said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
>>zsm_Latn<< This U.S. attitude has attracted reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to this project.
>>zsm_Latn<< The leading industrial organization of Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), had asked the US not to interfere in the European Union's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
>>zsm_Latn<< -I would face a big problem if the third country mixed up our energy supply, - said Dieter Kempf, head of Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

- It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, including placing women in the top position, - as he says to The Hill.
- After November 6, I'll take a look at the situation as the president's appointment.
>>zsm_Latn<< Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning in the town hall, saying that he/she brought this region in the wrong direction.
- I'm very worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy, he said.
>>zsm_Latn<< Warren balks in delivering his criticism of Trump and the future head of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
>>zsm_Latn<< In a tweet on Friday, Warren said -Of course we need the FBI investigation before doing the polling--
>>zsm_Latn<< However, a poll released on Thursday, showed that most Warren's own constituents did not want him to nominate himself in 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< Fifty-eight per cent of the -mayly - voters in Massachusetts say it's best for senators not to nominate themselves, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.

>>zsm_Latn<< 18 states, D.C. supports challenges to new asylum policies
>>zsm_Latn<< Eight states and District of Columbia supported legal challenges to new U.S. policies that rejected asylum for victims who fled gang or domestic violence.
>>zsm_Latn<< Representatives of 18 states and these districts filed a friend-of-the-court briff on Friday in Washington to support the asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
>>zsm_Latn<< The full name of Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not yet been revealed.
>>zsm_Latn<< He said his partner - and his son who was a violent gang member,  have abused him, yet U.S. officials refused his asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
>>zsm_Latn<< The state jurisdiction that supported Grace describes El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced asylum applicants with large amounts to the U.S., as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
>>zsm_Latn<< The new U.S. asylum policy retreated with the 2014 Imigrant Board's decision to allow dark immigrants to escape domestic violence to file for asylum.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Supreme District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy - disregards state, federal, and international laws that have existed over the past several decades -
>>zsm_Latn<< The federal law requires that all claim of asylum be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances relating to that claim, and such prohibitions violate the principle,[friend-of-the court brief his word.

>>zsm_Latn<< The U.S. major land accuses China of 'doing commidation' with ' propaganda advertising'
>>zsm_Latn<< A week after China's official newspaper contained a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily that called the U.S. trade-T.-Tikkok lead advantage, U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
>>zsm_Latn<< U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday last referred to China Daily's paid supplement in Des Moines Register - the latest newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on 6 Nov., an accusation disputed by China.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the election in the US, which marked what U.S. officials said to Reuters, was a new phase in the increase of Washington's campaign to suppress China.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although it is a common thing for foreign governments to put advertising in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an ever increasing trade war, which makes them raise import rates to each other.
>>zsm_Latn<< China's retaliation rates at the beginning of this trade war were designed to strike exporters in states such as Iowa that supported the Trump Republic Party, says Chinese and U.S. experts.
>>zsm_Latn<< Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor who led Iowa, the main exporter of farm goods to China, said Beijing had harmed the workers, farmers, and business workers in America.
>>zsm_Latn<< China, Branstad wrote an opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, - now doubles the essence by running propaganda advertisements on our own free media ]
>>zsm_Latn<< In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the highly valued tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of press in America by loading paid advertisements in Des Moines Register, ← Branstad writes.
>>zsm_Latn<< —In contrast, in the street newspaper stalls here, in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and will not see the actual reflections of the different opinions that Chinese people may have concerning the problematic Chinese economic crossing, given the media existed under the control of the Communist Party of China, — write it.
>>zsm_Latn<< He added that - one of China's most prominent media rejects an offer to publish - his article, although he does not mention which newspaper.
>>zsm_Latn<< Warning Analysts, Republicans Avoid Women's Choices Toward Half-Time Selection With Kavanaugh Disasters
>>zsm_Latn<< Since the issue of important people in the Republican Party who stood up and defended the future head of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of some accusations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see the attack back, especially from women, on the upcoming half-time general election.
>>zsm_Latn<< Emotions over this issue are very high, and most Republican members are recorded to have already shown that they want to advance on voting.
>>zsm_Latn<< It could not be prevented, - Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Reeher said he doubted Senator's (R-Arizona) push Jeff Flake at the last minute to do FBI investigation would be sufficient to ease anger on voters.
>>zsm_Latn<< The bride will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November, ← Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn saying it on Friday, according to Washington's newspaper, D.C.
>>zsm_Latn<< On Friday morning, the demonstrants were rocking -November was near! - as they were performing demonstrations in the Senate hallway when the Republicans controlled the Justice Committee to continue to advance in the Kavanaugh no matter to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
>>zsm_Latn<< ← The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will emerge from the list, - the political analyst of Stu Rothenberg's non party, telling the news site.
- People say it's high enough; and it's true.
>>zsm_Latn<< But it could be higher, particularly among women's voice collectors in younger suburban areas and voters,18 to 29 years, which because they do not like the president, often don't give a vote ]
>>zsm_Latn<< Even before the public testimony Ford explained in detail the sexual abuse of himself by the future head of the Supreme Court, analysts restated there would be a counterattack that would follow if the Republican party kept pushing him forward with confirmation.
>>zsm_Latn<< This became a mess for the GOP, - said Michael Steele, former head of the Republican National Committee, early last week, to NBC News.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is not only about the election of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the reserve bench, it is also about how the Republican Party handles this issue and how they treat it, - Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, a group that helps to select the Democratic Party, points to the news channel.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, Americans like it will be divided about who should be trusted after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more favorable choice to the latter.
>>zsm_Latn<< A new poll conducted by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or may believe in Ford testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or may believe in Kavanaugh.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or actually lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said something similar about Ford.
>>zsm_Latn<< After the push from Flye, the FBI is currently investigating charges filed by Ford as well as one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ford testified under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh who was in a drunken state had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ramirez says that the headmaster of the Supreme Court showed her his shame while they attended a party while they were college in Yale in the 1980s.
>>zsm_Latn<< World Wide Web Developers Plan to Start a New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
>>zsm_Latn<< Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup trying to rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the Berners-Lee open source platform, Solid.
>>zsm_Latn<< Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
>>zsm_Latn<< In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the intent behind the Inrupt was the world-dominalist's -
- We have to start now, he said from startup.
>>zsm_Latn<< - This is a historic moment ? . . . . . . . . . . . . .
>>zsm_Latn<< This application uses Solid technology that allows people to create - their own personal online data storage - or PODs.
>>zsm_Latn<< This storage can contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
>>zsm_Latn<< Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.
>>zsm_Latn<< The unique one of this personal online data storage is that it is really up to the user who can access what kind of information.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the company it is known as the personal empowering through the data -
>>zsm_Latn<< The idea of setting up an Inrupt, according to the CEO of the company John Bruce, is that companies present the right resources, processes, and skills to use to help make Solid available to everyone.
>>zsm_Latn<< This company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, security platforms purchased by IBM, some staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community volunteer code maker.
>>zsm_Latn<< Beginning this week, technology developers around the world could make their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
>>zsm_Latn<< Berners-Lee says that he and his team did not talk to the ←Facebook and Google about whether or not would introduce or not a total change in which all their business models would actually be reversed overnight.
>>zsm_Latn<< We don't ask for their permission - . . . . . . . . . . . . .
>>zsm_Latn<< In a post in the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the \"immission Inrupt is to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid\"
>>zsm_Latn<< In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet as he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in network debate neutrality.
>>zsm_Latn<< Even while launching the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
>>zsm_Latn<< -I'm very optimistic about the next web era, - Berners-Lee adds.

>>zsm_Latn<< Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 on the attack at Bellenglishe and Lehacourt.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, four days later he was killed by the gunman and never learned that he had won the highest British military honor.
>>zsm_Latn<< A memorial stone was inaugurated by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.

>>zsm_Latn<< Imagine this, you have been awake all night to watch a busy 206 Bellator just to be denied watching the main event.
>>zsm_Latn<< San Jose's tag contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being shown directly throughout the night in England in Channel 5.
>>zsm_Latn<< At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Moussion and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in England was made stunned when his coverage turned into Peppa Pig.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some people feel unappreciated after they are engaged until early in the special day for the fight.
>>zsm_Latn<< A fan on Twitter describes the change to children's cartoons as a annoying αleluganous αααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααα
>>zsm_Latn<< This is a government rule, that at 6 o'clock the content was not suitable for displaying, so it was replaced with a children's program, ← said Dave Schwartz, vice president senior marketing and Bellator's communication, when asked about the transmission.
>>zsm_Latn<< - Peppa the pig, ya -
>>zsm_Latn<< The president of the Bellator Scott Coker company said that they would improve their scheduling by taking into account the audience in England in the future.
- I guess if we think about replaying, I think we might be able to solve it, - says Coker.
>>zsm_Latn<< -But now there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to fix it until our Sunday time, their Monday.
But we're working on it.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trust me, at the turn, a lot of text back and forth and everything isn't teaching.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
>>zsm_Latn<< We will reduce up to five fights only from six battles - as we usually do - and we will try to avoid excessive attraction for fans, and we are successful.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is a disadvantageal state -
>>zsm_Latn<< Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'low of self' related issues of sexuality
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom Daley's Olympic divergence said he grew up with low self-esteem due to his sexuality problem - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
>>zsm_Latn<< This 24-year-old man said he didn't realize it until he entered high school, that--not everyone like me--
>>zsm_Latn<< Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs delivered by Lauren Laverne, she says, she talks about the right of the homos to give - hope to others.
>>zsm_Latn<< He also says being a parent makes it not so concerned to win the Olympics.
>>zsm_Latn<< The usual host brings these long-run events, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off because of illness.
>>zsm_Latn<< Display as the people who are distracted on the first program of Laverne, Daley says he feels - less than - all the other people who grow up with it because - put on socially acceptable things to like men and women--
>>zsm_Latn<< He said: \"To this day, the feeling is less than the other, and the feeling is different, has become a manifest thing that gives me power and strength to succeed--
>>zsm_Latn<< He wants to prove that he is-something, he says, so he will not disappoint everyone as they learn about his sexuality problem.
>>zsm_Latn<< These two Olympic bronze medals have been the famous LGBT campaigner and used its appearance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries so as not to discriminate against homosexuals.
>>zsm_Latn<< He says, he speaks because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to hope - for others.
>>zsm_Latn<< The world champion three times said falling in love with a man - filmmaker from the U.S. Dustin Lance Black, whom he found in 2013 - - - shocks me -
>>zsm_Latn<< Daley married Oscar's slave who was 20 years older than this in the past year, and he said the age gap wasn't a problem.
>>zsm_Latn<< When you are experiencing so many problems at a very young age — she follows her first Olympics at the age of 14 and her father dies from cancer three years later - she says it is very hard to find someone with the same age that has the same scar tissue.
>>zsm_Latn<< The couple had been parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said--his whole perspective has changed.
- If you asked me last year, everything around 'I have to win the gold medal', she said.
You know, there's something bigger than just winning the Olympic gold medal.
>>zsm_Latn<< My Olympic gold medal is Robbie-
>>zsm_Latn<< His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
>>zsm_Latn<< Daley says his father can't accept that he will die, and one of the last things he asks is whether they've already got a ticket for London's 2012 Olympics - because he wants to sit in the front row.
>>zsm_Latn<< -I can't tell him 'you won't sit in the front row of the father',' he said.
>>zsm_Latn<< -I hold his hand as he stops breathing and still hasn't actually stopped breathing until he dies, I finally admit that he is unsustainable, - he says.
>>zsm_Latn<< The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
- All I know is, this is what I dream of all my life - to dive in front of the crowd at the Olympic Games, no better feeling than that, he said.

>>zsm_Latn<< Mickelson took the role of being suggested on Ryder Cup on Saturday
>>zsm_Latn<< American golfer Phil Mickelson will record the record on Sunday as he plays the 47th Ryder Cup game, yet he must change the role of avoiding unpleasant achievement.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mickelson, who played in a two-year event to record a 12th record, was proposed by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball game and a fourth group on Saturday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, this major winner five times divides his time between being a cheer driver and doing his game at that range, in hopes of improving what has made it difficult.
>>zsm_Latn<< Never become the most straight golfer though while being at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man is not suitable to follow a very strict course in Le Golf National, which routinely gives long and rough punishment for each wrong shot.
>>zsm_Latn<< And for his own field, it was not quite scary for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, to face the very accurate French champion Francesco Molinari, who had worked with the new arrival of Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
>>zsm_Latn<< If this American golfer, starts 12 single games with four points below, starting them with a hot start, then the Mickelson game proves to be very important.
>>zsm_Latn<< Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
- He really understands his role today, beats my back and hugs me, and says he'll be ready for the game tomorrow, - says Furyk.
- She's so confident.
>>zsm_Latn<< He was the Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
>>zsm_Latn<< I imagine the others, but that's how to play and that's the way we think we should go.
>>zsm_Latn<< He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people -
>>zsm_Latn<< Mickelson will pass a record of Nick Faldo for the most played Ryder Cup game, on Sunday.
>>zsm_Latn<< This could mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup which would never equal the height of his individual record.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mickelson missed 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven times series, although Furyk said his presence brought some things that could not be said on the team.
- He's funny, he's sharp, he's a joke, he's a fan, and he's a cool guy in the team room, he's saying.
- I think younger players have fun with him, this week too, that's pretty fun to see.
>>zsm_Latn<< She gives a lot of things, more than just playing--
>>zsm_Latn<< European Captain Thomas Bjorn knew great superiority could soon disappear
>>zsm_Latn<< Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, learned from the experience that a person who leads quite large towards his last single match at Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant trip.
>>zsm_Latn<< Dane made his first debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, with the captain of the Seven Ballesteros team holding the superiority of five points over America, yet had just touched the finish line with their nose with the thinst margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
>>zsm_Latn<< You keep reminding yourself that we get a great advantage at Valderrama; we get a great advantage at Brookline, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we win, but just, » Bjorn's word, takes a picture, after watching the Class of 2018, winning 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll enter a really boring game.
>>zsm_Latn<< Get out and do all the right things.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is not over until you get points on the whiteboard.
>>zsm_Latn<< We have a target, and the target is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
>>zsm_Latn<< I have long said, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are also very aware of what is on the other side - the greatest players in the world -
>>zsm_Latn<< It's nice to see the players playing on a hard golf field, Bjorn adds: ← In this case I will never advance myself.
Tomorrow is a different star.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tomorrow, individual players will progress, and this is a different thing to do.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is very happy to be out there with a partner when everything goes well, but if you are out there playing individually, then your ability as a golfer will be tested completely.
>>zsm_Latn<< That's the message you have to deliver to all players, getting out of your best for tomorrow's match.
>>zsm_Latn<< Now, you leave your partner and she has to go out to get out the best of her's--
>>zsm_Latn<< In contrast with Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his player to play better individually than they did as a ya coupleann, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
>>zsm_Latn<< Furyk himself had been at both ends of the final day of the big game, having been part of the team that won at Brookline before ending with defeat as Europe was performing - The miracle in Medicah--
>>zsm_Latn<< —I remember every one of those words,--he said answers the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players toward the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you see at Brookline, as you see in Medina.
>>zsm_Latn<< When the momentum runs one direction, it will give a great deal of pressure on the middle game.
>>zsm_Latn<< We also organize the list of players and put people in a variety of ways that we think, you know, we are trying to do a miracle tomorrow-
>>zsm_Latn<< Thomas has been given the task of attempting to lead resistance against Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players are in the top order.
- I'm going with a group of these people in order like this because I think I can close all the way, - Bjorn says about his single choice.
>>zsm_Latn<< The new German warship was suspended again
>>zsm_Latn<< The latest German Navy guards were supposed to have begun duty in 2014 to replace the old Cold War era warship, but the ship would not be there at least to the next year due to the wrong system and its rising costs, local media reported.
>>zsm_Latn<< —Rheinland-Pfalz's assignment, - the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class guardship, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing military spokesman.
>>zsm_Latn<< The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post delivery problem had disturbed the fate of this ambitious project.
>>zsm_Latn<< The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships that had already been ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come in place of the old Bremen class guardship.
>>zsm_Latn<< The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of flying anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as some signed technologies, such as radar deletions, infrareds, and acoustic keys.
>>zsm_Latn<< Other important features include longer periods of care - it should be possible to use the latest guardship for two years away from the port of its origin.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, the continual delay meant this sophisticated warship - said to allow Germany to highlight its power abroad - would be obsolete at the time of its beginning to enter its assignment time, Die Zeit noted.
>>zsm_Latn<< The infamous F125 guardship had been a notice last year, when the German Navy officially refused to assign the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss harbor in Hamburg.
>>zsm_Latn<< This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after the shipment.
>>zsm_Latn<< Only a few reasons are known behind the return of the ship, however the German media cited a number -cacating of software and hardware - which is important that makes the warship useless if used for battle missions.
>>zsm_Latn<< Software painting is important because the Baden-Weerttemberg class ship will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the labor on the older Bremen class warship.
>>zsm_Latn<< It was also known that the boat's weight was extremely excessive that would reduce its performance and limit the ability of the Navy to add updates in the future.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rheinland-Pfalz - with this 7,000 tons weight is believed to be twice as heavy as the ship with the same class that Germany used in World War II.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to broken hardware, the cost of production of the entire project - including crew training - is also a problem.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is said to rise surprisingly to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the beginning €2.2 billion.
>>zsm_Latn<< The problem that surrounded this latest guardship became very important in view of the latest warning as there was a shrinking to the strength of the German navy.
>>zsm_Latn<< Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee admitted that the Navy was actually - run out of the ship with the ability to spread out--
>>zsm_Latn<< The official said as the time of the problem grew, as the old ships were no longer in use but no replacement ships were provided.
>>zsm_Latn<< He regrets that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class guards could join the Navy.
>>zsm_Latn<< National Trust listens secretly to the secret life of bats
>>zsm_Latn<< A new research was done at a plantation in the Scottish High Plain aimed at uncovering how bats used natural stars in their food hunting.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hopefully this findings will provide new light regarding this unique flying mammal's behavior and help guide conservation activity in the future.
>>zsm_Latn<< This study conducted by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland would follow the common and sopran pupestelle as well as long-winged brown bat and Daubenton at Inverwe Gardens in Wester Ross.
>>zsm_Latn<< Special recorders will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
>>zsm_Latn<< The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct a cellular survey using a hand detector.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sound players that analyze all recordings will ensure the frequency of bat calls and which species do what activity.
>>zsm_Latn<< Then maps and habitat reports will be made to create images with a detailed scale of natural stars about their behavior.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rob Dewar, a natural conservation advisor for NTS, hopes this result will uncover which habitat area is most important to the bat and how each species use it.
>>zsm_Latn<< This information will help determine what benefits come from habitat management work such as lawn making and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
>>zsm_Latn<< The bat population in Scotland and across England has decreased sharply in recent centuries.
>>zsm_Latn<< This bat is threatened with the presence of development and development work that influences the hive and loss of habitats.
>>zsm_Latn<< Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, such as sticky paper suspended to trap bats as well as the chemical care of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
>>zsm_Latn<< Actually the bat is not blind.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes in terms of catching prey.
>>zsm_Latn<< They use sophisticated echo location techniques to find insects appropriately and barriers on their flying pathways.
>>zsm_Latn<< NTS, responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 760,000 acres of land across the country, is deeply concerned about bats.
>>zsm_Latn<< Have ten trained experts' energy, who regularly conduct surveys, hive inspections, and sometimes rescue efforts.
>>zsm_Latn<< The organization has also established the first and only natural fern in Scotland at the Threeave plantation in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
>>zsm_Latn<< David Thompson's plantation manager said the plantation was a suitable region for the bat.
- Here in Threeave, we have a nice place for bats, he said.
- We have ancient buildings, many old trees, and all good habitats.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, there are still many things we don't know about bats, so, the work we do here and on other properties will help us get a better understanding of what they need to develop--
>>zsm_Latn<< He emphasizes the importance of bat-checking before doing maintenance within the property, as there is unknown there is the possibility of destruction of a nesting nest can kill up to 400 female bats and the young, which may destroy the entire local population.
>>zsm_Latn<< The bat is protected and killed, harassing, or disrupting, or destroying its nest is illegal.
>>zsm_Latn<< Elisabeth Ferrrell, Scotland's official for the Trust Deaf Conservation, has encouraged the general public to come to help.
>>zsm_Latn<< He said: \"We still have to learn a lot about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their population fates are-
Ronaldo who rejected rape claims is preparing a lawyer to sue the German magazine
>>zsm_Latn<< The Christian Ronaldo calls the rape claim upon himself as a false newsman, and says that people-will want to promote themselves - by using his name.
>>zsm_Latn<< The lawyer will demand the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which outlines the charges.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Portuguese and Juventus attackers were charged with rape of an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
>>zsm_Latn<< He was then expected to have paid him for $35,000 to keep his mouth shut regarding this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Speaking in Instagram's Direct Broadcasting video to 142 million of his followers a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33 years old, denounced the report as a \"false news news\".
- No, no, no, no.
>>zsm_Latn<< What they say today is a false news, - the Ballon winner d'Or five times this said it to the camera.
- They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's a common thing.
>>zsm_Latn<< They wanted to be famous by calling on my name, but it was part of the job.
>>zsm_Latn<< I'm a happy man and everything is fine, - the player adds with a smile.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charge, which they refer to as the english reporting of suspicion in an unacceptable privacy field, - according to Reuters.
>>zsm_Latn<< Christian Lawyer Schertz said it would ask for compensation as - replace the moral loss in the amount that corresponds to the weight of the offence, which may be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the past few years-
>>zsm_Latn<< The accused incident was said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
>>zsm_Latn<< After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported back to the player's room, where he is presumed to have raped him, according to a report filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
>>zsm_Latn<< Majora says Ronaldo kneels after the accused incident and tells him that α99 per cent - he is a good - a good man - who disappoints only - a percent -
>>zsm_Latn<< The document said that Ronaldo justified that they both had sex, however it was on the basis of mutual desire.
>>zsm_Latn<< Majorga also said she went to the police station and had done a visum over her injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to solve the problem outside of the court because she felt-fearing would get the revenge » and worried » would be humiliated in public-
>>zsm_Latn<< This 34-year-old woman says now she is trying to undo the peace settlement because she is constantly experiencing trauma over the accused incident.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack was accused, and this summer he moved to the giant Italian Juve club with a €100 million deal.
>>zsm_Latn<< Brexit: England ‘will be sorry forever' for the loss of car makers
>>zsm_Latn<< England would be sorry for ever - if she lost her status as a world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, said Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
>>zsm_Latn<< He added - e.g.enai - Toyota, the British had told the BBC that if the British came out of the European Union without an agreement, for a while would stop production at his factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
- We need a deal, said Mr. Clark.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of border delays if there was no deal, would be detrimental to Brexit in terms of the cost of work.
>>zsm_Latn<< Factory in Burnaston - which made Auris and Avensis production Toyota - producing nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90% were exported throughout the European Union.
>>zsm_Latn<< —I think it would be if the British came out of the European Union at the end of March, we would see a stop to production at our factory, - said Marvin Cooke, director of the execution of Toyota in Burnaston.
>>zsm_Latn<< Other British car manufacturers have expressed their concerns about the exit of the European Union without agreement on how cross-line trade would run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
>>zsm_Latn<< BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini factory at Oxford a few months after Brexit.
>>zsm_Latn<< The main problem associated with what the car makers said was the risk of supply chain if there was no deal with Brexit.
>>zsm_Latn<< Toyota production presses are run based on the production principle - exactly time - with parts coming in every 37 minutes good from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for cars made according to orders.
>>zsm_Latn<< If the British came out of the European Union without an agreement on March 29, there would probably be interference on the border, which the industry thought could lead to delay and lack of parts.
>>zsm_Latn<< It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies more than one day at his factory in Derbyshire, the company's representative said, and thus production would be discontinued.
>>zsm_Latn<< Clark says the plan of Chequers Theresa May for relations with the European Union in the future is -dividation appropriately to avoid examinations on the border--
We have to have a deal, we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only to enjoy success at the moment, but for us to achieve this opportunity, - he said to the Today program of BBC Radio 4.
>>zsm_Latn<< ← Open it not only from Toyota but other manufacturers as well, that we should really be able to continue what has already become a very well-walking supply chain--
>>zsm_Latn<< Toyota cannot say how long its production will be stopped, but that which is clear in the long run, warns that the addition of costs will reduce the power of factory saing and will ultimately be detrimental in terms of the cost of work.
>>zsm_Latn<< Peter Tsouvallaris, who had been working in Burnaston for 24 years and was the director of Unite's union at the factory, said his members were already getting more and more worried: -Cuting my experience, so this work will never come back.
>>zsm_Latn<< The government spokesmen said:‘We have proposed a proper and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future ]
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may return delayed, following the White House
>>zsm_Latn<< Donald Trump's high risk meeting with the representative of High Commissioner Rod Rosenstein was able to enthusiastically reschedul the week again — as the battle of the royal court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White House said on Sunday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller's special advisory work, who is investigating Russia's intervention in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia's assistants, as well as potential hindering justice by the president.
>>zsm_Latn<< Whether Trump would fire the vice of the grand or not, which would endanger Mueller's freedom, has triggered gossip in Washington for months.
>>zsm_Latn<< Early this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been discussing using a telegram to record conversations with Trump and was likely to launch the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
>>zsm_Latn<< But last Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of the report that he was going to resign.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, meeting with Trump, who was at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump said he would - choose to not - fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was again pending to avoid confrontation with a hearing of the Senate justice committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual offenses, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both would give testimony.
>>zsm_Latn<< On Friday, Trump ordered an investigation of the FBI for one week on the claim against Kavanaugh, which next delayed the full vote of the Senate.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Secretary of Trump press, Sarah Sanders, performed on Fox News Sunday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: ‘Staying for that meeting has not been set up, it could be that within this week, I could see that backwarding it to another week is good as well as remembering the other things that happened in the great court.
But let's just look at it and I always want to deliver the latest news to the press.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some reporters will oppose the statement: Sanders have not held a press meeting in the White House since September 10.
>>zsm_Latn<< Chris Wallace's host asked him why.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sanders said the rare meeting was not due to a sense of dislike towards TV reporters — who tried to draw attention, ← though, he said: : ← I disagree with the fact that they were trying to draw attention )
>>zsm_Latn<< Then he proposes that direct contact between Trump and press be improved.
>>zsm_Latn<< —Presidents do more sessions of direct question than the previous presidents's, — he adds without mentioning the evidence: ← We've already seen those numbers -
>>zsm_Latn<< The meeting will still take place, said Sanders, yet -if the press has the opportunity to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
>>zsm_Latn<< We are trying to do it more often and you have seen much of us do it in these last few weeks and it will replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States--
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump regularly asks questions while leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting high officials.
>>zsm_Latn<< Single press conferences are rare.
>>zsm_Latn<< This week in New York, the president may point out the reason, performing a free and sometimes strange appearance before the reporters gather.
>>zsm_Latn<< Health secretary writes to European Union workers in the NHS Scotland regarding concerns over Brexit's problems
>>zsm_Latn<< Health Secretary has written a letter to the staff of the European Union working at the NHS Scotland to express the gratitude of the state and hopefully they will still be working here after Brexit's problem.
>>zsm_Latn<< Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until England withdrew from the European Union.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Scottish government has committed to meeting permanent status advance costs for European Union citizens who work in transfer public services.
>>zsm_Latn<< In his letter, Ms Freeman wrote: \"During the summer, negotiations between the British and the European Union regarding this withdrawal are still continuing, approaching the expected decision in this fall.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the British government was also ready for the possibility of scenario without any agreement.
I know this must be very disturbing to all of you.
>>zsm_Latn<< That is why I now want to reaffirm how much I deeply appreciate the contributions of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
>>zsm_Latn<< Colleges from all over the European Union, and others, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health care work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
>>zsm_Latn<< Scotland is really your house and we really want you to keep you here--

>>zsm_Latn<< Foreign buyers will be charged with higher cost of materi as they buy property in England, along with the extra money that will be used to help homeless according to the new Tory plan
>>zsm_Latn<< This step will hold the success rate of Corbyn's movement in attracting young voters
>>zsm_Latn<< The increase in the cost of these batteries will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in England
>>zsm_Latn<< The Department of Finance estimates that it will collect up to £120 million per year- to help homeless people
>>zsm_Latn<< Foreign buyers will be subjected to higher mammals as they buy property in England - along with the extra money that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce it today.
>>zsm_Latn<< This step will be seen as an attempt to withstand the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts in attracting young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high income.
>>zsm_Latn<< The increase in the cost of the material will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in England, along with the additional money that encourages the Government's efforts to combat the blockade.
>>zsm_Latn<< Additional costs - which are additional costs at the current cost of mamerials, including higher levels introduced two years ago on the purchase of second house and home purchases for rent - can reach three percent.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Financial Department expects this movement to rise to £120 million per year.
>>zsm_Latn<< An estimated 13 percent of the newly built property in London was purchased by non-English residents, which led to a rise in prices and made it increasingly difficult for the first buyer to tread his feet on the housing ladder.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many of the rich areas of this country - usually in the capital - have become the city of ghosts - due to the large number of foreign buyers that spend most of their time abroad.
>>zsm_Latn<< This new policy came out only a week after Boris Johnson called for the cuts in the cost of the matarian to help more young people have their first home.
>>zsm_Latn<< He accuses the large construction company of maintaining a high property price by buying land but not using it, and urges Mrs May to ignore quotas for affordable homes in order to fix the house's » in England.
>>zsm_Latn<< Corbyn has announced a series of reform proposals in an interesting housing area, including rent surveillance and ending the infertility — no guilt-
>>zsm_Latn<< He also wanted to empower the council to build new houses.
>>zsm_Latn<< May said: ‘Last time I promised I would dedicate the prime minister to restore the English dream - that life should be better for every generation.
>>zsm_Latn<< And that means fixing our crowded housing market.
>>zsm_Latn<< England will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build lives here.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, it is not proper for individuals who do not live in England, as well as overseas-based companies, to buy homes as easy as British people already work hard.
>>zsm_Latn<< For many people the dream of having a house becomes something very far away, and the treatment is not fair against the fixed block of real--
>>zsm_Latn<< Jack Ross: 'My main assembly is leading the Scottish team'
>>zsm_Latn<< The Sunderland boss, Jack Ross says his main-ambiciation - is to be a Scottish manager on several stages.
>>zsm_Latn<< The 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently occupies the third rank in League One, a three-point deviation from the top position.
>>zsm_Latn<< He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Last Scottish Premier League.
- I want to defend my country as a player.
>>zsm_Latn<< I got a B hat and that's her, - Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
- But I was big and often watched a Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it was always something that appealed to me to return.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, the chance will come, if I succeed in team management :
>>zsm_Latn<< Sunderland managers before Ross include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
>>zsm_Latn<< This former boss of Alloa Athletic said he felt no dread following a trail of great names in the club as large as that, after earlier declined an offer from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
>>zsm_Latn<< For me, the present success would be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
>>zsm_Latn<< Because of the structure and facilities that are in this club, there is no doubt to be in the Premier League, he says.
>>zsm_Latn<< —Not an easy task to be there, but I might only see myself as a successful person here, if I could bring this club back there--
>>zsm_Latn<< Ross's career in team management was only three years, after some time as a boss assistant in Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coaching staff in Hearts.
>>zsm_Latn<< Then he helped Alloa recover from the degradation to the third position, and turned St Mirren from the degradation rush into the winner of the Championship's title in the following season.
>>zsm_Latn<< And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he has ever done during his career at Clyde, Hartletool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
- It's probably the intersection I've got to go through, - remember it while taking over Alloa.
- I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
>>zsm_Latn<< It sounds strange because I'm fine, make a living in a reasonable way, and enjoy some reasonable things.
>>zsm_Latn<< But playing can be difficult.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many things you have to go through each week.
>>zsm_Latn<< I still experience it in terms of job pressure, yet in the management of the feeling is fine.
>>zsm_Latn<< I always want to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt throughout my adult life -
>>zsm_Latn<< You can hear his complete interview at Sportsound on Sunday, September 30, at Scottish Radio between 12.00 and 13.00 BST

>>zsm_Latn<< Summer waves have increased the revenue of pub-pubs in England who are struggling to survive, yet more pressure is exerted on restaurant networks.
>>zsm_Latn<< Figures indicate, pub and bar groups saw a 2.7 percent rise in sales in July - but income in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
>>zsm_Latn<< Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who compiled those numbers, said: \"The sun that shines warm and British participation in the World Cup is longer than expected means, the July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where pub's income increases by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that get hard comfort.
>>zsm_Latn<< The downward trade of restaurants by 1.8 percent in June will be worse in July.
>>zsm_Latn<< The sale of pubs and bars that sell drinks so far shows the most powerful than what happens in the down restaurant.
>>zsm_Latn<< Pubs that sell food also suffer from the heat of the sun, though not as much as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just come out for a drink.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sales across the pub and the busiest bar that sell drinks up 6.6 percent for this month, with which sell food down three percent -
>>zsm_Latn<< Paul Newman, a recreational analyst and RSM talker said: \"This results in a trend that we have seen since April.
>>zsm_Latn<< Weather and impact of social events or large sports remain the biggest factor involving market sales outside the home.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is not surprising that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales from year to year will be very painful over the pressure of the cost being happening.
>>zsm_Latn<< A long summer shouldn't come at the time the operator who sells food experiences bad times, and time will tell if a good enough temperature that we already enjoy in August will give a little rest that is needed--
>>zsm_Latn<< The total growth of sales throughout the pub and restaurants, including the newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, showing slowdown on brand launch.
>>zsm_Latn<< Peach Tracker industry sales monitoring for the pub, bars, and restaurants in England collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined omset of over £9 billion, and is an unconquered industrial gauge.

>>zsm_Latn<< A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid development of false -Insta accounts - a reference to photo sharing sites in Instagram.
>>zsm_Latn<< The news has increased the concerns it will post sexual content.
>>zsm_Latn<< Twenty percent of students say they operate on the account -atom — already cleaned up to be shown to parents, while also having personal accounts.
>>zsm_Latn<< A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, found a teenager who asked someone else to--punish me--

>>zsm_Latn<< Doyle has been chosen to enter the Scottish Atlantic council as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the manager board.
>>zsm_Latn<< Doyle is the most prestigious Scottish athletic and field marked by honor and the leader Ian Beattie described this movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the field of sports to benefit from its various experiences at the international level over the past few decades.
>>zsm_Latn<< Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the council, - said Beattie.
>>zsm_Latn<< Doyle said: - I act as a voice for athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland-

I can't walk.
>>zsm_Latn<< The doctor said it was only the time that could determine whether I could recover and to which degree of recovery.

>>zsm_Latn<< The idea of a breast pump comparing mother to cow has split opinions in the online world
>>zsm_Latn<< The pump company has split opinions in the online world with an advertisement that compares the mother nursing with the milked cow.
>>zsm_Latn<< To mark the launch of a so-called product as the focal point that can be worn with the first silent in the world, - the consumer technology company Elvie released an inspired advertisement from a video of noisy music to show this new pumped freedom to express a mother.
>>zsm_Latn<< Four of the mothers dance in the barn containing cow straw follows a song that includes lyrics like this: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
>>zsm_Latn<< Continued with refraction: - The pumps out, the pumps out, I feed them dear, pump out, pump out, I give my woman's milk-
>>zsm_Latn<< However, advertisements that have been published on this company's Facebook page have caused online controversy.
>>zsm_Latn<< With 770,000 seen and hundreds of comments, this video has received a variety of reactions from viewers, with many who say this is making -gangerian - in the milk processing industry.
>>zsm_Latn<< - A very bad decision using a cow to advertise this product.
>>zsm_Latn<< Just as we are, the cow must also be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless the baby is stolen from them within a few days after giving birth, - write someone.
>>zsm_Latn<< Elvie breast pumps are very fitting in BH breast milking (Elvie/Mom)
>>zsm_Latn<< Another comment: -Trauma that can be understood well for mother and baby.
>>zsm_Latn<< But yes why don't use it to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have to keep the baby's--
>>zsm_Latn<< Another adds: - An advertisement that loses its meaning -
>>zsm_Latn<< The other person defends the advertisement, with a woman admitting that she found the song -lucu--
- I think it's a genius.
I'll buy it if I'm still nursing.
Empress makes me feel exactly like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I accept it for what it's.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is a product that is genius, » write someone.
>>zsm_Latn<< Others comment: ‘This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who are scratching (often at their place of work or toilet) and who feel like -supani-
>>zsm_Latn<< This is not an advertisement that commends or judges the milking industry -
>>zsm_Latn<< At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with hidden pumps trapped inside their bra.
>>zsm_Latn<< The basic concept of this campaign comes from the insight of many women who blackmail the ASI who say they feel kayak like a cow.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, Elvie Pump is completely bright, without cables or tubes and pas within the bra sucks, which gives women the freedom to move, grind their baby, and even go out while squeezeing.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ana Balarin, a partner and an ECD in Mother commented: - The Elvie pump is a product of a prospective pioneer launched with convincing and provocating.
>>zsm_Latn<< By comparing the picture between expressing women and cattle we want to pump the ASI and all its challenges obstacles, as well as showing it through a way of comforting and fun with the full freedom that the new pumps offer.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is not the first time the Elvie pump became the main news.

>>zsm_Latn<< Hundreds of Child Migrants Move Quietly to Tent in Texas Borders
>>zsm_Latn<< The number of children detained is increasing even though the monthly border invasion remains unchanged, partly as a result of the harsh statements and policies introduced by Trump's government that make it difficult to discipline children with sponsors.
>>zsm_Latn<< Basically, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and are afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in that country by stepping forward to save children.
>>zsm_Latn<< The risk increased in June, as the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household they had to hand over fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
>>zsm_Latn<< Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in the field of Immigration and Bea Cukai, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor the underage child.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Society then ensures that 70 percent of those arrested have no history of criminal records.
- Almost 80 percent of those who become sponsors or members of sponsors are illegal in this country, and most of them are evil foreigners.
So we keep hunting those people, after Mr. Albance.
>>zsm_Latn<< Determined to process children more quickly, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to be present in court within a period of one month after being held, not after 60 days, which became the former standard, the speaker of the camp.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most of them perform through the call of video conferences, not directly, to appeal their legal status case to immigration judges.
>>zsm_Latn<< Those deemed unworthy of getting help will be immediately deported.
>>zsm_Latn<< The longer the children are held, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in an increase in violence or escape efforts, the speech of the workers where shelters and system reports received in the last few months.
>>zsm_Latn<< The lawyers say the concern increases in larger facilities such as Tornillo, whose signs exist in a struggling child tend to be ignored, due to its size.
>>zsm_Latn<< They speak that moving children to camp towns without providing enough emotional time preparation for them or saying goodbye to his friends can exacerbate the trauma that has been so much fought.
>>zsm_Latn<< Syria asked the 'occupied brothers' from the U.S., France and Turkey to immediately retreat
>>zsm_Latn<< At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war had now entered the eighth year.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mukalem, who also served as prime minister's representative, said foreign troops occupied Syria's land illegally, for the reason of combating terrorism, and - would have been dealt with in a legitimate manner-
>>zsm_Latn<< - They should step back immediately and without any requirement, - the confession to the assembly.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mukalem asserted that the war against terror was almost over - in Syria, where over 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than a million people fleeing from their homes.
>>zsm_Latn<< He asserted that Damascus would continue - combating this sacred battle until we cleansed all regions of Syria - from a group of terror and the presence of illegal foreign soldiers ]
>>zsm_Latn<< The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, particularly training and influencing Kurdish and Syrian Arab troops who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in war - torn regions.
>>zsm_Latn<< Regarding the problem of refugees, Mukalem affirms that it is best for them to come back, and he blames - some western countries - because -eassifying tremendous fear - which motivates refugees to get away more and more.
- We have asked international society and human organizations to facilitate this return, - after it.
>>zsm_Latn<< - They composite what should be the problem of humanity fully - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
>>zsm_Latn<< The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until political treaty agreed between Assad and opposition to end the war.
>>zsm_Latn<< The UN diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large fortress of Idlib rebels has resulted in an opportunity to continue political talk.
>>zsm_Latn<< The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive attack from Russian-supported Syrian forces in the province, where there were three million people living.
>>zsm_Latn<< But Mukalem asserted that the treaty had a clearly-fortified time - and gave rise to the hope that military action would target mujahids including fighters from Front Nusra associated with Al-Qaeda, who would have been destined to be seized ]
>>zsm_Latn<< The UN Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly call for the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to make the post-war Act for Syria and open the way to elections.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mukalem presented the terms of the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, by asserting that panel work should be limited - to review the recent chapters of the Act, ← and warn against interference.
>>zsm_Latn<< Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
>>zsm_Latn<< According to the logic, Trump would win the elections again in 2020 except, because many liberal audiences hoped, accusations and scandals ended his presidency early.
>>zsm_Latn<< There is no doubt about it, -The most dramatic presidency ever existed! -
>>zsm_Latn<< To date, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since 2014, CNN's main clock ratings have increased more than twice as much as 1,05 million and MSNBC almost three times to 1.6 million.
>>zsm_Latn<< Fox News has an average of 2.4 million major clock viewers, an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC - The Rachel Maddow Show - has occupied the top of the cable TV rating with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the main news evening.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is a spirit that makes people interested because it is something that is not yet understood, - ujar Neal Baer, the actor of the ABC-Designed Survivor drama, - about cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed Capitol.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author -Just the Funny Parts: and Some Truths Difficult In Trading to Hollywood Boys  Club, have another theory.
>>zsm_Latn<< He remembered riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
>>zsm_Latn<< The driver said that he would grant his vote to Trump.
Why?
- She said, 'Cause she made me laugh, - Miss Scovell told me.
There is a conflict between what we should be doing and what we should be doing.
>>zsm_Latn<< Certainly, unlike any other event on TV, the storyline that emerged from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether the immigrant family could unite again and restore the global economy.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rather than that, the luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
>>zsm_Latn<< In that case, it is not just being a knowledgeable citizen at six o'clock you find yourself seeing a panel of experts debate the use of the back-source — Bob Woodward for his book titled -Fear, - wearing a camel's leather bomb jacket of Paul Manafort's worth $15,000 — thick clothing with pride, ← The Washington Post) and implications of the horror description of Storrs Daniels of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario the same again.

>>zsm_Latn<< A lot of money from the outside flooded the most strict half-time election competition in the White House
>>zsm_Latn<< only Pennsylvania 17 gained a flood of money, thanks to the re-congress district which distilled two platañas in the same seat struggle.
>>zsm_Latn<< The newly re-ordered Pittsburgh District, filed the Conor Lamb of Rep. Democrats - who won seats in another district through a special election last spring.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lamb advanced against another maphana, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, which now represents the old district of Pennsylvania 12, which overlaps with the new district of Pennsylvania 17.
>>zsm_Latn<< These maps were reordered after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January deciding that the old districts were unconstitutionally on the Republican party.
>>zsm_Latn<< The competition in the new district of Pennsylvania 17 has resulted in a large fund of campaigns between the financial side of the large party, Democratic Campaign Congressal Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
>>zsm_Latn<< Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in a special election of March which was monitored in general for the District of Congress 18 Pennsylvania.
>>zsm_Latn<< The chair had been occupied by Republican officials over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
>>zsm_Latn<< Political experts sent the Democratic party a bit superior.
>>zsm_Latn<< The U.S. Balanced El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Back
>>zsm_Latn<< The diplomats made sure that the Dominican and Panama Republic had already recognized Beijing, by giving little pressure from Washington.
>>zsm_Latn<< President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and ordered a hotel in Panama until the partner expelled the Trump Organization management team.
>>zsm_Latn<< Department officials decided to redraw the head of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over - the latest verdict which no longer acknowledges Taiwan, ← Heather Nauert, the department spokesman, is displayed in an early statement this month.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the punishment was only considered against El Salvador, who had received assistance about $140 million from America in 2017, including for narcotic control, development support and economy.
>>zsm_Latn<< The proposed punishment, which covers the restriction of financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, will hurt the Central American state and rise to unemployment rates and murder.
>>zsm_Latn<< When internal meetings take place, North American and Central American officials delay high-level conferences that focus on security and economic prosperity to follow the same year's meeting which is considered a step forward in order to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
>>zsm_Latn<< But in mid September, government officials asserted that they wanted a conference to be continued, in order to effectively end the consideration of punishment for El Salvador.
>>zsm_Latn<< Vice President Mike Pence was currently scheduled to give a speech in the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal the government made at the meeting, the diplomats' complement.
>>zsm_Latn<< And the three American messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing new reprimands or harsh punishments from Washington.
>>zsm_Latn<< A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate shown by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal consideration of this unclear situation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Their statements were reinforced by outside analysts who were close to the government and also spoke about these obscure circumstances.
>>zsm_Latn<< Study Story
>>zsm_Latn<< Another shocking story is Robert Mueller's special advisory report on the possibility of the court barriers of Mr. Trump, which is currently there is very important evidence in public records.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mr. Mueller's report also discussed his investigations as to whether Trump's campaign was collusioned with Russia in attacking our elections.
>>zsm_Latn<< When Congress moved in hand, Mr. Trump would be asked for accountability from him, just as he was preparing to go in front of the voters again, and may eventually become a jury of his partners.
>>zsm_Latn<< So there is still much to do, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Lord Trump's rule cannot be avoided - or its equality in Europe.
>>zsm_Latn<< There is a choice that we should make on both sides of the Atlantic which will influence how long we are fighting.
>>zsm_Latn<< In 1938, German officials were ready to commit a coup against Hitler, if only the West against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
>>zsm_Latn<< We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
>>zsm_Latn<< The beginning of history centered along such a point of deviation, and a speeded or delayed democracy march could not be avoided.
>>zsm_Latn<< American citizens are now facing some of these points of change.
>>zsm_Latn<< What should we do if Trump fires the Chief Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who is overseeing the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
>>zsm_Latn<< Rosenstein has been under pressure since this paper reported that, last year, she suggests to secretly record the president and argues that she is not eligible to serve the president.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times' account wasn't true.
>>zsm_Latn<< How do we respond if a new F.B.I. investigation Brett Kavanaugh was not complete or fair - or if he was filed to the Supreme Court even though there was strong accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
>>zsm_Latn<< And besides that, are we going to give a sound in half the time for Congress that will ask for Trump's accountability?
>>zsm_Latn<< If we fail to pass that test, democracy will become worse in the long run.
>>zsm_Latn<< But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
>>zsm_Latn<< My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had lived in my great embassy.
He survived, then migrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light the Sabbath candle on a swastika written table.
By leaving that legacy to me, how do I lose hope about our future?

>>zsm_Latn<< Rangers interviewed Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in support of victory over Austria, following good mining results in Spain against the early Villarreal of this month, would strengthen their position to escape the European League's G Group.
>>zsm_Latn<< The knee injuries make Graham Dorrans' middle bracelet unable to perform in this first season until the 2-2 mine results against Villarreal, however he is sure Rangers can utilize the result as a footstone towards greater employment.
- This is really good for us because Villarreal is a great team, - talk to a 31-year-old player.
- In this game we're sure we can get something and go by cutting one point.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the end, we may be able to do so but, according to us, the outcome of the balance may be a fair result.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the first round, they may perform better but in the second round, we rise up and become a better team.
>>zsm_Latn<< Following Thursday, tonight became another great day of Europe.
>>zsm_Latn<< We hope to be able to miss three points even though it will be a difficult game because they have good results in their last match, however, with the support of the exporter behind us, I'm sure we can continue to progress and get a positive result.
>>zsm_Latn<< Last year, we had a difficult time, as what happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself but there is currently an excellent hope in this club.

>>zsm_Latn<< The High Breed: What is the hip hop spirit?
>>zsm_Latn<< A group of trio hip hops want to challenge the genre's negative views by filling their music with positive messages.
>>zsm_Latn<< The High Breed, from Bristol, claimed the hip hop movement was away from the origin of political messages and paralyzed social issues.
>>zsm_Latn<< They want to return to its roots and make the hip hop spirit popular again.
>>zsm_Latn<< Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen recent resurrections in the UK through some artists such as Acala and Lowkey.

>>zsm_Latn<< NY watchdogs demand a couple for attacking after releasing a message - arational
>>zsm_Latn<< A New York custodyer demands one couple for having attacked in a discriminatory manner after receiving an indirect message from a mother who is complaining and stating that she's the other-black-
>>zsm_Latn<< The couple refused to be considered racist, and considered it more like -crowd-assembly-
>>zsm_Latn<< Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, shows her anxiety upon realizing that the new child's nurse, Giselle Maurice, was black as soon as she was on her first day of work in 2016.
>>zsm_Latn<< —DON'T HAVE SOME HITAM HIGHINY, - write his wife Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending her to her husband, she sends him to her Maurice, twice.
>>zsm_Latn<< After realizing his mistake, — which was not well-well-associated - Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, stating that they issued a guardian, who was a mixed African-American citizen, for he had done a bad job and he was more expecting the Philippines, based on the New York Post.
>>zsm_Latn<< Miss Maurice was paid for one day of his work and was then returned using Uber.
>>zsm_Latn<< Maurice now demands the couple to pay compensation for the dismissal, and asks for a compensation of about $350 a day for a period of six months, in exchange for a tenure job that he should initially work on, even without the presence of a contract.
- I want to show them, look, you can't do anything like that, - he said to the Post on Sunday, then added - I know it's a discrimination--
>>zsm_Latn<< The couple countered the claim that they claimed to be racist, stating the fired worker Maurice was a justified thing to do, they were worried that they could not trust him after offending him,
- My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist, Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
- But can you let your children be treated by someone you've abused, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.
>>zsm_Latn<< As wrapped - the same kind of force, ← the words of his wife Plasco just two months gave birth to her baby and was in the--the situation was very difficult--
You're going to pursue someone who is in such a condition?
>>zsm_Latn<< That's not a good thing to do, - the investment banker adds.
>>zsm_Latn<< As the legal case is still running, the general opinion court has made a quick denunciation of the couple on social media, blaming for their attitudes and logic.
>>zsm_Latn<< Paddington publisher worry readers won't relate to the speech bear, the new newspaper is revealed
>>zsm_Latn<< Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born not far after her book had been accepted, is explained in a letter. —It was difficult to just talk without knowing the position she was experiencing, reading it first before being published.
It's so funny to know as we know about Paddington's great success.
>>zsm_Latn<< Saying his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspirationing through childbook writing with bear toys, who was very optimistic about his work results that had been rejected, he added the date of the book publication that 60th felt - sweet-riered - after his father's death last year .
>>zsm_Latn<< For Paddington, which he described as a αmember is very important to our family,--he added his father quite proud of the end of his success.
>>zsm_Latn<< He is quite quiet, and he is not a proud man, he says.
- But because Paddington means so much to him, it's like you have a child who has reached something: you're proud of them even though not all of your efforts.
I think he looked at Paddington's success like that.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself »
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her via the phone.
>>zsm_Latn<< By the time it landed, her daughter was immediately taken to Nice Louis Pasteur's hospital 2, yet the doctors failed to save her.
>>zsm_Latn<< -Nad made a calm call to deliver it so bad that she was most likely not to survive, - said Mrs. Edna-Laperouse.
- Then I got a call from Nad that said he would die in the next couple of minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did it too.
I said, -Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
>>zsm_Latn<< The drugs that doctors have given to keep her heart beating continue slowly to collapse and leave her body system.
>>zsm_Latn<< He has died a few while the handling process takes place and everything feels deadly.
I can only sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
>>zsm_Latn<< I cannot shout, or shout or cry because I am in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it all up.
>>zsm_Latn<< Eventually Mrs. Edna-Laperouse, currently grieved for her daughter's loss, rode a plane along with other passengers - unaware of what she had been passing through.
- No one knows it, he says.
- My head fell backward and my tears kept dripping all the time.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is very difficult to explain, but at the time in that flight I felt such a deep sense of sympathy toward Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her.
>>zsm_Latn<< The grieving women posted cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
>>zsm_Latn<< Two women who lost their loved one tried to prevent others from committing suicide.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspirative messages and numbers that can be contacted to get support.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
- I don't want any parents to feel as I feel every day, she says.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a chef who promises a beautiful smile.
- Everyone knows him from his smile.
>>zsm_Latn<< They always say that his smile sheds light of the mood--
>>zsm_Latn<< But, he stopped working before he died, as he's--was in a very dark place--
>>zsm_Latn<< In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mrs. Davis said: ‘I'm constantly worried if there will be a continuous effect -
>>zsm_Latn<< Mrs. Davis made those cards--to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can approach and talk to, even if they are a friend.
>>zsm_Latn<< Don't sit down and keep quiet - you need to talk -
>>zsm_Latn<< Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
- She didn't say if she felt sad or depressed or anything, she said.
- A few days before our Christmas, there was a change in her behavior.
>>zsm_Latn<< He was in his lowest point on Christmas Day - as the children opened their gifts he did not see to their eyes or anything-
>>zsm_Latn<< He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they had to go through it: \"It made an ally in the family.
It separates us.
>>zsm_Latn<< But we have to pass through it and fight -

>>zsm_Latn<< The future Brett Kavanaugh was in uncertainty when the FBI began its investigation
>>zsm_Latn<< -I think, if we really get something like what he asks - an investigation limited to his time, restricted his coverage - we may be able to bring a little unity, ← Lord Flye's ujar on Saturday, adding that he fears the committee's harbor — in the midst of the council's ruling pile.
>>zsm_Latn<< Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
>>zsm_Latn<< Their refusal was all due to time.
>>zsm_Latn<< The legislative elections stayed five more weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans did poorly, they would become very weak on his chance to make the person they wanted selected sit in the highest court there.
>>zsm_Latn<< George W. Bush had contacted Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met with Ashley his wife, who was the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
>>zsm_Latn<< What happened after the FBI made the report?
>>zsm_Latn<< There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
>>zsm_Latn<< The number of North Korean pilots ‘anjlok' under Kim
>>zsm_Latn<< The number of people who split from North Korea to South Korea has decreased dramatically since Kim Jong-un was in power seven years ago, following a member of the United Korea parliament.
>>zsm_Latn<< Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South-forced ministry data, said there were 1,127 leaks last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mr. Park said the border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates collected by people smugglers were key factors.
>>zsm_Latn<< Pyongyang does not give public comments.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most predators from the North were eventually offered South Korea citizenship.
>>zsm_Latn<< Seoul said over 30,000 people from North Korea had illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most runs through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is more easily crossed than the Demiliterized Zone between the two Koreas.
>>zsm_Latn<< China treats predators as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return.
>>zsm_Latn<< The relationship between the North and the South - which is technically still in the war - has increased greatly in the last few months.
>>zsm_Latn<< At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on delayed denucleization negotiations.
>>zsm_Latn<< This happened after a historic meeting in June between the president of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
>>zsm_Latn<< But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of development since.
- If there were no trust in the US, there would be no confidence in our national security and in the situation, we wouldn't be able to drop our weapons on the side, ← Mr. Ri said in a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accuses Brett Kavanaugh -hissteris, — she says it's not suitable to serve in the Supreme Court.
>>zsm_Latn<< The head of the Party of the opposition of Nancy Pelosi accuses the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh -hissteris - and says he is not temperamentally suited to serve in the Supreme Court.
>>zsm_Latn<< Pelos made the comment in a Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
- I can't avoid thinking that if a woman had such a performance, they would say ‘hysterical', - The Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Kavanaugh emotionally denied the charge that he had committed sexual harassment against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
>>zsm_Latn<< In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost screaming and difficulty speaking when discussing his family and his years during high school.
>>zsm_Latn<< He also bluntly condemned Democrats in the committee, saying the charge against him was - unreasonably and coordinating character killings - organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost in the presidential election in 2016.
>>zsm_Latn<< Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
>>zsm_Latn<< -I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and Democrats, - his advocate.
>>zsm_Latn<< The party expressed objections if she would try to charge if she was approved, and if Democrats gained more votes at the House of People's Representatives.
- I'll say like this -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI, then he doesn't fit not just to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he's now, - said Pelosi.
>>zsm_Latn<< Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court..
>>zsm_Latn<< The Pelosi added that he as a Democrat he was worried about the potential ruling of Kavanaugh against the Health Service Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as a conservative understanding of justice.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the hearing of the appointment of office, Kavanaugh avoids the question of whether he will overthrow certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
- It's not time for someone who is hysterical and biased to go up to court and expect us to say, ‘isn't that great,' - the pilot's tail.
And a woman needs to handle it.
>>zsm_Latn<< It was an ethical spark, anger for months and years, and he could not remove it without crying.
- We cried when we were angry, Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
- It's not strange to me, how do you think?
>>zsm_Latn<< He continues, -I am greatly helped by a woman who is an executive somewhere, who says that she also weeps when she is angry, but develops a technique that means that she is angry and begins to cry, she will say to the person who is talking to her, \"You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm getting mad.
And then he keeps going.
And I think it's brilliant--
>>zsm_Latn<< The tears are issued as the way out of anger is partly because he is essentially misunderstood.
>>zsm_Latn<< One of my most powerful memories of early work, in the man-dominated office, a time when I cried with an unspoken rage, was my neck crushed by an older woman - a cold manager who was always a little afraid - who dragged me to the stairs.
- Never let them see you crying, he tells me.
- They don't know you're angry.
>>zsm_Latn<< They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they're making it.
>>zsm_Latn<< Patricia Schroeder, who was a congressional member of Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
>>zsm_Latn<< In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair outside the marriage over a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Miss Schroeder, very frustrated, understood that there was no reason for himself not to charge himself as president.
- That's not a mature decision to think about, he said to me, laughing 30 years later.
- There have been seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
>>zsm_Latn<< Someone called it - the Snow and the Seven Kurcaci »
>>zsm_Latn<< Since it was too late in the campaign, he was left behind in the fundraising, and so he swore he would not follow the election unless he managed to raise 2 million dollars.
>>zsm_Latn<< It was a fight that led to defeat.
>>zsm_Latn<< He found that some of his supporters gave $10,000 to men only gave him $250.
- They think I got a discount. - He's wondering.
>>zsm_Latn<< When he protested that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was too dominated by emotions - gratitude to those who supported him, frustrated with a system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism - making it difficult to talk.
- You might think I'm too nervous, - remember Miss Schroeder about how the press reacted to him.
- You'll think that Kleenex is my sponsor company.
I remember, think, what are they gonna write in my tomb?

>>zsm_Latn<< How U.S.-Tiokok trade competition may be good for Beijing
>>zsm_Latn<< The open fire of trade competition between the U.S. and China was so intense, and as the fight was still far away from the word obsolete, the competition between the two countries might have been favorable to Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
>>zsm_Latn<< Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning early this year by imposing taxes on China's key export items including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
>>zsm_Latn<< A very significant increase was imposed starting this week with a new rate of affecting $200 billion dollars (€150 billion), effectively imposed taxes on half of the entire goods entering the U.S. through China.
>>zsm_Latn<< Beijing has retaliated every time, it has recently imposed a fare of five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
>>zsm_Latn<< China has pleaded to resemble the United States one-per-one, and the second largest economy in the world will not change in the near future.
>>zsm_Latn<< Telling Washington to retreat meant following the will, but publicly giving up to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
>>zsm_Latn<< Still, experts say if Beijing can play his cards appropriately, U.S. competitive pressures can positively support China in the long run by reducing dependence between the two economies.
>>zsm_Latn<< The fact that fast political decisions by Washington or Beijing can make conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries is actually more dangerous than those who have previously observed, ← Following Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
>>zsm_Latn<< Syria 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
>>zsm_Latn<< Syria said that they were ready for the return of voluntary refugees and offered help to rebuild a country destroyed by over seven years of war.
>>zsm_Latn<< Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country improved.
>>zsm_Latn<< This day the situation in the field is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in combating terrorism, she says.
>>zsm_Latn<< The government goes on to rehabilitate the damaged areas of terrorists to restore it like it again.
>>zsm_Latn<< All conditions are now present due to the return of refugees voluntarily to the country they have to leave because of the profound terrorism and economic decisions that make their daily lives and their livelihoods a target.
>>zsm_Latn<< The UN estimates over 5.5 million Syrian citizens have evacuated their country since the war began in 2011.
>>zsm_Latn<< The other six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian help.
>>zsm_Latn<< Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild a destroyed country.
>>zsm_Latn<< But he emphasized that they would not receive the help or conditional assistance of countries that support the rebellion.

>>zsm_Latn<< The European team had won the Ryder Cup defeated the U.S. Team with a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
>>zsm_Latn<< The U.S. has lost six consecutive times in European land and has never won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
>>zsm_Latn<< Europe regained its trophy when the Danish captain team Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
>>zsm_Latn<< US star Phil Mickelson, who attempted almost throughout the tournament, hit his tee punch into the water on par-3 the 16th hole, recognizing his defeat against Francesco Molinari.
>>zsm_Latn<< Italian golf athlete Molinari shines along his round, to 1 of 4 players who ever got 5-0-0 since the format that applies in the tournament began in 1979.
>>zsm_Latn<< American Atlet Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest sequence players in the European team, Thorbjorn Oleen of Denmark.
>>zsm_Latn<< World top sequence player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 over Ian Poulter from England who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
>>zsm_Latn<< A veteran of the eight Ryder Cup, Sergio Garcia of Spain became a European with a complete victory with a 255 career point on this tournament.
- I don't usually cry, but I can't hold it today.
This is a hard year.
>>zsm_Latn<< Thank you very much for Thomas to choose me and trust me.
>>zsm_Latn<< I'm very happy, very glad to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help, - said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
>>zsm_Latn<< He gave his responsibility to his fellow stateman John Ram who defeated U.S. legendary golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
- The amazing pride I feel, beat the Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him, - the 23-year-old Rahm.
>>zsm_Latn<< Woods lost in his four games in France and now has a record 13-21-3 of Ryder Cup career recording.
>>zsm_Latn<< The odd statistics by one of the best players all the time, have won 14 main tickets just under Jack Nicklaus.
>>zsm_Latn<< The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to get a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
>>zsm_Latn<< US captain Jim Furyk spoke after the performance disappointed his team, \"I'm proud of these people, they fight.
It's been this morning when we're making Europe difficult.
We quarreled.
Thanks to Thomas.
It's a great captain.
>>zsm_Latn<< All 12 players play very well.
We're going to rearrange, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll step forward.
I love these 12 people and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to honor.
We're losing the best.
