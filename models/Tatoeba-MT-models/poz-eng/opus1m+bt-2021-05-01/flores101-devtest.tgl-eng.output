This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator using the juice of the red cabbage.
The cabbage juice varies in color according to how acidic or chemical (alcalano) is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ion (the H in pH) in the measured chemical.
Hydrogen atoms consist only of a proton independent of its lecton, and separate hydrogen ions are usually called protons.

Following them there are many more cats that fit the size of an animal that has been caught in the balance from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including missing cats) eat more small victims like insects, rats, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is having due work or a special task to prevent each cat's competition.
Lions are the most friendly cats, living in large groups called primes.
Prides are made up of one to three related old men, including up to three female and young lions.
Women often have close relationships with each other, as a large family of sisters and daughters.

They can see clearly in the dark by looking at the night, and also act secretly. Ocelots catch their prey by adapting to their environment and then grab their prey.
If a small group of living things (a small population) are isolated from the main population they come from (like if they go to a mountain or a river, or if they move to a new island so they can't easily return), they often find themselves in a place different than they came from.
This new environment has other resources and other competitors, so the new population will need other characteristics or fittings to be a strong competitor than they had previously needed.
Nothing changed the original population, they still needed the same suit as before.
As time passes, as the new population begins to fit into their new environment, their appearance begins to lengthen rather than another population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions-million years, the two populations will look different in appearance that they are not classified as the same species.
We call this process species, which only means the formation of new species.The species is an inevitable product and an important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take up the carbon-dioxide produced by humans (that is, breathing out).
Plants form their food from the sun using photosynthesis, and they offer shade.
We build our homes from plants and dress up from plants, and almost all the food we eat is plants, if there are no plants, the animals will not survive.

The country of Japan holds about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island around the world!
Because of the group of islands of Japan, Japan is often referred to as α-tenths α is due to its geographical location.
Taiwan's origin dates back to the 15th century in which European navigators were listed the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company set up a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated the transformation of the practices of native grain production and gave Chinese workers work on its rice plantations and sugar.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coast area of Taiwan and declared Taiwan the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after losing the First Battle of China and Japan (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it surrendered Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Pichu consists of three main structures, Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Binata.

For example, the most common global photography format for fixed subjects is 35 mm, which has become the main area of the film at the end of the time of the film analog.
This is still being done today, but more importantly it is that the camera's camera's camera's camera's camera sensor formats have inherited its asspect ratio.
The 35 mm format is in fact, somewhat confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
The asspect ratio of this format (i-divide in twelve to get the simplest who-number ratio) straight is 3:2.
Many common formats (family APS of formats, for example) are more or equal to this aspect ratio.
The highly-expanded and often-disputed rule of a third is a simple guide that creates enthusiasm as it maintains the level of order in an image.
This promises that the often effective site for the main subject is located in the location of lines dividing the image by three vertical and horizontal (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, underwent investigation.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states in spite of differences in language and custom.
Its spreading-all power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the basic principles of the Christian must use wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty and church funds are there for that particular purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being met.
Soon after the outbreak of conflicts, Britain started a naval block against Germany.
The strategy has been proven to be effective, cutting down important supplies for military and civilian, although this vacancies have violated the generally accepted international law arranged as a system through several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain built the intercontinental waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire part of the ocean, causing even neutral ships to be at risk.

Ancient China had a unique way of showing different times; each period of China or every family with power was a certain dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was the period of disintegration of the divided provinces, the most well known of which was the period of the Three Kingdoms that took place for 60 years between Han and the Jin Dynasty.

Muhammad took a keen interest in things more than this fleshly life.He often went to the cave known as αHira α (light) on the Mount of α (light) for his reflection.
the very cave, which survived in times, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritistic leanings.
Found at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely separate from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not so easy to find out, even if someone knows that it did exist, when it was in the cave, it was actually a separation.
The clear, beautiful skies and many surrounding mountains can be seen or heard within the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.

Determinism technological is a designation that embraces a wide range of the kinds of ideas practiced, from the push of technology or the intense technological need to the precise understanding that human destiny is driven by an underworld logic associated with scientific laws and their revelation in technology.
Most definitions of technological determinism share two common concepts: that the very development of technology follows a stand above cultural or political power, and that technology has α-effects α in societies that are natural, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it may be said that the car is the one that accounts for building roads.
But, the national network of roads would not be a profitable business if only for a few vehicles, so new production methods were made up to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The possession of many cars causes a higher case of road accidents, which go to the invention of new health care techniques for editing damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a large element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individuals, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography flourished, and they, being in accordance with the place of society, were better than the unconstitutional enacted laws.
In such a way that Paris was known as the capital of the contemporary world’s fashion, Constantinople was regarded as the capital of European pyuda.
Its recognition as a center of luxury began in 400 A.D. and graduated to 1100 A.D.
Its state came down during the 12th century because of the fact that Christian conquerors or Crusaders returned with gifts like silks and spices more valued than what the Byzantine market could give.
This was the time when the title of the Mode Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was at the height of the era between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
Nevertheless, thanks to recent communications channels, western fashions can be left for 25 to 30 years.
in the late Middle Ages western Europe began to develop their own style.One of the greatest advances at the time as a result of the crusades people began to use buttons to close the clothes.
Cross-life agriculture is an agricultural practice in order to raise enough food to meet only the needs of the agriculturist and his family.
Cross-life agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses diluted seed naturally in eco-rehiion along with crop exchange or other so-called simple techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers participated in cross-life agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bind people with similar thoughts that they feel neglected according to social norms and allow them to form a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique due to the age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that refer to a sub-culture as unique can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often suggest their membership by the unique and figurative use of style, which includes fashions, customs, and verbal.
One of the most common methods used to show the importance of socialization is to base a few unpleasant situations of children who have not been taught good manners by the aged as they grow up by neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse.
These children are called αligay - or wild. Some wild children have been previously confined by people (usually their own parents); in other cases this child-adjustment is due to the parents' rejection of a child's serious intelligible or physical disability.
Children who have limited contact with people since their young age may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have settled in the forest by themselves.
When fully raised by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (according to physical limitations) that are almost like those shown by the animal who cares, such as its fear or cold treatment of humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and interesting, scheduling support does more than this.
Giving features for learning or grading (scaffolding) is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support for indibidwals who pass through a new learning experience using a new computer program for example or starting a new project.
Parts (scaffolds) can both appear to be virtual (virtual) and true.that is, a teacher is a saffold form as well as Microsoft Office Clippy.
The virtual support frameworks are embedded in the software and are inclined to ask questions, hint, and entertain techniques that may have become difficult for the student to face alone.
Children are placed in the Assembly House for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is uncaring, caring, and educational, but they are there.
We considered the Assembly Houses a safe place for these children.
Our orphanage system should provide safe homes, loving guardians, sustainable education, and reliable health care.
The house-keeping must provide all the needs that weren't in the previous home they were taken from.
The Internet has monopolized the element of leisure communication enjoyment and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the Internet are becoming the way for additional forms regarding the use and graphifications approach.
For example, α-learning αα and ααα are recommended as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
← Personal involvement » and ← ongoing relationships are also referred to as new aspects of Eighmey's and McCord's motivations (1998) when they investigated the reactions of listeners to websites.
The use of film recording has caused significant findings in defining very small expressions, facial movements that only occur within a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that man can determine whether a person lies by properly interpreting its small expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his role The Speaker of the President, has been suggested how people who cannot appreciate speech due to brain injury can even be able to evaluate honesty correctly.
He further suggested that such abilities in the definition of human behavior may be the same as animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic diversity: secret and open.
Mutation is able to add new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the collection of variables used.
The separation and recombination combine the fusion back and forth between two pools per generation.
In the sabana, it is difficult for a spring with a digestive system that is as good as humans to meet its requirement of amino-acids from plant manufacturers.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: slow growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest resources that can be obtained from the plant are the proteins that are in the leaves and bones-gugary, but it is difficult for primaries like us to digest them unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods ( ants, termites, eggs) are not only susceptible to digestion, rather they provide an abundance of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
Recommended everything, we should not be surprised if our ancestors have managed to solve their - protein problem - in a somewhat similar way that the monkeys do in the savanna today.
Sleep distraction is the process of deliberately waking up while in your usual sleep time and resleep after a little time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to restore your consciousness without waking you up at all.
If you find yourself changing the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of your room, to force you to rise from your bed to kill it.
Other choices based on biological rhythm require drinking a lot of water (particular water or tea, a well-known sanitizer) before going to sleep, which moves one to stand for tears.
The amount of inner peace a person has is associated with the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force that exists.Every person has the potential to find complete peace and security.
Each can reach enlightenment.The only thing that prevents this purpose is our own stress and negativeness.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist lessons, but extended by the path of machiana affection and the vast array of techniques derived from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is so simple that it is made up of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of all lovers.
In Kundalini Yoga the energy of Kundalini (power of play) is stimulated in the way of yoga positions, breathing exercise, mantra and biswalization.
The centre of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of Gods.By describing the mind of various gods, energy channels are purified, chakras become active and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany became the object of all during World War 2, which caused cooperation between the USSR and the USA.At the end of the war the conflicts in the system, process and culture became a factor in the disintegration of nations.
Within two years of the end of the war, the former allies had become rivals and the Cold War had begun.
It will last until the next 40 years and will be truly fought by the representative forces (proxy forces) in the battle areas from Africa to Asya, in Afghanistan, Cuba and other areas.
On September 17, 1939, Polish defence was destroyed, and the only hope was to retreat and revitalize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But, these plans had become obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded and formed Belarusian and Ukrainian areas after the eastern regions of Poland were attacked in violation of the Treaty of Peace in Riga, the Soviet-Polecular Treaty of Independence, and other international, bilateral or multilateral agreements.
The use of ships for delivery of products is the best way for everyone to move large numbers of people and products across the oceans.
The work of the fleets according to tradition is to ensure that your country can maintain its ability to comfort people and products, while at the same time, preventing your opponent's ability to comfort people and their products.
One of the latest examples of this paradox is the Northern Atlantic campaign of WWII (World War II). Americans then tried to cross men and tools in the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German naval forces, the main ones used as U-boats, were then tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had happened to fail, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it had done in most Europe.
It seems that the goats were first tamed about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began caring for them for the ease of milk, fur, meat, and skin.
Goats are often placed in herds that roam the mountains or other pastures, often cared for by shepherds who are often young or young, similar to the more prominent shepherds.The method of caring for the flock is still used today.
Car lanes have been built in England as early as the 16th Century.
Even though carts are made up of parallel wooden boards, they allow horses to pull them faster and pull larger loads than relatively rough roads.
Trabyes were used early to keep the tracks fixed. However, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be better if they had a narrow piece of steel above.
This practice became widespread, but steel caused more interaction with the wooden wheels of carriages.
For one thing, the wheels were replaced with steel wheels, and in 1767 the first entire steel track was introduced.
The first known transport was walking where people began walking vertically two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning standing person).
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk straight as they were used to.
Bipedal specializations can be found in the fossils of Australopithecus that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may be able to walk using two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can begin to live more uncontaminated in our environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists in order to reduce future suffering at least.
It is similar with treatment of symptoms in many cases, but if we do not want a temporary solution, then we should look for the root cause of the problems and we should stop making them work.
The world’s scientific and technological advances have changed much enough, and the problems have become more severe as a result of man’s overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyle of the people.
After Congress ratified it on July 4, a hand-written laboror signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson were sent to John Dunlap's printing press several blocks away.
All night there was between 150 and 200 copies made, which is now known as the - Dunlap's posters -
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon at the grounds of the Freedom Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he read to his soldiers in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides known to still exist are the oldest surviving copy of the document.The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survive and live today.
Many people do not believe that they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and flights.
But there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk using their two back legs like T-Rex.
Almost all currently used computers are based on data control coded by binary numbers.
The binary number can only have one of two values, hal. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, when the computer term is used.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting are generally sufficient if the master test is wanted cannot be performed.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open drug container or toxic chemicals at home.
Check the label for specific instructions for the main solution for that specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of these insects.
This term is derived from the ancient knowledge of the Harots, which are insects that are ideally suited for breeding humans.
Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs both depend for a long time on those who give birth after they are born, fit to live in the nest or pack of their host.
Throughout the United States of America, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), considering it as a major neurological disorder in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Research found that women are twice as likely to have MS than men.
A couple may take this for granted that it is not good for them or for their child's sake, to raise a baby.
The couple may choose to adopt their baby.
In an adoption, real parents have terminated their rights as parents so that other couples can raise the child.
The most distant of agham is to find out how the world works by scientific means.This method in fact guides most scientific research.
It is not independently, experimenting, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, are accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found it to be far away from its origins of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the observed rhythms in body structure and behavior are totally dependent on what happens within their bodies and their production by biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responsive to external signals, are documented in most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are oscillators that promote self to continue the time of free-tearned stabilization even without external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment is one of the leading suggestions that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or blues to place their own DNA in a bacterium.
They performed two experiments marking either DNA in phage using radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects based on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material being affected and if the cells affected are cells for sexual reproduction.
Only mutations in germ array cells can pass on to children, while mutations anywhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature - based tourism attracts people interested in visiting places in nature for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including forest plants and animals.
Examples of activity works include hunting, fishing, photographing, bird observation, and visiting parks and learning environmental information.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the organs in Borneo.
Each day, people leave small towns of the country with cars to go to their workplaces and pass on to others whose workplace is where they come from.
In dynamic flow-and-coming of this transportation all people are somehow connected to, and support, to a transport system based on private vehicles.
Today's agham suggests that this vast coal economy has removed the ecosystem (biosphere) from one of its strong states that have supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone enters the community and uses the transportation system. Virtually everyone cries about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do transportation systems get these complaints, why do they waste daily? Do transport engineers really lack the ability? Or do other more important things happen?
The Traffic Wave is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, an analysis of traffic flow is not easy because the behavior of the driver cannot be calculated when there is a centenarian-pornity security.
Fortunately, drivers tend to dwell within unrenewable scope; hence, traffic flows are also stable and can be patented using mathematics.
To better describe traffic flow, relationships have been created between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) weight, and (3) speed.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design development, and management of road facilities.
Insects were the first birds to fly, and their ability to fly enabled them to capture their opponents more easily and find food and husbands more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of having the ability to fold their wings along with the body.
It gives them a wider range of small hiding places from predators.
Now, the only insects that cannot close their wings are dragons and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man called Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
Several people believed he was right but many people believed in the opposite; that the Solar System revolved around Mundo, along with the Sun (and even other stars).
This seems to be meaningful, since it is not understandable that the Mundo seems to be moving, is it not?
The Amazon River is the second - longest and largest river in Mundo, bringing water more than 8 times as many as the second largest river.
Amazon is also the largest river in Mundo, sometimes six miles wide.
The entire 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers on the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of the pyramid with stone did not stop until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never overcome by their size and the technical coming from their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, who were then over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City population is about 800, the world’s smallest free nation and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its law and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working in the state as Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City were Roman Catholics.
People already know about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, all of which can be found in nature in the form of native and easily mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, assumed that everything consisted of a mixture of one or more of four elements. They were the earth, water, wind, and fire.
This is more similar to the four state of matter (in this same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though he also assumes that they become new things to form what we see.
Alloys are common mixtures of two or more metals.Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table and some of them are also metals (such as calcium and potassium) and can be mixed with other metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys with small amounts of non-metatical elements such as carbon.
Everything in space is made up of matter.All objects are made up of small objects called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly complex of small trillion-triion in them can fit the dot at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods were inserted, the pencil was placed in lower status and uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, which will never need to get close to the fantasy.
A person will only know what can happen on the keyboard when something newer has arrived.
The fission pump works on the principle that energy needs to combine the nucleus with multiple protons and neutrons.
Perhaps it is like rolling a heavy cart up the hill, so dividing the nucleus can release some of that energy.
Some atoms are those with an imbalance of the number of protons and neutrons meaning they have the possibility of losing when there is little or no sharp number of protons and neutrons.
The Moon's surface is made of rocks and dust.The outer layer of the Moon is called crust.
The skin part (crust) is about 70 km thick in the near part and is 100 km thick in the far part.
It is thinner under the maria and denser under high ground.
There may be more maria in the part seen in the world because the earth's crust is thinner.It is easier for lava to climb to the surface.
Content theories center on finding what can motivate people or attract their attention.
These theories suggest that people have some particular needs and/or desires they embrace as they grow older.
These theories are focused on what drives some people to want their actions and what things in their environment push them to do or so don't do things.
Two well-known theories of content are the Theory of Herarchy of Maslow's Needs and the Theory of Hertzberg's Two Factors.
In general, two behaviors can emerge as rulers begin to dominate their former peers. One end of the spectrum is the test of staying-one in male partners » (or females).
This kind of ruler is hard to make decisions that many would not like, discipline, assessment, delegate, and test people.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes undetectable individual who feels he should change everything the group already does and make it his or her.
After all, the chief was really responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This trait often results in a misunderstanding between leaders and other colleagues in the team.
Virtual teams are also followed by the same values of virtue that are the same as the common groups, but there are non-specific differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of the common team because their teams can meet according to different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The presence of a real-not-seen team » (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique part of the virtual team.
The \"invisible team\" is the management team in which each member is reporting.The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the exhaustive process of the development of the learning organization? A purpose for actively implementing the concepts of learning an organization is inobility.
If all resources are used effectively throughout an organization's active department, creativity and intelligence can be expressed.
As a result, the process of teamwork of the organization to overcome a barrier can lead to a new inattentional process to serve the customer's needs.
Before there can be an organization of modern ideas, leadership should create the culture of inaction as well as shared knowledge and learning as an organization.
Angel (2006), explaining Continuum as a means used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiotic data provides physical evidence for the theoretical method of investigating the learning capacity.It therefore limits the area of research and makes it more precise.
Scientists in their research promote the connection between brain pathology and behavior.
It has been known for a very long time that various types of brain damage, painful experiences, wounds, and unique boils affect behavior and alters some mental function.
The increase in new technology has allowed us to see and examine brain structures and processes that have not been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to form model simulations that help us understand processes in our mind.
While AI has a strong definition of fiction-agham, AI forms a very important branch of computer agham, which is about the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
Al research includes developing machines that will automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
AI functions include control, planning and timing, the ability to answer customer tests and questions, and also the recognition of human handwriting, voice and face.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real - life problems.
The Al system is now often used in the field of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as has been done in software applications for many home computers and bid games.
The field trip is a large part of each classroom.The teacher often wants to speed up his or her students in areas where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with educational tours, students may look at museum artifacts, visit the aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
Sharing educational travel in a virtual way is also an excellent way to accommodate a trip and share experiences with the recruiting classes.
For example, every year Bennet School students in North Carolina design a website about their journey to the State Capital, each year re-evaluating the website's development, but old versions are retained online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Although learners often start their blog writing experience with poor grammar and spelling, it is usually changed by having readers.
Because learners are often the most critical of viewers, the writer of the blog began to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Swimmming - forces the student to be more intelligent about the world around them - The need to give the public interest opens the students up to be clever and interested (Toto, 2004).
Writing a blog is a way that encourages collaboration, and encourages learners to continue learning beyond the traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs -ay can enable learners to be more categorical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, learners can refer to their positions in the context of what others have written but also outline their own views on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's capital of mixed, two language use and features many galleries and art museums that show the past and now Canada.
Far south is the Niagara Falls and the north is home to Muskoka’s unused natural beauty and beyond.
All these things and many others feature in Ontario as what outsiders can consider Canadian.
The vast northern areas are relatively populated and others are almost deserted.
For a population comparison that is reporting to many: more African Americans live in the United States than Canadian citizens.
East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean on the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and can be considered a continent when talking about the wildlife.
Most smaller islands are free countries, or related to France, and are known as elaborate Beach resorts.
The Arabs also took Islam to the lands, and it became very important to Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
Sahel is bordered by the region to the north, and to the south and west is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any women traveling on a trip say that they are married, regardless of their true matrimony status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but it doesn't look too expensive.)
Women should be able to realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment and it is common to be followed, touched by the arm, etc.
Be strong in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to stand (there are cultural differences or not, it is still unacceptable!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, just to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Morocco sult rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and gave it the name Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trade bases there.
Casablanca is one of the places throughout Morocco that is not interesting to go to for shopping.
Surrounding the old Medina can easily see areas that sell traditional Morocco uses, such as plantains, clayware, use made of animal skin, houkah, and all kinds of loroloy, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is the city of tourism of the Democratic Republic of Congo at its earliest near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by the lahar from Nyiragongo volcano covering most of the public roads, particularly in the center of town.
While Goma is quite safe, any visits outside of Goma must be researched to understand the situation of the conflict that continues in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest monitoring of the African Mountain Gorillas.
You can ride on the boda-boda (motoric taxi) to turn to Goma. The common (local) coin is ~500 Congoldese Francs for short riding.
Along with being difficult to reach it, the -Timbuktu - is now used as a metaphor for exotics and distant lands.
At present, Timbuktu is a poverty - stricken village, although its reputation accounts for its popular tourist destination, and it has a airport.
In 1990, it was placed on a list of endangered global heritage trees, thanks to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main hosts of Henry Louis Gates in his PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city is different from all other cities in the country, because it has more Arabic style than Africans.
The National Park of Kruger (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the crocodile River.
The park occupies 19,500 km&2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different lives.
This is one of South Africa's major attic and it is considered to be proud of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Also like all South Africa's National Park, there is a fee for daily conservation and entry into the park.
It can also be useful for a person to buy a Forest Card, which will allow access to either the choice parks in South Africa or all South Africa's National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and the area that many tourists recognize as the main source.
The parade of buildings that make up the landscape of Hong Kong’s towering building is likened to a shining bar chart seen by the presence of the Victoria City waters.
To see Hong Kong's most beautiful sights, leave the island and go to the opposite bank of Kowloon.
Much of the prosperity of Hong Kong’s island cities lies in the thick part of the restored land on the north coast.
This is the place that British conquerors claimed to be theirs and so if you are looking for a pruwe of colonial past territory, in this place it is well started.
The Sundarbans are the largest reefs along the coast around the world, reaching 80 km (50 mi) to enter the coastal provinces of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans are declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, part of the forest in India’s territory called the National Park of Sundarbans.
Forests, however, are not just swamps of the â € caverns — among them some of the last remaining hopes of the powerful forests once covered the Ganga plain.
The Sundarbans cover 3,850 km&2, with one-third immersed in the water/land areas.
Since 1966 Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are 409 Royal Bengal tigers now and about 30,000 spot-sized deer in place.
The buses leave the inter-distributed bus station (in spite of the river) all day long, even most, especially your east and Jakarta/Bumthang exit between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-distribution buses are often full, it would be wise to buy a ticket that is a few days ahead of time.
Most districts are served by Japan’s small Coaster Bus, which is comfortable and durable.
Taxi partitions are a quick and comfortable way to travel to close places, such as Paro (NU 150) and Pukha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a bridge supported by cables.It covers the Oyapock River in order to connect the cities of Onapoque with Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock with French Guiana.
The two towers reach 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and there are two lanes of 3.50 m wide.
The height of the space under the bridge was 15 meters. Done in August 2011, it did not open traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully used in September 2017, when the construction of the research bases of Brazilian customs will be completed.
GuaranÃ is the most important indigenous group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as relatively hunter-gatherers who also practiced agriculture for their survival.
The Chaco region became home to other indigenous ethnic groups such as Gukucurura and Panayua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, which was once known as the \"The Giant Province of the Indies,\" was born as a result of the conflict between Spanish conquerors and groups of the native taals.
The Spaniards began a period of conquest that lasted three centuries.
Since the establishment of AsunciÃ3n in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain its many native features and identities.
Arhentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polar players around the world.
The most important tournament of the year occurs in December in the ten-fold field in Las CÃÉcutitas.
Smaller competitions and fights can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where tickets for polar matchs will be purchased, check out Asocacion Argentina de Polo.
The official money of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) with the value equal to a British pound (GBP).
Money can be replaced by the only banks on the islands found in Stanley in front of the Western FIC store.
Briton pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands and Stanley credit cards and are also frequently accepted for US dollars.
In remote islands credit cards may not be received, even though British and United States currency can be obtained; the early check on the owners to know what is a good way to pay.
It was almost impossible to replace the money of the Falklands on the outside of the islands, so to exchange money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is in the south of the Ekwador, it's summer in the winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice pores.
Montevideo is in subtropical; in the summer months, temperatures above +30¢C are common.
The winter may have a subtle cold: temperatures rarely dropped than ice, but air and humidity combined to make it feel lighter than what the thermometer said.
There is no particular αtag-tungun α and αtagnut ααος times: the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park animals are used to see people, the animals are yet fierce and should not be fed or distracted.
The park rulers say, move not down 100 yards/meters on bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters on all other wild animals!
No matter how friendly they are, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all big animals can attack.
Each year, many visitors fail to maintain proper distance — these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous — so that they are given their space.
In addition, it should be known that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smellful foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, the town is on the island of Amalu and has a population of only a little less than 40,000.
Abijah was founded in the 1850 ’ s and became the official capital of Samoa beginning 1959.
The port was the site of the famous stop of naval fighting in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships sank, except a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans were killed.
During the war for freedom organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the town resulted in the execution of the most important chief Rausa Tamasse Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is between two ports.The points are in three places.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are in the Pacific Ocean and their length ranges from Long Bay to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these are sand beaches where they safely descend into the water, most of them with shade given by pohutukawa trees.
The shores of the Tamaki Drive are located in the Waitemata Court, in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
They are once busy beaches where families go and have a beautiful array of shops found on the shore.
The main local beer is 'Numero Uno', it's not a complex beer, if it's unpleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called \"Manta\"
Many French wines can be purchased, but New Zealand and Australia's wines can be more stable on the trip.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it's easy to find water in the bottle if you're afraid.
For the Australians, the idea of 'white flat' coffee is foreign. Black's brown is 'espresso', cappuccino is accompanied by a high crema pile (not bubble), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is according to the Belgian standard.Writful drinks made from fruit juice are expensive but very delicious.
Many searockings (reef) occur throughout the year, and damages caused by any reason with regard to the reef are relatively rare.
Nevertheless, follow the counsel of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
The diacrican comes out near the shores and near the river craters from October to April in the north of 1770. They will occasionally be seen outside these times.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of man and will swim away.
The crocodiles in saltwater do not actively inhabit the ocean, their main habitat is in the river estuaries that are north from Rockhampton.
