Hershey and Chase used viruses to produce more bacteria in their DNA.
They performed two experiments that marked the DNA of a virus with a radioactive phosphorus or a viral protein containing radioactive sulfur.
Mutation or variation has different effects depending on the type of diversity, the importance of the object inherited and whether the cells affected are germ-line cells.
Only the differences in germ-line cells are attributed to children, but differences from others can cause cell death or cancer.

Traffic flow is a study of drivers ’ movements and vehicles between two and each other’s interactions.
But the study of traffic flow is difficult because it is unrealistic to expect a hundred percent of drivers' behavior.
Fortunately, today drivers act prudently.For this reason, traffic can be the same and can only be seen mathematically.
To understand traffic flow, the relationship between these three is established,(1)flow,(2)ence(3)velocity.
These relationships contribute to the planning, design, and operation of the road facility.
