>>zsm_Latn<< The wax needle floats on the surface of the water is caused by surface voltage.

The modern ice skate blade has two curved edges between them.
Because the lower part of the knife is slightly curved, when the blade is turned toward the other side, the tip is also attached to the ice.

>>zsm_Latn<< In order to return to previous energy levels, they need to remove the excess of energy they gain from the light.
>>zsm_Latn<< They do this by removing a small light-fouted small-lighted dispersals that are 3:12 -
>>zsm_Latn<< Scientists call this process - the release of the radiation that is stimulated - because the atoms are stimulated by light, causing the release of light photons, and light is a kind of beam.
The next picture shows an atom that emits photons, and the reality of the photon turns out to be much smaller than the one shown in the picture.
>>zsm_Latn<< Photons are smaller than elements that make up atoms!
