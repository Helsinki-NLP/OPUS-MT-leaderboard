>>zsm_Latn<< The Majlis (AM) Wales worried 'seen like a puppet'
>>zsm_Latn<< There was an interest among some AMs on their title proposals should be changed to MWP (The Wales Parliament Member).
It arose because of plans to change the name of the trial to the Wales Parliament.
AM the entire political spectrum is concerned that it can invite a surprise.
An AM from the Labor Party said, his party was taking the weight of ‘he was five with ‘Twp' and ‘Pwp'.'
>>zsm_Latn<< For readers outside Wales: In Wales, ‘twp' means ‘gold' and ‘pwp' means ‘finish.'
>>zsm_Latn<< AM of the Plaid said, his overall party was 'not happy' and had proposed an alternative.
>>zsm_Latn<< A Welsh Conservative said his ‘open-minded' party about the name change, but stated he was a short verbal jump from MWP to Boneka.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this context, the letter ‘w' in Wales is called the same as the English name of Yorkshire for the letter ‘u.'
>>zsm_Latn<< The court of the Majlis, who was setting up a law to introduce a change of name, said, \"The solemn decree concerning any person who is called the Majlis must be a matter of the scholars' own-
>>zsm_Latn<< The Act of the Government of Wales 2017 empowered the Wales council to change its name.
>>zsm_Latn<< In June, Suruhjaya announced the results of public opinion of the proposals that received extensive support to call the assembly as the Wales Parliament.
>>zsm_Latn<< In terms of the AM title, Surbukanjaya favors the Wales Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option receives the most support in public competition.
AM seems to suggest alternative options, but it's problematic to achieve a word of agreement and can settle the head of Honoring Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft of law regarding change within a few weeks.
>>zsm_Latn<< The law on the inclusion of other changes in the way the ceremony works, including regulations regarding the loss of AM credentials and the design of the committee system.
>>zsm_Latn<< AM will get the last vote on what questions should be addressed when they discuss the law.
>>zsm_Latn<< Macedonia made a vote in referendum on changing the country's name
>>zsm_Latn<< The voter will vote on Sunday whether to rename their country to the ‘North Macedonian Republic.'
>>zsm_Latn<< The popular union was formed in an attempt to resolve disputes for decades with the neighboring country of Greece, which had its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens had long asserted that the name of his northern neighbor's country represents the demands on his territory and has repeatedly denied his membership's offer for the EU and NATO.
>>zsm_Latn<< Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vocal challenger for the change of the name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, advocates of referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that a change in name was only a price to pay to join the EU and NATO union.
>>zsm_Latn<< St. Martin's Bell is quiet because the churches are fighting in Harlem
- The old man I met said, as history shows, there are bars and churches on every side of the street, says Mr. Adams.
- Today, both of them are gone--
He said he was missing a bar that could be understood.
- People are social in a different way today, she says.
-Bar is no longer a living room in a neighborhood where people will always go--
>>zsm_Latn<< To the church, he was worried about money from the sale of assets would not last long as the leaders expected it, and they would soon return where they started.
The churches, he said, could be replaced with the apartment buildings and condominium inhabited by those who do not want to help keep the shrines still in this neighborhood.
>>zsm_Latn<< -Majority of the person who will buy the condominium in this building is white, he said--and thus will make these churches closed at all as it is unlikely that most people who enter this condominium will be members of the churches--
>>zsm_Latn<< Both churches were built by the white class before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
>>zsm_Latn<< Methodist's original council moved in the 1930s.
>>zsm_Latn<< The nearby black congregation had taken possession of the building's property.
>>zsm_Latn<< St. Martin had been taken over by the black class under the Honored John Howard Johnson, who led the merchant boikot at 125th Street, a main way to buy in Harlem, who opposed the acquisition or promote black classes in work.
The fire in 1939 destroyed that building, but as Father of the Pastor, Johnson, made plans to rebuild it, they ordered tower bells.
>>zsm_Latn<< David Johnson, the son and successor of Paderi Johnson at St. Martin, proudly calls the tower bell a ‘low of the poor people.'
>>zsm_Latn<< The player who played the cart in July called it something else: ‘The cultural heritage' and ‘the historical instrument that should not be replaced.'
>>zsm_Latn<< Father, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that she was the first bell in the world to be played by black musician Dionosio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
>>zsm_Latn<< What has been played in St Martin since a few months ago has become a complexity to architects and contractors, some brought by church leaders, others by the Episcopal bishop.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Vestri - Congregation administration room, composed of public leaders - wrote the bishop in July with the bishop's concern would strive to satisfy the cost - for the vestry space, even though the vestry was not involved in the contractor taking the architect and contractor brought in by the bishop.
Certain members of the congregation there complained about the lack of transparency in the bishop’s office.
An attack on 13-year-olds while diving in search of reefs in California
One gang attacked and wounded 13 - year - old boy on Saturday while he was digging for a shell in California on the day of the opening of the canal season, officials said.
>>zsm_Latn<< The attack occurred before 7 o'clock in the morning near the Beacon Beach in the Enciitas.
>>zsm_Latn<< Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel says at first he thinks he's just a jolt of fun catching a shell, but he's--he's sure that the boy screams, - I got to bite!
I got to bite!
- Hammel says when he finds the boy.
- I cry to everyone to get out of the water: - There's a fight in the water! - Add Hammel.
>>zsm_Latn<< The children were flown to Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical circumstances.
>>zsm_Latn<< The species of sharks responsible for the attack are unknown.
Captain Larry Giles' Rescuer said in the media scheme that the pit had been found in the area a few weeks ago, but it has been confirmed to be a harmless fighter species.
Giles added that he suffered from trauma at the top of his body.
>>zsm_Latn<< The officers closed off the beach access from the Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinity for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
>>zsm_Latn<< Science plan to enter the beauty market in the UK
>>zsm_Latn<< Sainsbury took Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams from the beautystyle room in a worthless building controlled by the expert assistant.
>>zsm_Latn<< As part of the effort to enter the beauty market worth £2.8 billion in the UK, which continues to grow while the fair sales and home equipment return, a greater beauty space will be tested in 11 buildings across the country and brought to more buildings next year if it produces success.
>>zsm_Latn<< Breathing in beauty comes when the market looks for ways to use the once charged shelf space for TV, microwave emissions and household equipment.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sainsbury said he would double the size of the bid of his beauty so that 3,000 products, including figures such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.

The market also resurfaced the various products Boutique so as to promote its products of vegan mesra - something that is increasingly sought by young buyers.
>>zsm_Latn<< Also, the oil trader Fragrance Shop will test concessions in the two Sciencebury highway markets, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, the second week of the opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year's end.
>>zsm_Latn<< Buying online and turning towards buying a little food every day at a local private store means the big market needs to work harder again to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sciencebury, said that the branch would look like a giant building in view of the chain of markets trying to fight Aldi and Lidl's big business with more services and non-food products.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sainsbury put the Argos branch in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several places since he bought both chains two years ago, it is said that it has increased runcit sales and made profit more profitable.
The former market wanted to modify the beauty and pharmaceutical sections that ended with failure.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sainsbury tested the same effort as Boot in early 2000, but the cooperation ended after talking about how to divide the revenues from the pharmaceutical store in his major market.
>>zsm_Latn<< A new strategy emerged after Saisbury sold 281 pharmaceutical stores business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a role in the plan, adding a variety of fancy skin care figures including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four buildings.
>>zsm_Latn<< Paul Mills-Hicks, the manager of the Sciencesbury commercials, said: \"‘We have changed the appearance and appearance in our beauty room to improve the environment for our customers.
>>zsm_Latn<< We also spread out with specially trained friends to be willing to offer advice.
Our diversity is designed to meet every need, and an interesting environment and a convenient location means that we are now an attractive destination of beauty that challenges how to buy the old--

Willoughby had no time for household goods and accessory from the Truly General.
>>zsm_Latn<< The couple's business is likened to Goop's spell by Gwyneth Paltrow.
>>zsm_Latn<< This Morning, 37, used Instagram to announce that she was going to stop.
>>zsm_Latn<< Holly Willoughby had left the Dragons' Den's star, Peter Jones, in a state of anger by withdrawing from the profitable lifestyle-style spell business at the end times - to focus on his unusual new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
>>zsm_Latn<< The source says Jones ‘away' when that successful TV woman admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business embassy headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer - worth up to £1.5 million - meaning she had no time to devote household goods and accessory to the Truly department.

>>zsm_Latn<< When Willoughby, 37, uses Instagram to announce he wants to leave Truly, Jones flies out of Britain towards one of his vacation houses.
Source said: ‘Tonight, Truth has become Holly's priority.
>>zsm_Latn<< It will be his long-term future that can witness him through the coming decades.
>>zsm_Latn<< The decision to pull out everyone involved was really surprising.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it's so close to the launch.
There's a store full of goods at Marlow's headquarters ready for sale.
He believes this Morning, which is among the most acceptable stars in the bank in Britain, can harm millions of firms due to large investment in products consisting of cussies and candles so that clothes and household goods, and potentially to suspend their launch.
And it can be the end to that friendship.
>>zsm_Latn<< Willoughby, Mother of three children and husband of Dan Baldwin had befriended Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
>>zsm_Latn<< Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, accompanied him as chairman in March.

>>zsm_Latn<< Willoughby would be a royal ambassador to M&S and would replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV lawyer in the I'm A Celebrity' program.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sources near Jones said last night - We're not going to review his business-
>>zsm_Latn<< Strong conversation 'and then we fall in love'
He joked about the criticism that the news media will receive for making some comment would consider ‘unreasonable to the president' and very positive about the leader of North Korea.
>>zsm_Latn<< Why did President Trump give up too much?
Trump said by raising the sound of ‘the news reader.'
- I've never given up.
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June had been crowned by Trump as a major step towards the cessation of North Korea's nuclear program.
>>zsm_Latn<< But plans for the cessation of the nuclear program were delayed.
More than three months after the Jun peak assembly in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a similar - similar response to the United States about the early weapons attack movement of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues the partition aimed at maintaining the pressure.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump took a more optimistic view in his meeting speech.
- We're good in contact with North Korea, she says.
- We're going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have a great relationship--
He said that his efforts to repair the relationship with Kim had led to a positive decision — to end the rocket test, to free the ransom, and to take the former American military bodies home.
>>zsm_Latn<< And he maintained his extraordinary approach in talking about relationships with Kim.
- It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this solid arena, we'll have about 200 people standing there,-- said Trump, pointing the crowd directly in front of him.
>>zsm_Latn<< Indonesia Tsunamis and Earthquakes Destroying Islands, Killing Disasters
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, the organization was told that they would not need a foreign government.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population have been displaced, no national disaster has been announced, as a condition for international assistance.
- In many situations, unfortunately, they haven't really asked for international help, so it's a bit difficult, - said Mr. Sukko.
While Save the Children together in one team went to Palu, it was uncertain whether foreign personnel could work in the scene.
Mr. Sutopo, a national disaster adviser, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agency would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
>>zsm_Latn<< Based on the many earthquakes facing Indonesia, the country is not prepared to face natural disasters.
Although the tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a regular sight on the other coast.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lack of tsunami warning siren in Palu, although warning has been strong, it is as if it contributed to the loss of life.
>>zsm_Latn<< At best, traveling between islands of Indonesia is a real challenge.
>>zsm_Latn<< Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
>>zsm_Latn<< A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to care for the victim was heading to Palu, but it took at least three days to get to a new disaster location.
President Joko Widodo has made the drastic improvement of the infrastructure the main thing in his election campaign, and he has given a high allocation to the highway and railway runway.
But lack of funds has hit Jokowi's administration because he's faced with next year's reelection.
>>zsm_Latn<< Jokowi faced the pressure rather than the tension of the mazhab in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim Majority had received a more conservative understanding of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes because Christian groups and Muslims fought in the streets, using caves, bows and arrows, and other weapons.

>>zsm_Latn<< Cromwell Parliament's statue is a recent reminder of 'rewriting history'
>>zsm_Latn<< His removal would be poetic justice for the destruction of his Taliban with so many artistic and religious cultures done by his fanatic Puritan followers.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as ‘stupid' and ‘try to rewrite history.'
>>zsm_Latn<< John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “‘It can't be avoided in the discussion now about the removal of statues in which Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace would be targeted.

>>zsm_Latn<< As foretold, Rosa's Taufan was getting weaker as he moved to the cool waters on the north coast of Mexico.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, Rosa will bring heavy rains north of Mexico and southwest U.S. on the next day.
Rosa had 85 mph, Ribut Category 1, to 5 a.m., east of Sunday, 385 miles [385 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rosa was expected to move north on Sunday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Meanwhile, the troughs that began to form in the Pacific Ocean and moved east toward the U.S. Western Coast When Rosa approached the California Baja peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she began pushing the tropics north southwest of the U.S.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Then, tropical moisture interacts with the approaching trough which produces heavy rain in the Southwest the next day.
>>zsm_Latn<< Within the country, 1 to 4 inches of rain would cause a dangerous flood, the flow of debris and land collapse likely in the desert.
>>zsm_Latn<< Deep tropical humidity would cause the rainfall rate to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
>>zsm_Latn<< As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially more than Arizona.
Clouds of lightning may have been deep in the face of heavy rain caused by the tropical rain.

>>zsm_Latn<< Over 20 million people witnessed shocking testimony on Khamis by the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault was accused of occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television series.
>>zsm_Latn<< Meanwhile, political provisions were resumed, with the announcer interrupting regular programming for Friday's last minute touch: a deal designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Fake for the FBI to run a week's investigation on the charge.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was wearing him and trying to open his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his description, said 100 percent would never happen.
>>zsm_Latn<< It may be over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
>>zsm_Latn<< The company counted the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
>>zsm_Latn<< The numbers are not readily available for other networks showing the PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
>>zsm_Latn<< And Nielsen usually has problems measuring people watching in the office.
>>zsm_Latn<< To put in perspective, it is the size of the audience equal to the football game or the Award of the Academy.
Fox News Channel, who argued the host had supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the networks by a average of 5.69 million viewers listening all day, said Nielsen.
>>zsm_Latn<< ABC is second to 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen says.
>>zsm_Latn<< The opportunity to remain high after hearing.
>>zsm_Latn<< Flake is the main figure in this Friday drama.
>>zsm_Latn<< After a simple Republican official issued the fact that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested as a CNN and CBS camera in the morning of Friday was shouted by the protesters when he tried to ride a elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
>>zsm_Latn<< He stood with the eyes less effort for a few minutes when he spoke, being shown directly at CNN.
- I'm standing here in front of you, said a woman.
- Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, \"and you have authority when many women are weak.\"
“ Before the elevator was closed, ” says Flye, “his office took turns telling the committee that he was hearing a lot.
The network of cables and broadcasts covered the clocks directly later, when the Justice Committee chose to further Kavanaugh's reservations to the Senate to vote.
But Flye said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would see the charges against the next week's name, an urgent minority democracy.
Flye is sure some conversation with his friend, Democratic Sen.
>>zsm_Latn<< After the Coons and a few senators later, Fleke made a decision.
This Flexe option does have power, as it is clearly Republican won't have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.

>>zsm_Latn<< According to the authorities of Catalan nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the election taking place at the advertising station throughout this reservation in the violent battle.
Pro-freedom groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in favor of state police.

Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separator protest with his wife said he no longer hoped Catalonia's prospects for independence.
- Last time we went through one of our best moments of life.
I saw my parents crying because they could vote but now we're stuck, she says.
Although the management is important if it comes to victory in the confederacy election last December, the pro-freedom party of Katalan has been struggling to maintain this year's momentum with the famous leader who they have so many of them either in exile or in custody to wait for a trial for their role in regulating referendum and declaration of independence.

>>zsm_Latn<< Mention gives Livingstone a 1-0 victory over Rangers
>>zsm_Latn<< Dolly Manga's first Gol for Livingston gains victory
>>zsm_Latn<< Livingston's increase shocked Rangers to turn Steven Gerrard into a second defeat in 18 resistance as the club manager of the Hebox.
Dolly Menga's attack proved to be different when Gary Holt's army moved with Hibernian in the second place.
>>zsm_Latn<< Gerrard's forces remain without victory in the Premiership of this season and face the Head of Hearts, which they will trace with eight eyes, next Sunday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Before that, Rangers became the Rapid Vienna host in the European League on Khamis.
>>zsm_Latn<< Meanwhile, Livingston extended the relentless run in this section until six games, with the principal coach Holt who still felt defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against the opposing side
The Holt forces should be far ahead before casting the goal, with their involvement causing Rangers to deal with all the problems.
>>zsm_Latn<< Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his effort to pass the goal, but Alan Lithgow was only able to give up his effort after crossing into Craig Halkett's mound.
>>zsm_Latn<< The host is eager to let Rangers play in front of them, realizing they can trouble the opposing side with the set piece.
>>zsm_Latn<< And that is the way in which the important goal exists.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rangers admit a free piece and Livingstone opens the curtain, Declan Gallagher and Robinson join to establish Menga, which takes touch and goal tissue from the center of the box.
On that rank, Rangers have mastered ownership but have found a defence of the house that cannot break down and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly has largely no problem,
>>zsm_Latn<< The pattern goes on to half the second time, even though Alfredo Morelos forces to save Kelly.
>>zsm_Latn<< Scott Pittman was rejected by the goalkeeper Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow were dancing the goal of another Livingstone resistance.
>>zsm_Latn<< Crosses continued to enter the Livingston box and continued to clean up, while two penalty demands - after the challenge of Halkett's replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for a long hand ball - walking away.
>>zsm_Latn<< 'Fenomena' of Livingstone - analysis
>>zsm_Latn<< Lamont of BBC Scotland in Arena Tony Macaroni
>>zsm_Latn<< The feat and the result for Livingston.
To men, they're brilliant, they're going beyond the expectations of the trajectories up this.
>>zsm_Latn<< Their style of games and staff has hardly changed since returning to top rank, but great credit has had to go to Holt for him to launch troops since he came.
He has a lot of wheels.
>>zsm_Latn<< Captain Halkett is very brave, creating a great regular defense, while Menga keeps Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall across the toes.
Rangers lack inspiration, though.
>>zsm_Latn<< As good as they are sometimes under Gerrard, they fall away from that standard.
>>zsm_Latn<< The last ball was somewhat lacking - only once they cut the host team- and it was a call for Rangers waking up, which found themselves at the middle table.

>>zsm_Latn<< At least 384 people were killed, many were swept by a wave of terror that was swept off the coast, when an earthquake and a large tsunami struck Indonesia's island in Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hundreds of people gathered for a festival at the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when a wave of six meters (18 feet) swept off the land at noon, sweeps away a lot of deaths and destroys anything that was on their way.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
When the tsunami threat struck last night, many people were still on the beach and were not running and eventually killed. — Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a Japanese disaster agent BNPB, said in a short time in Jakarta.
>>zsm_Latn<< —Tsunami does not come by itself, it drags the train, the race, the house, it attacks its bill on land, - says Nugroho while adding that the tsunami has crossed the open sea with the speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before the blow at the edge.
Some climb trees to escape tsunamis and safety, he said.
>>zsm_Latn<< About 16,700 people have been transferred to 24 centers in Palulu.

He said that the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the collapse of the building and said 540 were injured and 29 people were still missing.
Nugrosho said that the death and destruction may be more terrible along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Dolaya, near the quake center.
>>zsm_Latn<< - Communication is completely disconnected without any information' from Dolayata, » says Nugroho.
- Less than 300,000 people live there, in fact, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading to the affected area.
- This is a tragedy but it can get worse, say the Red Cross.
The agency was strongly criticized last Saturday for notifying that the tsunami had hit Palu even though officials said that it was time for warnings to be given.

They told me that they had seen a lot of destroyed houses, he said.
It's so bad.
Although aid forces have begun to provide disaster relief in a hostile environment, some say that foreign aid workers with deep experience have been prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and delivery of foreign workers could be carried out only if disaster zones were announced.
That's not yet happening.
- It's still a disaster in the region stage, say Aulia Arriani, the Indonesian Red Cross spokesman.

- I don't think the message's coming, he said.

The United States should double artificial intelligence funds
- The United States should double the amount of funding in artificial intelligence because China has become more active in that field, - said the investor and the author of Kai-Fu Lee's intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
>>zsm_Latn<< The view was expressed after the U.S. government made announcements of artificial intelligence even though the United States itself lacked overall official intelligence strategy.
>>zsm_Latn<< Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year by aiming to be number 1 in the innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
- Multiplying artificial intelligence funding is a good start because all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to get the next success in artificial intelligence, says Lee
- By doubling funds can increase the next great chance of accomplishment of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States, - Lee said in the interview with CNBC this week.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lee's book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order' was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO of Innovation Ventures who have been investing in one of China's famous companies, Face++.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the 1980s, he attempted an artificial intelligence system that had defeated the American Othello player who was in the best position while still studying at the University of Carnegie Mellon, and then, he became executive at Microsoft Research and Google's president of the China branch.
Lee recognized a former U.S. government technology game such as Robot's Robot Challenge from the Defense Research Project Agency and wanted to know when the next match would be held so that he could identify the new talents.
- Investigators in the United States usually have to work hard to win the government's aid, says Lee.
>>zsm_Latn<< —Not China who takes the academic leaders but corporate companies, - says Lee.
>>zsm_Latn<< Facebook, Google and other technology companies have appointed great talents from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that the fundamental changes in immigration could also help the United States to support his creative efforts.
- I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD graduates in artificial intelligence, she says.
>>zsm_Latn<< The China State Assembly issued the Future Generation Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Science Foundation of Renewing So the China State provides funds to those in academic institutions, comparing the way the State Science Foundation and other government organizations divide funds to researchers in the United States but the academic work quality in China is lower, » says Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Department of Defense set up a collective Center for Intelligence aimed at gathering partners from industry and academy.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
>>zsm_Latn<< NSF, in turn, invests over $100 million each year in an AI investigation.

Macedonian people made a vote to change the country's name
>>zsm_Latn<< The Macedonians made a vote on Sunday to determine the change of names to the ‘North Macedonian Republic'. An act that would resolve disputes with Greece that had dissolved for a decade in which Greece had prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty (NATO).
Greece, with its own territory called Macedonia, asserted that the name ‘Macedonia' represented the demands on its territory and had forced to reject Macedonian inclusion in NATO and EU.
>>zsm_Latn<< The two kingdoms reached agreement regarding the proposed change of names in June but nationalist dissenters said the conversion humbled the ethnic identity of the Macedonians whose mainity of the population was Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he wouldn't vote in a vote and the opening raised doubts as to whether the vote would reach the minimum amount of 50 percent of the vote needed to make the vote valid.
>>zsm_Latn<< The question on undia is written: ‘Are you agreeing to join NATO and EU with acceptance of Greece'
Supporters of the name change include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said - Acceptance of the new name is a price paid to join the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that arose after the fall of Yugoslavia.
- I'm here today to vote for the country's future and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live free under the European Union because that means our lives are safer, - said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
While illegal on the side of the law, parliamentians said that they would comply with the decision of the union to make it a capital.
>>zsm_Latn<< The change in the name requires two-thirds of the majorities in the parliament.
The country’s election court said no reports of things that weren't done under the rules until 1 p.m.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, the attendance of the vote was 16 percent more than 34 percent in the parliamentary election in 2016 after 66 percent of the voter registered removed the undi paper.
- I came to vote because of my children, our place in Europe, says Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje's capital.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko discarded undi paper in Macedonia for the change of the country's name which would open the way to Macedonia to join NATO and EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
>>zsm_Latn<< In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and putting the chairs in front of the tent erected by the mob of the referendum.
- We want to join NATO and EU but we want to join it in pride rather than through this way-- said Kavadarkov.
- We are poor citizens but we have respect.
If they don't want to see us as a Macedonian people, we can turn towards China and Russia and become part of the European-Asia integration--
>>zsm_Latn<< Prime Minister Zaev said the inclusion within NATO would give Macedonia adequate investment where its unemployment rate exceeded 20 percent.
I believe the big majority will accept because more than 80 percent of our population chose the EU and NATO, said Zaev after the removal of the vote.
He said the decision ‘yes' was ‘our future uncertainty.'
One union was published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Police Studies, which said between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would take part in the vote - under the required amount.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another undy, run by Macedonia Telma TV, found 57 percent of the respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
>>zsm_Latn<< For a vote it succeeds the number of votes coming must be 50 percent plus a second.
>>zsm_Latn<< The failure in the vote would be considered the first serious slap to the pro-Read royal police since taking over in May last year.

>>zsm_Latn<< The English player forwards using his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who uses his right boot to kill the goalkeeper Brighton Mathew Ryan with one kick to the right of the net.
- Aguero struggles with his leg problems, the mayor of City Pep Guardiola told the reporters.
- We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he's laid the goal at that time.
>>zsm_Latn<< But Sterling gave Sky Blues an early advantage in the resistance of the Prime League.
>>zsm_Latn<< The goal occurs in 29 minutes.
>>zsm_Latn<< Aguero received an inner ball in the Brighton area on the resistance.
>>zsm_Latn<< He made a beautiful ball transmission through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sane took some touch before leading Sterling towards a distant position.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sky Blues forwards clapping the ball into the network before sliding out of bounds.

Scherzer wants to play alone against the Rockies
With the Nationals forces being cut off from the match, there's no reason to force another start.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the highly powerful Scherzer hoped to face the fort on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there were the effects of the play ran out for the Rockies, which held one game before the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rockies embrace at least a special opportunity place with 5-2 victories over the Nationals on Friday night, but still seek to lock up their first champion.
- Even though we're just playing, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and other troops will play perhaps at the highest stage I'll face this year.
Why don't I want to compete in that?
>>zsm_Latn<< Nationals still haven't announced beginners for Sunday, but reportedly tend to justify Scherzer making a reversal in this situation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Scherzer, who would make the start to 34, held a warm-up session on Thursday and would make a break on his usual rest day on Sunday.
>>zsm_Latn<< The driver who used the right hand of Washington was 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 hits right in 220 2/3 inning in this season.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump Assembly in West Virginia
>>zsm_Latn<< The president by not constantly referring to the situation around the High Court choosing Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the number of Republicans coming on mid-date elections.
- Whatever we have done will be in November.
Five more weeks to face the most important choice we will ever make in life.
I didn't fight, but I was very competitive and that's why I was everywhere fighting for a great candidate, she said.
Trump continues, - You see this bad Democratic radical group, you see it's happening now.
And they are intent on regaining power by using any means, you see cruelty, crime.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to disobey to gain power and lose. What they want is power and control, we won't give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on the mission to ‘remove and stop.'
- And you saw it four days ago, he said, calling the Democrats ‘ mad, evil and not true'
>>zsm_Latn<< He referred to the Senator of Justice Committee the position of Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who had received a strong boo from the audience.
Do you know the answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I'm waiting one - it's a very bad body language-- the worst language of the body I've ever seen--
Labor is no longer a large church.
It is not patient for anyone to voice their views
>>zsm_Latn<< When the Momentum activist in my local party voted to threaten me, it didn't emphasize.
Besides, I'm the latest in the Labor AP line being told that we're not welcome - all because we voice our views.
My parliamentary partner Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because he supported anti-yahudi.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the interest of responsibility about economic police, about national safety, about Europe, whose ironically issues are almost identical to what Jeremy did not approve of with the previous leader.
>>zsm_Latn<< The meeting notice for the East Labor Party Nottingham on Friday said we would want a meeting that included all and productively -
For nearly eight years as the local AP of Labor, the GC meeting on Friday night really included it.
Sadly today, it is not the tone for many meetings and political promises of ‘better, softer' have long been forgotten if, indeed, it has ever begun.
It's becoming even more evident that the difference in view is not acceptable in the Labor party and every opinion will be judged whether it is accepted by the party's leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as a former colleague, I thought sharing almost the same political views began to expect me to make a round of U and take a position that I would not agree on whether on national security or a single EU market.
When I spoke outside - and no story of what I was talking about - then I would be followed by the horror of using the social media, being told not to vote, denouncing the political center, trying to get me out of the workplace.
And that's not just my experience.
Of course, I knew I was better off than my workmates because I was commenting on my political career.
I was impressed by the professional behavior and the persistence of my workmates who were promised to swear sex and racism every day but never gave up.
>>zsm_Latn<< One aspect of the political frustration of this era is how the rate of injury has become accustomed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Last week Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labor party develop cultural tolerance.
>>zsm_Latn<< The reality is that we are no longer a broad church and with every ‘untrusted' or change in electoral regulations, parties become increasingly narrow.
>>zsm_Latn<< I received much advice since two years ago urging me to keep quiet, not too prominent and then I would ‘be good.'
But it was not my goal to get involved in politics.
Since I joined Labor 32 years ago as a school student, it was raised by the government of Thatcher who allowed my entire class to be destroyed, I have tried to pursue better public service for those who really need one another — either as a local meeting member or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including my previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East might be confused about my position and the sides of the conflict with the current leadership.
To those who support the proposal on Friday, what I want to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it will waste our home, business and public service, I don't understand how it takes time and energy for my loyalty to the Labor Party leader.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voter, whether it's a worker or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise the threat of unelected or political conformity doesn't prevent me from acting in what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Animated Ayr climbs to the summit
>>zsm_Latn<< Two slow trials may make the final decision adjourned, but no doubt Ayr deserves success in the contest of the interesting and entertaining Premiership Tennent match.
They are now at the top of the table, the only one that has never lost out of 10 people.
>>zsm_Latn<< Finally, their superior defense, as much as they took the opportunity, which made Peter Murchie's hosts and trainers happy.
- We've been tested for our game so far, and we still can't be defeated, so I must be happy, he said.
>>zsm_Latn<< Robyn Christie of Melrose said: \"Praised to Ayr, they take a chance better than we\"
>>zsm_Latn<< Grant Anderson conducted a test in the 14th minute, conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, was issued for resistance by Warriors, allowing Melrose to make the network and Jason Baggot caught an unconversioned trial.
>>zsm_Latn<< Climo precedes Ayr with a penalty, before, at half of the time, he gets an eye then attempts of solo conversion to make 17-5 to Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started the second time with a good time and a test of Patrick Anderson, a conversion by Baggot, reducing the raft to five eyes.
There was a long period of exposure due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was brought out, and from the beginning, Ayr continued to face again through the trial of Stafford McDowall, conversion by Climo.
>>zsm_Latn<< Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose responded to an additional player with an unconversion to Bruce Colvine, at the end of a fierce pressure period.
>>zsm_Latn<< The host team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card due to Climo's takel without a ball, from the outline of the penalty, MacPherson broke behind hit the next Ayr.
>>zsm_Latn<< Climo the conversion, as he did almost at the outset, after Kyle Rowe picked up the kick of David Armstrong's box and sent far-fetcher Gregor Henry to test the five host forces.
>>zsm_Latn<< Still Game stars are seen ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
>>zsm_Latn<< Still Game Ford Kieran star was seen to be willing to move to the hospital industry after he was named director for the retired restaurant company.
>>zsm_Latn<< 56 years old acted as Jack Jarvis in a famous BBC plan, where he wrote and stars along with Greg Hemphill's old comedies.
The couple had announced that the ninth party was the last one in the plan, and it seems that the Kiernan was planning for the rest of her life after Craiglang.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to official records, he was the director for Adriftmorn Limited.
>>zsm_Latn<< The actor refused to comment on the story, even though the Scottish Sun's source gave a hint that Kiernan wanted to engage himself in ‘a growing restaurant trade.'
'The path is ours': Bolivia that surrounds the land hoping the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors at the naval headquarters of La Paz.
The general building sent out the blue flag of the sea.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to Amazon is confused with the motto: 'The path is our real possession.
To get back is a responsibility. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
>>zsm_Latn<< Throughout Bolivia surrounded the land, memory lost coast to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still clear - like a desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
This hope may have been the highest in the century, for Bolivia was still awaiting the decision of the International Court on October 1, after five years of discussion.
-Bolivia has momentum, spirit of unity and peace, and certainly hopes for a positive decision, - said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch ICJ’s decision on a large screen around the country, hoping that Hague’s hearing will support Bolivia’s demands - after centuries of discussing Chile’s plans to give Bolivia a sovereign position at sea level.
>>zsm_Latn<< Evo Morales, a charismatic native president of Bolivia - who faced controversial resistance for next year's recombination - also a great deal of interest in Monday's decision.
- We were so close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision on Bolivia's side - and if it happens, it will change very little.
The United Nations agency in the Netherlands has been unable to give Chile territory, and has determined that she will not decide on the possibility of the discussion.
>>zsm_Latn<< Regarding the decision of ICJ that will come out only after six months of final argument is heard to indicate the case - uncomplicated, - said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
>>zsm_Latn<< And not to slow down Bolivia's base again, during these four years there may be obstacles.
>>zsm_Latn<< -Isu for passage to the sea has been seized by Bolivia's administration now, - says Zárate.
>>zsm_Latn<< Morales' rhetorical hostility has reduced the little Chilen compassion, he suggests.
Bolivia and Chile at one point will continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to have a discussion after this.
>>zsm_Latn<< Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s deputy in Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was usually quick.
>>zsm_Latn<< Monday would bring a great chance of opening up a new era's connection with Chile - and a chance to end the 139-year engagement for mutual good, she said.
>>zsm_Latn<< Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the famous presidents in Latin America - used maritime issues as political aid.
- Bolivia never gave up on her right to get a passage to the Pacific Ocean, adding her.
- This decision is an opportunity to see that we need to forget the past
North Korea says a nuclear assault will not happen unless it trusts the U.S.
North Korean Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not commit their nuclear weapons first if he didn't trust Washington.
He spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to fulfill the promises made during the peak assembly in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments appeared because U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to want to start a nuclear diplomacy that had been suspended more than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ri said he was ‘just a dream' which was a continuous partition and the U.S. opposition to the declaration of ending the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
>>zsm_Latn<< Washington was careful to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang first making important acts of weapon lashing.
>>zsm_Latn<< Both Kim and President of the U.S. Donald Trump wanted a second peak hearing.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is seriously responsible for launching a weapon that is seen as the only way to guarantee the safety of his country.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump peak trial.

>>zsm_Latn<< John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
>>zsm_Latn<< Scotland's private schools kept a record of achievement for academic intelligence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of brilliant exam decisions, reinforced by individuals and collective success in sports, art, music and other community ventures.
>>zsm_Latn<< With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Swatta Schools (SCIS) Society, seeks to give services at the best rank to their students and parents.
>>zsm_Latn<< The goal of private schools is to prepare their students to continue their higher education, their career of choice, and their place of global citizens.
>>zsm_Latn<< As the educational sector they could and carried out the earlier school curriculum, we saw modern languages continue to be well known and the subject of the choice of yamg desired within the school.
Nelson Mandela said: - If you talk to a man in a language that you understand, it'll go into his head.
If you talk to her in her mother's language it's going into her heart--
This is a strong reminder that we should not rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< From the decision of this year's exam, we can see that language is the top subject in the league table with the highest degree of graduation in private schools.
>>zsm_Latn<< A total of 68 percent of students learning foreign languages get higher A grade.
This data, collected by 74 SCIS students, showed 72 percent of the students having a higher grade A in Mandarin, and 72 percent of them studied in German, 69 percent of them learning French and 63 percent in Spanish.
>>zsm_Latn<< This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills children and young people are no doubt going to need them in the future
>>zsm_Latn<< Now, as the subject of choice, is being held the same as the subject of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
>>zsm_Latn<< Search Pinyin research by UK Employment and Skills Suragents in 2014 found reasons employers struggled to meet the void, 17 percent were associated with a lack of language skills.
For that reason, language skills become the norm in order to prepare young people for a career in the future.
>>zsm_Latn<< With more opportunities of prospective work requiring language, this skill is essential in this global world.
>>zsm_Latn<< Regardless of a person's career of choice, if they learn a second language, they will have real advantages in the future by having such experience in life.
>>zsm_Latn<< Being able to communicate constantly with people from foreign countries will put someone who automatically masters many languages in front of competition.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to YouGov's second of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent should not speak a foreign language well enough for conversation, with French as a language spoken only by two percent digits, 15 percent.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is why investment in language teaching is now important for children today.
>>zsm_Latn<< Having a variety of languages, especially the country is building its economy, would complete children with a better chance of finding meaningful work.
>>zsm_Latn<< In Scottland, every school will be different in the language they are learning.
>>zsm_Latn<< The school will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach what is seen is very important to the UK when looking forward in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there are often a lot of languages that can be selected from private schools, with the teaching power that is the expert in that section.
>>zsm_Latn<< Scotland's private schools are dedicated to providing a learning atmosphere that will prepare children and provide them with the necessary skills to succeed, anything that happens in the future.
>>zsm_Latn<< It cannot be denied at this time, in the global business environment, which language continues to be crucial to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
>>zsm_Latn<< Indeed, modern languages should be considered ‘international communication skills.'
>>zsm_Latn<< Private schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and brilliance for the youth class in Scotland.

>>zsm_Latn<< Trump Assembly Time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started an emergency meeting campaign tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
>>zsm_Latn<< It was the first Trump assembly of five scheduled next week, including stopping in the mesra place including Tennessee and Mississippi.
>>zsm_Latn<< With the confirmation vote being held for him to choose to satisfy the void in the Federal Court, Trump is spending to gain support for the mid-discovered elections will come because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in Nov.
>>zsm_Latn<< What are Trump meetings in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump Assembly at Wheeling in West Virginia was scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
>>zsm_Latn<< You can watch Trump meetings in West Virginia online via a stream directly on YouTube.
Trump is likely to handle this week's trial for the potential Presidential Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense over the accusations of sexual misconduct with the conviction of the Senate that was expected to be held for a week during the FBI's investigation.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the main target of this urgent assembly was to help the Republican get momentum in the face of the November election.
Thus, the President Trump's campaign said five meetings in the next week were utnuk - a summary of volunteers and supporters because the Republicans tried to protect and develop the majorities they had in the Senate and the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
- The Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president will go to as many countries as possible to our busy campaign season, - Trump campaign spokesman who doesn't want to be named at Reuters.
>>zsm_Latn<< Scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's meetings can bring support from -Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh's media, - according to West Virginia Metro News.
>>zsm_Latn<< Saturday would be the second time last month Trump had visited West Virginia, the country he won over 40 percent of the eyes in 2016.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump was trying to help the candidate of the West Virginia Republican Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who was following him in the election.
- It wasn't a good sign for Morrisey until the president had to come to support him, - said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at Western Virginia University, according to Reuters.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. troops showed courage to fight in making sure hope was still there towards a single-day fight on Sunday
>>zsm_Latn<< After three partial resistance, the corner resistance on Saturday afternoon is probably what Ryder Cup needs this time.
>>zsm_Latn<< Momentum swings is the concept of sports which is one creation but it is completely trusted by players, and more in this kind of game.
So, where does the moment seem to be now?
- They have six eyes and now they're four eyes, so we bring a little moment, I think,-- Jordan Spieth said when he walked at the end of the day.
Europe certainly had advantages, four eyes in front with twelve more eyes to take.
>>zsm_Latn<< American players, as Spieth says, felt they had little excess and felt driven, not only by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each had three of the four eyes.
>>zsm_Latn<< Spieth plays a powerful game from the beginning to the green area and serves as an example to other players.
>>zsm_Latn<< The lively sound becomes stronger when he continues to chin, performing an important rubber punch to fit four eyes when he and Thomas are missing after two eyes.
>>zsm_Latn<< His rounds that gave them a victory on the 15th hole were greeted with the same noise, which tells you that he believed the American army was still fighting.
- You just have to work harder and worry about your own resistance, says Spieth.
That's all there is for all these players right now.
>>zsm_Latn<< 18 holes to show power.
>>zsm_Latn<< Only two players with more eyes than Spieth and Thomas since two days ago were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the story in the Undecidable Ryder Cup.
>>zsm_Latn<< The pair of different players is interesting from this Europe but closes four eyes out of four and does not seem to make any mistake.
>>zsm_Latn<< -Moliwood - is the only couple who did not do the night on Saturday evening, but they also spent the night on Saturday morning, Friday evening and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The period and the way their energy is supplied and demonstrated by supporters is proof that they were players to be killed on Sunday, and no player is more popular to deny the possibility of European victory during the sunset in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molonari.
Well, both of them are in a different hole.
However, the conversation with the European army was too early.
Bubb Watson and Webb Simpson made it easier for Sergio Garcia, four players in the morning, when he was compared to Alex Noren.
One night two or two in the first nine holes opened the Spanish player and the Swedish player.
However, on Sundays no one can help you.
>>zsm_Latn<< Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch closer by interaction between couples, advice given and not given and strategies that can change in the blink of an eye.
>>zsm_Latn<< Europe plays better as an army so far and precedes far on the last day but these four sessions also show the U.S. Army's kidnapping of courage previously doubted by many parties, including local fans.
>>zsm_Latn<< The European army headed 10-6 towards the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe brought on the last day the Ryder Cup, after rising from four ball resistances and four players with 10-6 eyes up to the United States.
>>zsm_Latn<< Both great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari precede with two victories over Tiger Woods struggling to bring their victory in Le Golf National to four eyes.
>>zsm_Latn<< The European forces led by Thomas Bjorn tried to keep the trophies seized in Hazeltine two years ago, mastering the erroneous American forces in the morning four-ball session, with a 3-1 series eye.
>>zsm_Latn<< The U.S. troops gave more competition in four players' games, won two resistances, but could not scale the cliffs.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 eyes of 12 eyes in a one-day fight to keep the trophi.
>>zsm_Latn<< Fleetwood was the first new European player to win the four consecutive eyes while he and Molinari, dubbed -Molliwood - after the end of the week the sensation was the second pair to win four eyes of their four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
>>zsm_Latn<< After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they later together defeated the Woods and the new American player, Bryson Dechambeau in the 5&4 resistance.
>>zsm_Latn<< Woods, who went through two tough resistance on Saturday, demonstrated brightness but has now lost in 19 of the 29 resistance of four balls and four players and seven in a row.
>>zsm_Latn<< Justin Rose, who did not take a break during the four-ball morning session, was back in line with Henrik Stenson in a match of four players to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 - occupying a position of one and three in the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< Europe was not well blessed on a quiet and relaxed day in southwest Paris.
>>zsm_Latn<< The major winners three times, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became measuring wood for America with two eyes on Saturday.
>>zsm_Latn<< They won 2&1 killing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in the fight of four balls and then again killed Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 resistance in the game four players killed on two opening holes.
>>zsm_Latn<< Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team that is missing four eyes towards the independence resistance, even though as the defend champion of the Furyk army only needs a series to maintain the trofi.
After spending two days in the second place, the Sunday morning’s fighting seemed to be out of reach.
North Korea said 'unbelievable' they would voluntarily disarm without trust
>>zsm_Latn<< North Korea's Minister told the United Nations Society on Saturday, the partition continued to cause their deep distrust of the United States and it is unlikely that his country would voluntarily release nuclear weapons in the situation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ri Yong Ho told the World's annual General Assembly, North Korea had taken - an important crisis step - in the past year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, shutting down nuclear exams and promising not to extend the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
- However, we did not see any reasonable response from the U.S., he said.
- Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in the safety of our country and in such a state, there's no way we're going to disarm the gun first--
Although Ri complains against North Korea about Washington's opposition to the - slowing approach - the end of the nuclear power in which North Korea will be rewarded for taking a step backwards, it does seem important because it does not reject voluntary rejection as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to the combined reality issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in the first peak trial between the president of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promises to attempt to attempt the nuclear re-explanation of the Korean peninsula — while Trump guarantees North Korea's safety.
North Korea was trying to finish for the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang had to release his nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to comply with the proposal to loosen the international ban on North Korea.
>>zsm_Latn<< TheAS assert - pre-examination - and increase the pressure levels in the ban to achieve their goal in force, and even oppose — the declaration of the end of the war, says Ri.
The thought that bans could weaken us was an empty dream that people who did not know us.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the problem is constant restrictions that make our disbelief worse--
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the United States leader was in the United Nations conference at the beginning of this week.
>>zsm_Latn<< The minister mentions only three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in in the last five months and adds: -If the party on this issue of the suspension was South Korea and not the U.S., the nuclear attention of the Korean peninsula would not find a settlement--
>>zsm_Latn<< However, Ri's tone was dramatically different than last year, when he told the U.S. General Assembly that spread the large US land with North Korea rockets could not be avoided after the - Mr. Good President - Trump named Kim a rocket man in the mission of suicide.
>>zsm_Latn<< This year at the United Nations Assembly conference, Trump, who last year threatened to \"complete\" - North Korea, praising Kim for her courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and the ban had to take place until North Korea ended her nuclear program.
>>zsm_Latn<< On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for this, saying 'If it took two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter--
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: \"The restriction of the Security Council must be carried on with earnest and without failure until we feel fully nuclear suspension, muctamad and passed-
>>zsm_Latn<< The Security Council has been a total vote of increasing partitions over North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to disband nuclear-driven bullet programs and Pyongyang ballistics.
Pompeo met Ri outside the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second peak trial.
Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been achieved, only for North Korea within a few hours of which he had condemned himself for making - a rule like gangster-
>>zsm_Latn<< North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to expose the fueled bullets as well as nuclear complexes if the United States was taking a corresponding step--
She says Kim has told her that--the same steps-- that Kim's looking for are security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and headed towards a normal relationship with Washington.
>>zsm_Latn<< Harvard students have taken courses to get enough rest
>>zsm_Latn<< A new course at Harvard University this year has given all her students more sleep in an effort to combat a culture of learning that is becoming increasingly through 'all night' based on caffeine.
A teacher force found students at the university number one world often couldn't understand the basics to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Brigham and Women Hospital, prepared a course that he believed was the first one in the United States.
He obtained permission to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation during the study.
'At the end of that course, a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I told only about this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - and that surprised me, she told The Telegraph.
The course was introduced three times this year, explaining to the students the need for good sleep habits to help them achieve academic and sports, and to improve their well - being.
>>zsm_Latn<< Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university health executive director said, the university decided to introduce the course after finding her students sleeping less throughout the week.
>>zsm_Latn<< The course for an hour involved several interactive tasks.
In part, there is an image of a boarding chamber, where students click on coffee cups, bricks, trainers, and books to tell them about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports achievements are affected by sleep deprivation and the need for regular sleep.
On the other hand, participants were told how long - term sleep deprivations could increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
>>zsm_Latn<< Maps with interactive icons, then encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change the student's behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effect of choosing to smoke, plus Prof. Czeisler.
>>zsm_Latn<< The culture of pride in ‘keeping all night' still exists, he says, while adding that modern technology and increased pressure on learners means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you have enough sleep quality, it should be a 'secret weapon' of the learner to combat pressure, fatigue and anxiety, he says--even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain into a starving mode, making it always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old California student who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design this course, after taking his class last year at Harvard.
>>zsm_Latn<< He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to develop the course throughout the campus.
>>zsm_Latn<< The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postschool students to complete the same learning program before joining a competitive institution.
>>zsm_Latn<< Prof Czeisler suggests that students should consider the use of alarm clocks before and also after sleep, and realize the risk of ' blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can impair your circulation rhythm from moving, causing sleep problems.
>>zsm_Latn<< Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gol Menga killed Gerrard's men
>>zsm_Latn<< Rangers experienced another defeat in the opponent's place when the Dolly Mena network tied up the weak army of Steven Gerrard with a 1-0 defeat at Livingstone.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Ibrax army was still looking for the first victory in the opponent's place since the February 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's army gave the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 resistance as a manager to cause his army to leave eight eyes behind the predecessor of the Ladbrokes Premiership league, Hearts.
The explosion in the seventh minute before the first half of the time and the Rangers seemed to have no idea of equal position.
With Rangers now down to the sixth place, Livingstone climbs to the third stairs and is just behind Hibernian with a goal difference.
And Rangers may deal with the problem again after the linekeeper, Calum Spence is forced to be treated for head injury after the object has been transferred from the area of his army.
>>zsm_Latn<< Gerrard made eight exchanges on his team that went to the end of the Betfred Cup after defeating Ayr.
Holt kept Livi's 11 team, who stole an eye from Hearts last week, and he must have been happy with the way his team's game was worried about their opponents at all times.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rangers may have mastered the game but Livingstone carried out more trials on goal.
>>zsm_Latn<< They were supposed to land the goal only after two minutes when the first touch of Mena gave the room to Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal but the middle player was missed.
Free kick from the back of Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his defender Alan Lithgow could only send a ball behind the goal.
Rangers succeeded in regaining mastery but he lived only hope for the last thirty minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he was supposed to be given a penalty in the twenty-five minutes when he and Steven Lawless connected but Steven Thomson's commander let the Colombian player's plea.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rangers only successfully presented two trials right within the first half of the first time but former goalkeepers Hebox, Liam Kelly easily deducted Lassana Coulibaly and the weak side of Ovie Ejaria.
Even though Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be contrary to the scope of the game, no one can deny their chance.
Rangers once again failed to deal with Jacobs' planned moves.
Scott Arfield was only stiff when Declan Gallagher dragged the ball to Scott Robinson who quietly sent it to Menga for an easy finish.
>>zsm_Latn<< Gerrard made the exchange during the break time by exchanging Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and he almost gave an immediate impression when the wing player gave the ball to Morelos but Kelly was amazingly out of his area to block.
>>zsm_Latn<< But Livingston continued to make it difficult for the opponents to play the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sent a long transmission for long distances.
>>zsm_Latn<< Holt's forces were supposed to spread a cliff in the final stages but McGregor stood well to deny Jacobs before the Lithgow horn was diverted from the goal corner.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rangers' replacement player, Glenn Middleton begs another piece of penalty when he is connected to Jacobs but again Thomson does not miss it.
Almanak: Geiger Count Creator
>>zsm_Latn<< And now, the page from Almanak — Our Sunday morning — September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and it is correct...the day on which the physicist Johannes Wilhelm -Hans - Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to the device known as the Geigers.
>>zsm_Latn<< As the main basis of science since, Kaunter Geiger became the backbone of pop culture, as in the film -Bells of Coronado - in 1950, starring by anonymous scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
- What's that?
>>zsm_Latn<< Rogers: - It is Geiger's thinker, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the effect of the atom that radioactivity has on the mineral -
Evans: Yes, it sounds right now!
>>zsm_Latn<< -Hans - Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his birth day of the63th.
But creation, which bears his name, is eternal.

>>zsm_Latn<< The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab so that they can -see - a protein that is common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then reinjecting cells.
>>zsm_Latn<< Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: ← Our test decisions show that we have a very good vaccine -
>>zsm_Latn<< HER2–causes the growth of several types of cancers, - including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectals, clearly Prof Berzofsky.
>>zsm_Latn<< The same approach to taking immune cells out of the patient and - instructing - their way of targeting cancer cells has been successful in treating the type of leukemia.
>>zsm_Latn<< Kanye West Joins Pro-Trump Cercaan, Eating AGA's Top, after her SNL Appearance.
It Was Not Well Received
Kanye West was mocked at the studio on Saturday Night Live after a great show where she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would compete in 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< After bringing his third song that night called Ghost Town where he wore the ‘Make America Great' hat, he continued to oppose the Democrat and repeat his support for Trump.
I often asked white people, and they said, ‘How can you support Trump, she's a prejudiced person?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America to an early age, he said.
>>zsm_Latn<< SNL started a presentation with a sketch that Matt Damon had visited where the Hollywood star wanted Brett Kavanaugh's recognition in front of the Senate Justice Committee regarding the sexual assault charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, Kanye West's footage was uploaded to social media by Miss Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to mock West with the shipment.
>>zsm_Latn<< Also, West has complained to an audience he has had difficulties behind the stage about his hat.
- They took me to the back of the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They beat me!
Then they said, I'm in an unimportant place, he said, according to Washington Examiner.
The West adds: \"You want to see that useless position\" by saying that he's going to eat my superman coat, because this means you can't lead me.
>>zsm_Latn<< Try to love -
>>zsm_Latn<< His comments invited ridicule at least twice from the audience and SNL actors looked ashamed, Variety's report, with someone there telling the publication: ← The whole studio became empty -
West has been brought in instead of Ariana Grande's singer, where her former boyfriend, Mac Miller's singer died a few days ago.
West surprises a lot of people with a song show I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Box.
>>zsm_Latn<< West received support from the chairman of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner who sent a cynication: - To one of the most bold: TERIMA FOR YOU THE FIREMENTS OF THE CRITITICAL CITICAL
>>zsm_Latn<< But a spark from the interview host, Karen Hunter says West is just--to be himself and that's really great-
>>zsm_Latn<< -But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting -seni - his) that I believed accepted and shared an ideology that threatened my community.
He's free.
We too, she added.
>>zsm_Latn<< Before the show, the rap singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now known as the one he used to be known as Kanye West -
>>zsm_Latn<< He was not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
>>zsm_Latn<< His friend, a rap singer, Snoop Dogg once changed his name to Snoop Lion and certainly his song referred to legend music, Prince, who changed his name to symbol and later also as an artist previously known as Prince.
>>zsm_Latn<< Accused of attempted murder in the scene of the nail at a Belfast restaurant

>>zsm_Latn<< The Game of Thrones Star, Kit Torton divides toxic masculine
>>zsm_Latn<< Kit Harington is famous for the character of the sword hero as Jon Snow in mid-HBO fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the actor, 31 years old, has bred the stereotype of the maco hero, by calling his characters played on the screen meaning young people often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
>>zsm_Latn<< Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something wrong' and questioned how to deal with toxic masculine problems in the #MeToo era.
>>zsm_Latn<< Kit, who recently married a match star Games of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admits she feels 'very strong' about handling the problem.
>>zsm_Latn<< 'I think it's somewhat personally strong, at the present - where is our fault with the masculine?,' he said.
'What did we teach men when they grew up, in terms of the trouble we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the increased toxicity masculinity due to his very masculine people.
>>zsm_Latn<< He added: 'What is the natural cause and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes boys feel they need to be men like this?
I think it's an important question now - how do we change it?
Because there's obviously something wrong with the young man today.'
>>zsm_Latn<< In the interview, she also admits she won't perform any prefix or follow the Game of Thrones when the series ends in the summer to come, saying she's already 'completed with the field of war and horse'.
>>zsm_Latn<< In November, Kit would be staring at the True West rescinded film by Sam Shepard which is the story of a movie showman and his brother, a robber.
>>zsm_Latn<< The actor recently revealed he considered meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best thing that happened in the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this plan, so that way, it gave me a family of the future and my life began here,' he said.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rose brings the story of Ygritte, the love of Jon Snow's heart played by Kit, in the fantasy series that won the Emmy's gift.
They were married in June 2018 in Scotland, east of the Leslie family.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase for new cases
>>zsm_Latn<< China has announced a 14% increase for the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected, says health officials.
>>zsm_Latn<< An estimated 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 only.
Most new cases are sexually transmitted, marking changes that have occurred in the past.
Normally, HIV was quickly spread through parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfers.
However, the number of HIV sufferers in this way was reduced to nearly zero, and Chinese health officials told of a trial in the Yunnan region.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, year after year, the number of HIV and AIDS sufferers in China has increased by 100,000 people.
>>zsm_Latn<< The spread of HIV through sex is a serious issue in China's LGBT community.
>>zsm_Latn<< Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people was said to be becoming more and more.
Because of the country's conservative value, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
In many cases, the spread of disease is due to the lack of adequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV as a part of its efforts to deal with the problem.
>>zsm_Latn<< Maxine Waters denied his staff leaking GOP senator data, bridging 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiration theory'
>>zsm_Latn<< U.S. Representatives of Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced an employee who has displayed personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawbreaker Wikipedia page.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed the claim had been spread by experts ← ultra-rights » and web pages.
>>zsm_Latn<< - Fraud, fraud and more severe fraud, - said Waters in one fact on Twitter.
This information is reported to include home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
>>zsm_Latn<< The information appeared online on Thursday, broadcast by strangers at Capitol Hill on hearing of the Senate panel on the charge of sexual misconduct against the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
>>zsm_Latn<< The leak of information occurred after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
>>zsm_Latn<< Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report IP addresses that identify the sure root of the mailing associated with Waters officials and spread information of Waters staff members, Hill said.
- This inconsequential charge is false and one lie, - Waters says it again.
- My contact - where his identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised because of this false charge - is completely unrelated to the leak of this information.
>>zsm_Latn<< This unsustainable charge is completely false and deceptively-shaped-
>>zsm_Latn<< Waters' reality is quick to invite online criticism, including from former White House newspaper secretary, Ari Fleischer.
>>zsm_Latn<< - This reflection is angry, - write Fleischer.
- This shows that he has no features to become a Congressman.
When someone is accused of doing something they don't do, they can't get upset.
They can't resist.
They can't question the prosecutor's motives.
They must be calm
>>zsm_Latn<< Fleischer says when comparing the reaction of Waters and Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, accused by a critic who appeared too angry at the hearing of Thursday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who fought to kill Waters in the mid-election, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
- It's great news that it's true, she's hacking.
>>zsm_Latn<< In fact, Waters says his office has notified -the ruling party in terms of and the law enforcement entity regarding this false charge.
We will make sure the perpetrators will be revealed, he said, and they will be responsible for all their actions that can destroy and be dangerous to anyone and all my staff.
>>zsm_Latn<< Johnny English Strikes Against - weak Rowan Atkinson intelligence fraud
>>zsm_Latn<< It is now common to find Brexit signs in any new film with a British slang and it seems to be used for the revival of the francais of Johnny English action fraud - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Do we complain about how bad it is to become a new country export opportunity?
Whatever the case, Johnny English, who likes to stare at her tired face, has the opportunity to ruin her state for the second time — more than all the facts — that she is a widespread comic creation designed for a non - English - language audience region.
>>zsm_Latn<< He is certainly a stupid secret agent who has a strange face to relax the gladmor has the nature of Clouteau, a few Mr. Bean and a musician who contributes a note to the Chariots of Fire's theme song on the 2012 London Olympic Opening Program.
He was also inspired by a mysterious international traveller and spy agent, Rowan Atkinson, who once appeared in the now forgotten Barclay television advertisement, leaving a mess after that.
>>zsm_Latn<< There is one or two great time in the latest JE film.
I liked Johnny English as he approached the helicopter, dressed in a medieval suit of armor, and tied the fan blade to his helmet.
>>zsm_Latn<< Atkinson's burn for physical comedy is being aired, but the noise is very weak and strange, especially the film-filem-serius-like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offers comedy as their material.
>>zsm_Latn<< The sensation is felt as if it was highlighted for children than adults, and to me Johnny English's accidental mistake is to be uninnovated and focused on Atkinson's films in the Bean person.
>>zsm_Latn<< The main premise is Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyberfighter has infiltrated the British web web network, exposed the identity of all British agents in the field and failed the agent in charge - a very small figure for Kevin Eldon.
>>zsm_Latn<< It was the last chance for the arrogant prime minister and who was struggling with political collapses as well as unpopular: Emma Thompson gave the best with the side of Teresa May but nothing good in the script for her character.
>>zsm_Latn<< The gatherer tells him every active spy has been compromised, and he needs to call someone out of retirement.
>>zsm_Latn<< And that means Johnny English himself, who is stingy and is now working as a school teacher in some luxury places, but provides an inappropriate lesson to be a secret agent: some nice joke here, because English offers an in-depth science such as the School of Rock.
>>zsm_Latn<< English was brought back to Whitehall for emergency tactics and reunited with his former helper Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, lying down with a submarine commander, a scattered figure brought by a rather damaging Vicki Pepperdine.
>>zsm_Latn<< So, Batman and Robin, who are skilled in the Secret Service of the Most High Duli, are back on action in the face of the beautiful female poacher Ophelia Bulletin by Olga Kurylenko.
>>zsm_Latn<< Meanwhile, the prime minister was being affected by millions of charismatic technology workers who accused him of being able to solve British computer problems: Jason Volta was a malicious and played by Jake Lacy.
>>zsm_Latn<< English and Bough started their adventure with a small task: disguised as a servant, lighting a fire and burning a French restaurant; struggling to smuggle himself into Volta's luxury cruise ship; and English provoked the chaos when he tried to use Maya's Realita's head font to familiarize himself inside Volta's house.
>>zsm_Latn<< All of the funny scenes were well brought up for the last round, but because it looks mesra and lows there is little sense like a child's television show about it.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is a rather simple film.
And just like the other movies of Johnny English, I kept thinking: shouldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that really fits his talent?
>>zsm_Latn<< Labor Party designed for British people working four days a week but paid for five days
>>zsm_Latn<< The head of the Labor Party, Jeremy Corbyn considered a radical plan that would witness British citizens working four days a week - but paid for five days.
>>zsm_Latn<< The party reportedly wanted the company's boss-bos to pass the inspection made through an artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the workers by giving them an extra day of leave.
>>zsm_Latn<< He will see the staff enjoying the weekend for three days - but still bring back the same pay.
>>zsm_Latn<< The source said, the idea was 'suited' with the party' economic agenda and plans to bring the country in favor of the workers.
>>zsm_Latn<< Refer to work for four days a week supported by the Working Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
>>zsm_Latn<< One right source of the Labor Party told The Sunday Times: 'The basic study was expected to be announced before the end of this year.
>>zsm_Latn<< 'It will not apply overnight but work for four days a week is an aspiration that corresponds to the party's approach to balance the economy and take sides with the workers as well as the overall industry strategy of the party.'
>>zsm_Latn<< The Labor Party was not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party promising a work week for four days in the election campaign in 2017.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, this aspiration was not fully supported by the Labor Party.
>>zsm_Latn<< A Labor Party spokesman said: 'Working for four days is not the basis of the party and it is not considered by the party.'
>>zsm_Latn<< Denselor, John McDonnell used the previous week's Labor trial by advancing his vision for socialist revolutions in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he decided to take power away from the 'faceless director' and 'catut' in the utility firm.
>>zsm_Latn<< The shadow canellor plan also means that the current stakeholders in the water company may not regain their entire stock because the Labor government can make 'cut' based on the reason they are deemed to do wrong.
>>zsm_Latn<< He also passed a plan to put workers in the company's director agency and created an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand in 10 percent of private sector firm equity to workers, who would receive annual dividers up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told -60 Minute - whether the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could change their minds
>>zsm_Latn<< The FBI's guilt in charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh had delayed his last vote to the Supreme Court at least for a week, and raised the question as to whether the discovery of the bureau could influence Republican senators to provide their support.
In a public interview that was broadcast on Sunday, reporter -60 Minute - Scott Pelley asked Senator Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy looks more open than his friend from South Carolina.
- I'm sorry, of course, - said Kennedy.
- I told you to attend the trial, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, which charge appeared, and said, 'Did you do it?'
>>zsm_Latn<< He is firm, seedy, clear -
In any case, Graham's union has already been determined.
- I've already made Brett Kavanaugh's teng and he'll take a heavy charge, he said.
>>zsm_Latn<< —Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know about this: Brett strongly denies it, α plus Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
- And everyone he calls can't make it difficult.
It's been 36 years.
The reason we don't see any changes -
Is the World’s Largest Convention, and Does It Do Any Good to Reduce Poverty?
On this Saturday, New York will be hosting the World People's Festival, an annual musical event that has a wonderful array of stars and an equally great mission; ending the world's poverty.
>>zsm_Latn<< Now in the seventh year, the World People's Feast will see tens of thousands of people assembled on Central Park Island not only to watch such shows as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event ending poverty that culminated in 2030.
>>zsm_Latn<< The World People's Party, started in 2012, was an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international support group aimed at eliminating poverty by increasing the number of people actively opposing it.
>>zsm_Latn<< To receive this event's free ticket (except if you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), these concert visitors need to prepare some tasks, or αtination - like being a volunteer, sending e-mail to world leaders, making phone calls or any other meaningful way to help increase awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
How far - reaching would the world’s success have been in the 12 - year - olds back then?
>>zsm_Latn<< Is the idea of giving a free concert a sincere way of urging people to demand an action, or just one more case-clickivism - making someone feel they have done something by simply signing one petition online or by sending a petition?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said they've encoded as many as 19 million — an explosion from its supporters, urging movement with different goals.
>>zsm_Latn<< They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and fundamentals worth more than $37 billion that would bring about change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
>>zsm_Latn<< By the beginning of 2018, the group had identified to be 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, and at least $10 billion of that number had already been either overcrowded or collected.
The same group had estimated that those funds would have affected almost 649 million people around the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some important committees include Food Powers, a sharing between growers and sustainable implements in the UK that are committeeed to \"help children attain their full potential\" - promising to contribute $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate unbalanced eating in that area after receiving more than 4,700 cooking than Gobal Citizens.
- With the support of the UK government, the donors, the coalition government and Global Citizens like yourself, we can make this unequal social injustice of eating a past story in the history, - says the World Power of Eating Tracey Ullman when a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said after receiving over 5,000 calls for the UK to improve food for mothers and children, the government has found to finance a project, Food Power, which will now reach 5 million women and children who need it.
Answering one of Lazim's questions on his website asking why you think we can end poverty.
The Global Citizen replied: ‘ This is a difficult path and will take times when we will get discouraged and give up.
But just as the movement demands public rights and anti-antipartheids before, we will succeed, because the more we work together, the stronger we become.
>>zsm_Latn<< Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the same artists making this year's show in New York, which will be served by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the U.S. Navy as -agent to prevent Russia from exporting oil - The Secretary of State
>>zsm_Latn<< Washington was able - if necessary - using his Navy to prevent Russia from selling its oil on the market, including in the Middle East, said U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke according to Washington Examiner's report.
>>zsm_Latn<< Zinke accused Russia's occupation of Syria - as it is known, involving themselves at the invitation of the Syrian government - his supposedly seeking new oil markets.
- I believe their presence in the Central South is to control the oil supply as they have done in eastern Europe and in southern Europe, he says.
And according to the officer, there's a way to address this issue.
- The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure the seaways are open, and if necessary, to prevent their oil from being marketable, he said.
>>zsm_Latn<< Zinke said so when making a speech at an event Consumer Energy Alliance, a group was not based on a profit that was self-sustaining as the American oil user's voice.
>>zsm_Latn<< He also helped compare Washington's actions to Russia and Iran, and emphasized the same action.
>>zsm_Latn<< The economic choice over Iran and Russia is more or less the same, affecting and replacing oils, - he says, while referring to Russia as having no other choice and with his economy so dependent on oil.
>>zsm_Latn<< This reality was issued when Trump administration in a mission to increase the export of natural gas into much cheaper Europe to users in Europe, replacing Russia.
>>zsm_Latn<< As a result, Trump officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself tried to persuade the German state to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project next to - which according to Trump would make Berlin supported by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project worth $11 billion that would indicate the capacity of the available pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters and it was just an economic project.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Kremlin accused Washington of being so strong about this project was due to economic reasons and was an unfair example of competition.
- I'm sure we're in agreement that power supply cannot be made to press and users need to be free to vote - said Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Power, Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
>>zsm_Latn<< The U.S. act has invited the discontent of the German state, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.

>>zsm_Latn<< U.S. charged China ‘bulls' with ‘ propaganda advertising'
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four - page press release in the U.S. newspaper describing good - bye trade between the U.S.A., the U.S. Army to China accused China of using American newspapers to spread its propaganda.
>>zsm_Latn<< US President Donald Trump on Wednesday last referred to China Daily newspaper advertising in the newspaper Des Moines Register - the most widely sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China's country of attempting to interfere with a congressional election on November 6, an accusation denied by China.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump's charge that Beijing was trying to intervene in US elections explaining what U.S. officers reported to Reuters as a new phase in the campaign to suppress China's state.
>>zsm_Latn<< Being a common practice for foreign governments broadcasts to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now engaged in a increasingly poor trade war with each wearing fares over their imports.

Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor Iowa, China’s largest exporter of farm goods, said that the Beijng movement had caused much suffering to the American staff, farmers, and businesses.

>>zsm_Latn<< In publishing this proponent, the Chinese government received the freedoms practiced by the Americans, a tradition that put freedom of speech and freedom of newspapers first, wrote Branstad.

Ramirez also said that the Federal Court's candidate also showed his shame in front of Ford when a party he was demanding at Yale University around the 1980s.

>>zsm_Latn<< Some of them were angry because they stayed up all night to witness this resistance.
>>zsm_Latn<< One of the fans says the exchange to a child's cartoon channel - one of the jokes that doesn't smooth up - through its sparks.

- I think when I talk about the broadcast again, I think we can do something, says Coker.
‘But at six o'clock on Sunday we can't do anything until Sunday's our time, their Monday.
We're working on it.
>>zsm_Latn<< Believe it, when the broadcast is converted there is a lot of recitation and it is not all worth listening.
We're trying to deal with this problem, we think this is a technical problem.
>>zsm_Latn<< But no, this is more to the issue relating to the government.
I promise these things won't happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five resistance instead of six - as usual - and we're trying to do something that could not be done for the fans.

He's 24-year-old doesn't realize anything until he goes to high school and doesn't feel everyone like me--
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, he talked about gay rights to give - hope to others.

He said: \"To this day, feelings less than others and a different feeling are things that have motivated me and gave me the strength to succeed--
He wants to prove that he's--that's his word, so he doesn't disappoint anyone when they get to know about his sexuality.
>>zsm_Latn<< This two-time Olympic sports bronze medal winner is now a high-profile campaigner for the LBGT group and has used its appearance in the Komanwel Sports in Australia this year so that more countries no longer make homosexuality a crime.
He said he spoke this because he felt lucky that he could live openly without any problem and want to give - hope to others like him.

Mickelson isn't so ready to face Ryder Cup on Saturday this will be awake
American player Phil Mickelson will create a new record on Sunday when he plays for 47 times in the Ryder Cup game, but he needs to be willing to compensate for the game's achievements so that it doesn't end with grief.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mickelson who will play in this year's event for a record 12 times, has been warned by captain Jim Furyk for the game -fourballs » and -foursomes - on Saturday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Behind being a focus as usual for the United States, the winners of these five major games spend time as soccerrs and practice in hopes of improving the game.
>>zsm_Latn<< A person who can't hit the ball straight even when at the top of his game, this 48-year player is not the right choice for the Le Golf National golf field, where the distance is very difficult for a hit that does not keep the target.
And if this golf field is just boring, Mickelson in the ninth battle this Sunday will connect with the British Open Winner, Francesco Molinari who has joined Tommy Fleetwood's new arrival to win all four matches this week.
>>zsm_Latn<< If the American player, the missing four eyes start with 12 private games, starting with a fierce start, then the Mickelson game is certainly very important.
Furyk is so sure of his players, that's all he can say.
- He understood his role today, and put his shoulders and hands on my shoulders and said he would be ready to go tomorrow, - said Furyk.
- His self - confidence is immense.
>>zsm_Latn<< He has been famous and has contributed a lot of services to this army since, and this week.
>>zsm_Latn<< I might not have imagined that he would play in two games.
I imagine more than that, but that's how we think we should do it.
He wants to be the same, like everyone.
Mickelson will address Nick Faldo's record of the most occurrence in the Ryder Cup on this Sunday.
This is probably the last time he will join the Ryder Cup that never compares to his personal record achievement.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost 20 times and seven series, even though Furyk said his presence brought a spark to his troops.
- He's funny, he likes jokes, he likes to wear people and it's fun if he's in the army room, he says.
- I think all young players have fun with him, this week, and it's fun to see him.
More than that, though, he played a part.
>>zsm_Latn<< European troops Thomas Bjorn knew their positions ahead of them would soon be lost
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knew from his experience that the far ahead of him could be lost on the last day of Ryder's Cup and made things worse.
>>zsm_Latn<< This Danish player first joined the 1997 game in Valderrrama, where the Sever Ballesteros drove as captain and preceded American troops with 5 eyes but was only able to win very thin once with an eye count of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
>>zsm_Latn<< —You keep reminding yourself after the position ahead of Valderrama; we also get a position ahead of Brookline but we lose and in Valderram we win, but win thinly, - said Bjorn after seeing Class 2018 winning 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to be in front with a 10-6 eye count at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in that team that this game isn't over yet.
We're fighting out tomorrow.
>>zsm_Latn<< Get out and play seriously and don't make mistakes.
>>zsm_Latn<< This has not ended as long as the eyes have not been muffled and are placed on the rayboard.
We had the goal of winning the trophies, and we focused on that goal.
I told you, I'm going to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we all have to realize who's against us - they're the greatest players in the world.
So happy to see his men in the golf field that is so difficult, Bjorn adds: - I can't be bold.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow an individual's achievement needs to be noticed and that's something different to do.
It's a great thing to be out there with a friend and when everything goes smoothly but when you're alone then your full capacity as a golfer will be tested.
This is a message that all players need to hear, give you your best tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he needs to give him the best in him too.
>>zsm_Latn<< Contrary to Bjorn's view, his opponent Jim Furyk would expect his player to play well as an individual player compared to the kissing event, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to get three eyes from four eyes.
>>zsm_Latn<< Furyk himself had an experience on the last day where the position changed, when it was in the army that was winning at Brookline before losing a surprise when the European army was doing - Miracles in Medicah -
- I still remember every break of words, - he said when answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999 burned the player's spirit on the last day.
We have 12 more events tomorrow, but if you all want to start it as fast as you can see at Brookline, as you can see in Medina.
When the momentum starts, it will put pressure on the event in the middle.
We're going to pry our players into a game that we think is appropriate, we're going to try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned to fight back and connect with Rory McIlroy at the main event, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter of European players who were at the top of the first part.
- I made this rule because I think it's going to be good and it's all over, says Bjorn about the individual player's choice.
The new German warship was delayed
The German navy had to accept its latest ordeal in 2014 to replace the warships of the Cold War, but it was not going to be prepared until the next year for increasing damage to the system and the cost, according to local media reports.
>>zsm_Latn<< The maintenance of the warship —Rhineland-Pfalz — the first ship under the Baden-Weerttemberg-class crisis has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit who quoted the military spokesman.
It was not until 2014 that the ship was supposed to join the navy, and it was not easy for some of the nation’s older brothers to cross this huge project.
>>zsm_Latn<< The four warships of Baden-Weerttemberg-class fragility built by the Navy in 2007 would replace the Bremen-class difficulties.
As meaningful as it is, it will contain features such as high-powered cannons, a variety of flight and antitactic and some features of deviance as reducing the detection of radar, red light and acaustic abilities.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance time distance - this recent challenge must be able to navigate up to two years than its base.
However, various obstacles to this advanced warship said to have been able to highlight Germany’s foreign powers - the passage of time leading up to the time of this ship joining the naval service, according to Die Zeit
This unfortunate F125 crisis became the headline last year when German Navy officials refused to upgrade the battleship and return it to the Blohm & Voss company in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to its owners after the delivery.
Not much is known why the ship was returned, but the German newspaper called some of the damage - and devices - making this warship useless if sent to the battle mission.
>>zsm_Latn<< The damage to software needs to be taken heavy because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warship will be controlled by only 120 classes - half of what is needed to control the old Bremen class's difficulties.
Timbul also matters where the battleship is too heavy and this will reduce achievement and limit the ability of the Navy to make any future improvement.
>>zsm_Latn<< —Rheinland-Pfalz - 7,000-tan was believed twice as much as the warship in the same class that the German army had used during World War II.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to the damage to the device, the overall cost of the project - including the training for the grade - is also an issue.
The project is said to have broken down €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - more than the original price of €2.2 billion Euros.
The problem with the latest warplanes reveals how far the German navy had gone.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee in the parliament, admitted that the navy did have a problem with the lack of usable warships.
The officer in charge said that the issue was getting worse by not having the old warship stopped.
He complained that not one of the hardships of Baden-Weerttemberg-class could join the Navy.
National Trust deposited the life of the bat
>>zsm_Latn<< The latest research being conducted at an att in the Scottish highlands aims to explain why bats use the face shape of the earth to hunt for food.
It is hoped that this study will lead to the latest discoveries involving the unique behavior of mammals that attempt to fly and provide guidance for conservation activities.
>>zsm_Latn<< A study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland would follow the usual bat, and soprano pedestrelles bat as well as long-winged brown bat and Daabenton bat in Inverwe Park in Wester Ross.
>>zsm_Latn<< A special recorder will be placed in certain locations around the estate to track bat activity throughout the season.
>>zsm_Latn<< The NHS and volunteers will also make moving reviews using easy tracking tools.
>>zsm_Latn<< The player analyzes the sound of all recordings will determine the frequency of each kind of bat and its species and the practice of this bat.
A map of the habitat and a report will be produced to create an image of the earth’s surface with respect to bat behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser to the NTS, hopes this decision will show the most important habitat area to the bat and how it is used by every bat species.
>>zsm_Latn<< This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management such as making forests and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
>>zsm_Latn<< The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined a lot since the last century.
>>zsm_Latn<< The bat is threatened as a result of building and construction work that disrupts the nesting area to the point and loss of habitats.
>>zsm_Latn<< Wind turbines and lights are also a risk to bats the same as fly trap paper and some chemicals used to care for building materials as well as pet cats attacks.
Actually, the bat isn't blind.
>>zsm_Latn<< Because the bat hunts at night then their ears are more useful than their eyes.
>>zsm_Latn<< They use location detection techniques using sound to identify the position of insects and obstacles while in flight.
The NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, has 38 important parks and 7,6,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land across the country, and has a special interest in bats.
>>zsm_Latn<< They have ten trained experts who often run a review, check up and sometimes save a bat.
The organization has also implemented one of the first bat - protection centers in Scotland in the Threave agate in Dumfries and Galloway, a place where eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland live.
>>zsm_Latn<< David Thompson the aesthetic manager said this aesthetic is the most appropriate place for the bat.
- In Thereave we have an ideal place for bats, he says.
- We've got an old building, a lot of big trees and suitable habitats.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many more we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to live and develop.
He stressed how important it is to run a check before the maintenance work in the property because there is a possibility that we can accidentally destroy a bat nest that will contain bat children where this is capable of killing 400 female bats and bat children, and may destroy the entire local bat population.
>>zsm_Latn<< The bat is protected and is a mistake to kill, persecute or disrupt or destroy nested bat's place.
Elisabeth Ferrrell, an officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: 'There's still a lot we need to learn about bats and for many of our species don't know how their populations thrive--
Ronaldo denied the charges of rape while his lawyer was preparing to secure the German magazine.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Christian Ronaldo said the charge of smuggling upon himself as a false news story - and said there was someone to \"promotes themselves\" by using his name.
>>zsm_Latn<< His lawyer was to seal the German magazine Der Spiegel who published the charges of this accusation.
The Portuguese and Juventus, an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, were accused of rape in a 2009 hotel room in Las Vegas.
Later, he was told that he had paid $375,000 to close the mouths of the victims to the report of Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in the Instagram Live video to 142 million of his followers a few hours after this report was reported, Ronaldo 33 years threatened this report as a \"false news news\"
- Not at all.
>>zsm_Latn<< What they say today is a false news, - the winner's 5 award Ballon d'Or to the camera.
- They want to promote themselves by using my name.
Mistake.
They want to be famous by calling me, this is part of my work.
I was happy, and it was all beautiful, ” she says with a smile.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ronaldo lawyers are preparing to inform De Spiegel on this charge, which they call - a report that is unsustainable and disturbing private space, according to Reuters.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Christian Schertz lawyer said the player would demand a reprieve for - a moral breakdown that directly interfered with his personality, which may have been one of the most serious personal rights violations since some years ago--
>>zsm_Latn<< This incident was reported in June 2009 at a luxury hotel Palms and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back to the player’s hotel room, where he was accused of visiting the woman without the truth, according to a draft paper registered in Clark’s State Court in Nevada.
>>zsm_Latn<< Major accused the player of kneeling in front of him and said that he -99 percent - was a good man - and was only suffocated because - one-percent-
>>zsm_Latn<< The document confirmed Ronaldo claimed to have sex, but on the basis of common liking.
>>zsm_Latn<< Majorga also accused him of making a police report and taking a picture of the injuries that occurred when he was in the hospital, but later agreed to settle him outside of the court because he'd be afraid of a response - and was afraid of what - was being mugged by the generals-
The 34 - year - old woman, who is now in her mid - 30 ’ s, is trying to undo the past because she still experiences what has happened.
Ronaldo almost joined the Real Madrid from Manchester when this accusation occurred, and this summer he has moved to the Italian football giant Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will be sorry forever' for losing a car'
>>zsm_Latn<< UK - will be sorry for ever - if the loss of status as world leader in the post Brexit train spending, says Greg Clark Trade Secretary.
He adds this to a little bit of interest because Toyota UK told the BBC that Britain left Europe's Union without a solution, he would stop spending his own car in Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
We need a solution, says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car executive said the effect of this would result in a transmission problem on the border if there was no solution to Brexit and this would lead to the loss of a job.
>>zsm_Latn<< The factory in Burnaston - which released the Toyota Auris and Avensis - installed nearly 150,000 units of cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
- I think that if Britain came out of the European Union without a solution at the end of March, we would stop the car spending in our factory, says Marvin Cooke, head of Toyota affairs in Burnaston.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some other motorists in the UK include, Honda, BMW, and Jaguar and Land Rover share their concerns if the UK exits the European Union without settlement regarding how border hack trade will work.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, BMW said they would close their Mini car factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
>>zsm_Latn<< The main concern of car issuers is about the risk of a supply network if Brexit does not exist with any solution.
Toyota car expenditures depend on the installation base based on the receiving of supplies at the right time without having to be stored with the rest of the car being taken into the factory every 37 minutes from the rest of the UK and the European Union for the cars being installed.
>>zsm_Latn<< If the UK exits the European Union without any solution on March 29, it is likely that there will be chaos at the border that industrial players predict will happen to delay and lack of replaced materials.
>>zsm_Latn<< Toyota cannot possibly store inventory supplies more than a day in Derbyshire factory, said the company concerning, then spending will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the future plan of the Minister of Finance Theresa May against the two-way connection with the European Union - needs to d do with the precise to avoid any examinations on the border--
We need a solution, we want a solution that will allow not just success for the present but for us to say this opportunity, - he said to BBC in Radio 4's Today programme.
- Openning not only from Toyota but also from other sources shows that we must continue this highly successful supply network
>>zsm_Latn<< Toyota cannot say how long the expenditure will be stopped, but for a long period of warning will increase the cost and reduce the power of this factory and so on will result in a loss of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the labor union responsible for the management of the union in this factory, says the unionists are already beginning to worry: ← By my experience, the lost job will never come back.
A government spokesman said: ‘ We have presented a proper and secure plan for future relations between us and the European Union.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, said the White House
>>zsm_Latn<< The most important meeting between Donald Trump with the reward of the defendant Rod Rosenstein was probably-rejected to the next week - due to the discussion of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as the candidate of the continuing union court, according to the White House on Sunday.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rosenstein who oversees the work of the special lawyer Robert Mueller linked Russian intervention in elections, the relationship between Trump's and Russia's helpers and the possibility of preventing justice by the President.
>>zsm_Latn<< Whether Trump would have fired the reward of the prosecution or not and then interfered with Mueller's freedom to continue the investigation had become the warmest gossip in Washington.
Early this month, the New York Times newspaper reported that Rosenstein was planning on using a secret recorder to record his conversation with Trump and was likely to replace the president by using a 25th fine.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, behind the report saying he was going to quit his job.
>>zsm_Latn<< Instead announced one meeting on Thursday with Trump which at the time was in the United Nations in New York.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump said he/she's not willing to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid him connected with the recognition of Kavanaugh and Dr Christine Blassey Ford one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of violating him, in front of the Senate's justice committee, both of whom they gave recognition.
>>zsm_Latn<< On Friday, Trump directed the FBI to conduct an investigation for a week to the charge against Kavanaugh, this had suspended another full adjourn in the Senate.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared in Fox news on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: ‘It's not yet set up yet, maybe this week, I think it might be suspended another week because some of the things that are happening in the court of the alliance.
Let's see later and I'll always give the press updates.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some newscasters will dispute it: Sanders has never held any white House press meetings since September 10.
>>zsm_Latn<< When the host asks why.
Sanders said he didn't hold many newspapers, not because he disliked the TV show who was trying to find out, but also saying: \"I don't agree that they really wanted attention\"
>>zsm_Latn<< Then he says the connection between the press and Trump will increase.
>>zsm_Latn<< —President has held the most controversial session than the pre-presidents before him, - he says without providing any evidence. —We have made the calculations--
The newspapers will remain held, says Sanders, but if the news media have a chance to ask the president of the United States, that would be better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen us do so a lot since the last week, and this will replace the press congregation when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump frequently answered questions from the press when traveling outside the White House or when parting in an open - hearing session or when conducting a public talk with a distinguished guest.
>>zsm_Latn<< The media congregations individually are very rare.
>>zsm_Latn<< This week in New York, the president showed why he sometimes made a free and strange appearance before the assembled reporter.
The health secretary wrote to European Union workers in the NHS regarding their concerns to Brexit
The secretary of the convention had written a letter to all the workers from the European Union who worked in the NHS Scotland to express gratitude to the country and hoped they would continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a warrant for about six months before the UK leaves the European Union.
The Scottish government also issued a committee committee applying for European citizens who were working in its public sector.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: . During the summer, concerns between the UK and the European Union about resignation have continued, and are headed to reach the decision towards the fall of the fall.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the UK government has improved the preparation to face a scenario without completion.
I know this is something that bothers you all.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contributions of each of you, without counting your nationality.
Fellow workers from all over the European Union and other countries, bringing with them many experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and community we treat.
Scotland is where you all live and we want you all to stay here.
>>zsm_Latn<< Abercrombie Passes Emergency Surgery After Experience of Injury on Head
>>zsm_Latn<< Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after a head injury after 31-27 loss with Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessean.
>>zsm_Latn<< Leader of coach Rod Reed told the injured announcers that had occurred just before the second half time.
>>zsm_Latn<< -He closes the edge line and suddenly breaks there, » says Reed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Trainers and health officials gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting him in the council and taking him for further treatment.
An official from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds - there's no information about the type/how far his injury is at this time - and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury happens.

He's done five hopes on Saturday before getting out of the game, the number of those expected this season is 18.
Foreign buyers will be put on a higher seal when they buy property in the UK
>>zsm_Latn<< Foreign buyers will be subjected to higher sealies when they buy property in the UK and this waste of money will be used to help with the block under Tory's latest plans.
>>zsm_Latn<< This step will validate Corbyn's success to attract the young voter
>>zsm_Latn<< This union will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
>>zsm_Latn<< Expected budgets can quote up to £120 million a year - to help with blockage
Foreign buyers will be put to a higher termite when they buy property in the UK - money than this will be used to help with blockage, says Theresa May today.
This seemed like a stepping - stone to Jeremy Corbyn’s success in drawing the young vote with the promise of providing the best housing available and making the highly regarded one a target.
>>zsm_Latn<< The increase in the system will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, the money from this result will help the government to address the problem of homeless people.
>>zsm_Latn<< This addition - is an addition to the previously worn seali of the table including the higher dues that have been introduced two years ago to the top of the second house and the house purchased for rent that may be three percent worn.
>>zsm_Latn<< The treasury was expected to be able to collect up to £120 million a year through this step.
>>zsm_Latn<< Estimated 13 percent of London's new estates are purchased by those who are not UK citizens, causing prices to rise and make it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Most affluent areas - especially in the mothers - have been hysterical - since many of the owners are foreign owners who spend much of their time abroad.
This new site was announced a few weeks after Boris Johan demanded that the system be reduced so that more young people could buy their first home.
He accused the huge construction company of permanently maintaining a high estate price by buying land but not waking it up, and he asked Mrs May to remove the quotas to the home that could be in order to address the embarrassing housing issue — Britain.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mr. Corbyn has announced some of the interesting housing restoration reserves series, including rent control and draining out the evacuation - innocent
He also wanted to have more authority given to the councillors to build a new house.
Mrs. May said: ‘Last time I said I would dedicate my time as prime minister to restore British dreams - this life must be better for every future generation.
And that means fixing our poor housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to stay, work, and build up a comfortable life here.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, it is unfair because it is very easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as a firm abroad to buy homes compared to the British working hard here.
To make matters worse, the dream of owning a house may be very remote, and it is only natural to live in a place where shame is common.
Jack Ross: ‘My main goal is to take care of Scotland'
>>zsm_Latn<< Sunderland Jack Rosa's boss said--the main goal is that he is to be a Scottish manager one time later.
The 42-year-old Scottish people were looking forward to the challenge of repurchasing the North-East club that was on the third floor of the League of One, less than three eyes from the top.
>>zsm_Latn<< He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the former Scottish Prime Minister League.
- I want to represent the country as a player.
>>zsm_Latn<< I got a call for B stamp and so far, - said Ross to BBC Scotland Sportsound.
- I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when he was a child, and something kept drawing me there.
The chance will only come, if I succeed as the club manager.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ross's successor as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athetic said he didn't feel that khuathhir followed a trail of so well-known names in the big clubs, because he had previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich Town's proposal.
- For me the point of success at this time was ‘ Can I bring this club back into the League of Prime Ministers?
>>zsm_Latn<< Because of the structure and ease that exists in this club, it is certainly supposed to be in the League of the Primes, - he said.
- That's not easy to achieve, but I'll think I'll succeed if I can get this club back into the League of Prime Ministers--
Ross was just three years in management, after being a manager in Dumbarton and being a coach in Hearts' for 15 months.
>>zsm_Latn<< He later helped Alloa back to the third stage after being handed down and changing St Mirren's fate rather than being sent down to become a Champion in the following season.
>>zsm_Latn<< And says Ross, he is more comfortable now than when he became a player in Clyde, Hartletool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
- It's an option, she remembers, when it takes care of Alloa.
- I know that management really matches me, rather than playing.
It may sound strange because I succeed, I can enjoy a good life, and I can enjoy some interesting moments.
Playing that is a bit difficult.
There's a lot of things you need to go through every week.
I still went through it under pressure and under pressure to do secular work, but as a manager, I felt much better.
>>zsm_Latn<< I always want to take care of and now I am doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something I like all my adult life -

>>zsm_Latn<< The mother's milking advertisement that makes comparisons with the cow brings conflicting opinions online
A nursing mother’s milking company found that she had many conflicting opinions over the Internet because of their advertising that compared the mother sucks with the milk she has given to milk.
>>zsm_Latn<< To launch what the silent and usable mother's milk--the world's first user technology company Elvie released a joke-shaped music video to show the freedom that mothers can enjoy using this new pam.
>>zsm_Latn<< Four mother dances in a cow's barn filled with straw to the song where her lyrics are saying: \"Yes, I'm my own milk pam, but you can't see any tail-and-if you don't realize this isn't a white, it's my chest--
>>zsm_Latn<< The colusus is: ¿Pam out, pamma out, I'm sucking the kids, pam out, pam out, I'm my chest pam--
>>zsm_Latn<< However, this advertisement published on this firm's Facebook page has caused online controversy.
>>zsm_Latn<< With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, this video has invited a variety of reactions from the public, many who say it gives a picture of the excitement about the instigating industry - excited
- An unwise decision to use a bull to advertise the product.
>>zsm_Latn<< Just as we do, cows need to be milked and have to bear a baby to produce milk, but unfortunately the calf is separated from the cow's mother within a few days of their birth, a writer says.
>>zsm_Latn<< Elvie's milk pam can be fully inserted into a secret mixing coli (Elvie/Mother)
>>zsm_Latn<< Another commented: -Amongnys one trauma for cows and calves.
- But what did they use to advertise milk for mothers who could keep their children?
>>zsm_Latn<< Another adds: - An advertisement that doesn't have to make direct use of -
>>zsm_Latn<< The other person defends the advertisement, with a woman claiming that she finds the song really amusing-
- I think this is a genius idea.
I'll buy one if I still give the body milk.
It makes me feel exactly like a cow.
That was a bit crazy, but I thought it was the one shown.
This is a genius product, a writer.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another commented: \"This is an amusing advertisement addressed to a pregnant mother (often on the job or on the toilet) and feels like-the-female
>>zsm_Latn<< This is not an advertising that commends or assesses the industry of the insungu--
>>zsm_Latn<< At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that all of them had been dancing with pamots hidden in their inner clothes.
The idea behind the scenes is based on the fact that most women who give milk say they feel like a cow.
However, Pam Elvie is completely quiet, has no wire or tube and can be loaded secretly in the clothes in the milk, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and also out while embosing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and an ECD in Mother commented: \"Pam Elvie is such a revolutionary product, it should have received a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the women who feed with milk cows, we want to put the body’s milk cover and all the challenges associated with it as the main focus, showing a way to comfort and connect the hook with free feelings through the use of a new pam.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is not the first time Elvie pumps become the headlines.
During the London Festival Sunday, a mother of two children appeared on the platform for Marta Jakubowski, using the product.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hundreds of Child-Shifts Move Swim to Camp in Texas Borders
>>zsm_Latn<< The number of detained migrants increased even though the transfer of the monthly border did not change much, due to the rhetorical and weight base identified by Trump administration, making children's placement with assurances increasingly difficult.
By tradition, assuranceers are undocumented guests, and they are afraid to jeopardize their position to stay in the country if they take a child.
The risk increased in June, when the authorities announced that an insurance policy and other family members had to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
>>zsm_Latn<< Last week, Matthew Albence, the right minister of the Imgressen and Power of Kasam, testified in front of Congress that the agency had prevented dozens of individuals who had pleaded to be a guarantee to the unwary children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous record of crimes.
- Close to 80 percent of the individuals who are either an insurance officer or a family member, are here illegally and most of them come without permission.
>>zsm_Latn<< That way we will continue to hunt the individual, - says Albance.
To process children more quickly, the authorities identify new regulations that require some of them to attend court within a month of detention, not after 60 days according to the previous standards, according to the protection workers.
Many will attend by means of a call from the video congregation, rather than on a personal basis, to appeal to their case so that they can be accepted in front of an immigrate judge.
>>zsm_Latn<< Those considered unworthy for help will be deported immediately.
>>zsm_Latn<< The longer the children under the prisoner, they will be more likely to become anxious or depressed, and this will lead to the actions of the bear or the attempt to escape, following the protection officers and following reports issued by the system in recent months.
Supporters said that the fear is higher in a larger facility like Tornillo, where the sign that children struggle with feelings may not be detected, because of the size of the place.
>>zsm_Latn<< They added that by moving children to camp cities without providing time for them to be emotionally prepared, or saying goodbye to friends might make worse the trauma they face.
Syria to the U.S. troops, France and Turkey retreat immediately
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, urged Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in the country had reached the eighth year.
Kikulem, who also received the prime minister's salary, said foreign troops in Syria's land under the snare of fighting violence committed by his rivals
- They should step back immediately and without a requirement, he tells the trial.
Maikulem confirms that the war against violence has ended in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have lost their homes.

>>zsm_Latn<< The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, specifically for training and counseling Kurdish and Arab Syrian troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 armies on earth.
>>zsm_Latn<< Regarding the refugee problem, Mukalem says, the situation is appropriate for them to return, and he accuses - a number of outside countries - which promotes irrational fear - which causes the escape not to return.
- We have called international community and humanitarian organizations to help with this return, he said.
>>zsm_Latn<< - They are politicizing things that are supposed to be the problem of humanity alone--
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not be restored until a political treaty formed between Assad and the rebels was fought to end the war.
Diplomat PB says that the treaty between Russia and Turkey to provide military free zones in areas dominated by the Idlib rebels created an opportunity to continue political assault.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Russian-Turki conversation has shifted a major attack by the Russian-supported Syrian army in a region where three million people live.
>>zsm_Latn<< Bakulem however asserting, the treaty had the real-time limit - and expected military action to subjugate the jihad including the rebels of Nusra Front associated with Al Qaeda, which would have been abolished -
A special UN initiative, Staffan de Mistura hopes to set up the first meeting for new committees, which contain government and government personnel to spare post-war mining and open the way for elections.
Mukulem stated the conditions of the Syrian government's inclusion in the committee, saying that the panel work should be restricted to the--checking the current institutional article, and warning of interference.

>>zsm_Latn<< External money flooded into the fierce competition of the mid-election Council
It is not surprising that the 17 Pennsylvania elections showed a flood of money, since reconstitution of congressional areas showed two visitors now competing for the same seat.
>>zsm_Latn<< The substandard Pittsburgh area redraws the representative Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his chair in the typical election of the previous spring.
Lamb competed against other present - day visitors, Republican representative Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th Pennyslvania area, which corresponds to 17 new ones.
The map was redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas had been conquered by Republicans.
A recent 17th - century match was started between the main financial officer of the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a commonly heard name in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in the Mac's special election for the 18th Congress region of Pennyslvania that is widely watched.
>>zsm_Latn<< The chair had been won by Republican for secad, and President Donald Trump won the area with 20 eyes.

>>zsm_Latn<< The diplomats of the Dominican and Panama Republic have recognized Beijing, with little negative response than Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until my partner took off the Trump Organization management team.
Government officials decided to call back the head of American diplomatic representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama due to the current decision not to recognize Taiwan, ← Heather Nauert, the chairman of the department said in the beginning of this month.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the fines were only imposed on El Salvador, who received $140 million budgets in the form of American aid in 2017, including narcotic control and economic support.
>>zsm_Latn<< The proposed fine, including a piece to the financial assistance and limitations of the intended visa, will have a negative effect on the Central American country with a high unemployment rate and murder.
>>zsm_Latn<< After an internal meeting, North American and Central American officials suspended a high-level trial focusing on the safety and prosperity of the economy, for a similar meeting last year that seemed to be a positive step in preventing visitors from heading to the United States.
But in mid - September, the top government officials decided that they wanted the trial to continue, effectively stopping any considerations that would lead to El Salvador.
>>zsm_Latn<< President Mike Pence's reward will now give a speech in the trial, scheduled in mid-October, as a sign of the administration's import at the meeting, according to the diplomat.
>>zsm_Latn<< And the three American representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no strong messages or fines from Washington.
>>zsm_Latn<< White House spokesman for Bolton refused to review the debate details described by the three American officers, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations with the terms of inattention.
Their descriptions are supported by external analysts who are closely associated with administration and who also speak with the terms of inconsequentiality.
>>zsm_Latn<< History Studies
What will happen next may be a report of Robert Mueller's typical lawyer on the possibility of a possible violation of justice by Thamp, where there is now solid evidence in the general record.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mueller will also pose an investigation to investigate whether Trump's campaign has joined Russia in an attack on our election.
If the congress turns hands, Trump will face accountability on the party, as soon as he is ready to face the voter, and perhaps eventually the jury with his associate.
This is all if, and I don't say that Trump's fall must happen - or someone like him in Europe.
There are choices that all of us have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long this fight is.

>>zsm_Latn<< Historical travel surrounds such inflection points, and uncontaminated democratic travel will be facilitated or suspended.
>>zsm_Latn<< Americans faced some of these inflection points now.
What are we going to do if Trump fired Rod Rosenstein, a man who controlled Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has had a problem since this newspaper reported that, last year, she had planned to make a recording of the president and speculated that the president was not qualified for the office.
Rosenstein said the statement The Times was incorrect.
- How will we act if a new request for the FBI's investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unjust - or if he is authorized to the Agong Court even if there is a real charge of sexual assault and evidence of fraud?
And more importantly, are we going to vote for an issue of Congress on which Trump will be held accountable?
>>zsm_Latn<< If we fail in the test, democracy will go through a long winter.

Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against Austria, following the series with Spain against the early Villarreal of this month, would put them in a solid position to qualify for them in the G group in the European League.
>>zsm_Latn<< The injury on the knees prevented Graham Dorrans' middle player from making his advance appearance this season until a 2-2 series with Villarreal, but he believed Rangers used this decision as a stepping stone for a great victory.
- It's a good point because Villarreal is a good team, the 31-year-old player said.

We may win at the end of the fight, but the series may be more efficient.
>>zsm_Latn<< They may play better in the first middle and we play better in the second and in the better side.

>>zsm_Latn<< With the Tory Parliamentary, NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable for running Brexit's competition
Nigel Farage promises to 'move the army of the people' today in opposition at Tory's trial.
Former Ukip chief said, politicians need to 'feel deeply' from ‘Eurosceptics' - because one of the Parliament's members Theresa May, suggests he should be given the responsibility of controlling the negotiations with the EU.
>>zsm_Latn<< Peter Bone's Conservative parliamentary representative told the blast at Birmingham that the UK would 'out now' if Farage became Brexit' secretary.
The challenge, however, was that the struggle between members of the Remain Tories movement that joined the resistance to Brexit in the city was resolved.
>>zsm_Latn<< The prime minister was trying to ensure plans to avoid Chequers' insurance remained in execution in the middle of the attack rather than Brexiteer, Remain and the EU.
>>zsm_Latn<< The allied May run a dialogue with Brussels despite the impressions encountered - and the power of Euroscetic and Labour to choose between his package or 'cacacau-bill'.
>>zsm_Latn<< Bone tells the Outcoming is meaningful to exit at Solihull who wants to 'remove Chequers'.
He suggested that Farage be made a lord and was given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
'If he's given that responsibility, we're out now,' he said.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Wellingborough Parliament added: 'I support Brexit but we must remove Chequers.'
>>zsm_Latn<< Setting up an objection to the EU, he said, 'We are not fighting in the war of the world to be slaves.
>>zsm_Latn<< We want to make the law ourselves in their own country.'
Bone rejects the suggestion that public opinion has changed since 2016: 'The idea that British people have changed their minds and wanted to remain isn't right at all.'
>>zsm_Latn<< Brexit Tory's advocate, Andrea Jenkyns who also followed the blast, told reporters: 'I just said: Prime Minister, listen to the public's voice.
'Chequers aren't popular among public strangers, your commander will not vote in support, it's not popular in our party and the activities that are on the streets and that have voted on us.
>>zsm_Latn<< Please be nervous about Chequers and start listening.'
>>zsm_Latn<< In the message addressed to May, he added: 'The prime minister will continue to visit their services if they keep their promise.'
>>zsm_Latn<< Farage says politicians need to 'feel fuel' if they want to betray decisions made in 2016 referendum.
>>zsm_Latn<< 'This is a belief between us - the people - and the political class,' he says.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them 'we won't let them go without doing that.'
>>zsm_Latn<< In a message to the excited audience he adds: 'I want you to make our political class, which almost betrays Brexit, to feel its heat.
‘We're preparing the army of the people who gave us a victory in Bexit and won't rest until we made the United Kingdom free, own government, proud.'
>>zsm_Latn<< Meanwhile, Remainer marched through Birmingham before holding an assembly in the center of the city.
>>zsm_Latn<< A group of activists sent a horn Tories Against Brexit after the launch of the group at the end of the week.
>>zsm_Latn<< Peer Labour Lord Adonis scoffed at the Conservative about the safety issues they faced with the party application during the trial began.

There's no thing called Brexit good,' he added.

Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the world champion when the army ordered him to win, killed Sebastian Vettel
>>zsm_Latn<< It was clearly evident at the time, Valtteri Bottas set himself in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, - the command of Mercedes' troops played an important role in this race.
>>zsm_Latn<< From the beginning of the press, Bottas started well, nearly defeating Hamilton while defending his position on the first two rounds and taking Vettel to attack his fellow troops.
>>zsm_Latn<< Vettel enters the pit first and leaves Hamilton in the traffic on the end of the group, something that should be mutilated.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mercedes then entered the pit on the next round and exited behind Vettel, the Hamilton boot then made a sail action to the sail that made the Ferrai driver leave the inside of the risk of defending himself after the act of maintaining a third angle.
Max Verstapen starts from the rear grid and is in place to seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
>>zsm_Latn<< He then precedes most of the race and does not change the sail to broadcast quick reinforcement and intercept Kimi Raikconen for the fourth place.
>>zsm_Latn<< He entered the pit on a 44th round but could not increase the speed for the next eight rounds when Raikconen was in the fourth place.
It's a tough day for Valtteri who has made a good race over the weekend and a gentle man lets me slip.
>>zsm_Latn<< The army has done a good job of championing the first and second places, - said Hamilton.
That's not a good language.
>>zsm_Latn<< President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting on the urging of a woman he did not publish a letter rather than Christine Blasey Ford accusing the candidate of the Agong Brett Kavanaugh Court of sexual assault charges.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not give a direct answer to the testimony given before the Senate’s Justice Committee, but instead commented that what took place in the Senate showed the people — cruel and devious and liars —
- One thing that might have happened and the good things that happened just a few days ago in the Senate, when you saw anger, violence, and corruption, he said.
- When you look at the surgery and the leak and they say -oh, I don't do it.
I didn't do it--
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you leaking?
Remember the answer... did you publish the document -oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaking.
All right, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak, he added, by making that senator's face expression.
Feinstein was sent to report against Kavanughy Ford in July, and the letter was filed in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
- I don't keep Dr. Ford's charge, I don't publish his story, - Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
- He told me to keep it as hard and I kept it as hard as I was asked.
>>zsm_Latn<< But the denial of the woman was not the president's favorite, who gave the comment at the Saturday meeting: \"I tell you, it's an unpleasant language.
Maybe he didn't do that, but that's the worst language I've ever seen.
>>zsm_Latn<< Maintaining the candidate of the Agong Court, who had been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to achieve their own ends.
- They're determined to regain power in any way.
You see, cruelty, horror, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrificed to gain power and control, - Mediate reporting president said.

The future Brett Kavanaugh's depends on when the FBI started the investigation
- I think if we can get what he wants - a limited time inspection, a limited scope - we can bring to the unit, - said Fleke on Sunday, adding that the committee -kucar -kacir - in the pile based on a belief that has been rooted.
>>zsm_Latn<< Why did Kavanaugh and Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their refusal was due to the weather.
>>zsm_Latn<< Middle elections were only five more weeks away, and on November 6 - if as expected, Republican decisions were not satisfied, they would become weaker to get the person they wanted to appoint for the highest court in the country.

>>zsm_Latn<< What will happen after the FBI provides a report?
>>zsm_Latn<< The union will be run at the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are engaged.
It's not clear yet that Kavanaugh would get 50 votes from the Senate's chair, which would allow Mike Pence, the president's reward, equalizing the series and confirming his position in the Agong Court.

Pyongyang didn't give any public reviews.
Most of the North Korean invaders will be offered South Korea.
Seoul said that over 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which had the longest border with North Korea and it was easier to cross than the Army Free Zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
>>zsm_Latn<< China considers predators as illegal immigrants not as political escapes and often sends them back by force.
>>zsm_Latn<< The relationship between the North and the South - technically still goes to war - has improved since a few months ago.

- I believe if a woman behaves like that, they'll say the woman's 'emotion,' - follow the Pelosi on reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh with emotion denied the charge that he had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.

>>zsm_Latn<< He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling for charges against him (as well as defamation of a well-designed name-name) followed by liberals still angry Hilary Clinton was killed in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he was not qualified to hold a position in the Agong Court, because he showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
- I felt he had lost his own credentials and his actions against the Clintons and Democrats, - his followed.
>>zsm_Latn<< The party is reluctant when asked if he will try to charge Kavanaugh if he is authorized, and if Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
- I'm going to say this -- If he doesn't speak the truth to Congress and the FBI, he's not qualified to hold a position in the Agong Court, but only in the court he's now in, - said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was worried about Kavanaugh's decision to the Act of Preservation or Roe v. Wade, because he was bribed as a conservative court.
in a hearing of confirmation, Kavanaugh avoids answering whether he will change the judgment of the Agong Court.
- It's not the time for an emotional, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'happily,' - the end of the Pelosi.

She continues: - I'm helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who says she also cried when angry, but has created a technique, if she feels angry and starts crying, she will say to the person she spoke, ‘You may think I'm sad because I cried.
I'm getting mad.
Then he goes on.
And I feel that's a wise suggestion--
Spontaneity is defined as the way to let go of anger, since it is always misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of the old job, in a man - dominated office, I found myself crying with an uncontrollably sense of anger, being pulled by an older woman in the neck - a cold manager I was shivering into the stairs.
- Don't show them your tears, he tells me.
- They don't know that you're mad.
They think that you are sad and happy because you have made you sad
