>>zsm_Latn<< Interactive design requires the components of the project to be connected to each other, but it also makes sense as a separate entity.
>>zsm_Latn<< The lack of a magnifying lens lies in the fundamental complexity and the amount of lens elements required to get a focal length range much larger than the main lens.
>>zsm_Latn<< This becomes less problematic as the lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
>>zsm_Latn<< This allows the magnifying lens to produce an image with the same quality as that produced by the lens with a fixed focal distance.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another disadvantage of the zoom lens is the maximum (speed) opening of the lens is usually slower.
>>zsm_Latn<< This causes cheap lenses to be difficult to use in light less conditions without using flash lights.
>>zsm_Latn<< One of the most common problems when trying to convert movies to DVD formats is overscan.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most televisions are made to please the public in general.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, everything seen on TV has boundaries on the top, bottom, and side cut.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is done to ensure the image covers the entire screen.It is named overscan.
>>zsm_Latn<< Unfortunately, when you create a DVD, the edges section may be cut, and if there is text that is too down, then the text will be cut too.
>>zsm_Latn<< Traditional medieval castles have long inspired imaginations, bringing up a shadow of fighting groups riding with spears, dinners, and Arthurian knights.
>>zsm_Latn<< Even while standing in the midst of the ruins is thousands of years old, it is easy to imagine the sound and smell of battle in the past, until it is barely able to hear the sound of the horse's foundation striking the rock street and kiss the scent of fear that comes from the dungeon hole.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, is our imagination based on reality? First, for what castles are built? How are the castles designed and built?
>>zsm_Latn<< As typical of the period, the Kirby Muxloe Kastel was more like a fortified house than a real castle.
>>zsm_Latn<< His large glass window and its thin walls will not be able to withstand any further attack.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the 1480s, when its construction began by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defence was only required against a small group of surrounding robbers.
>>zsm_Latn<< A balance of power is a system that European countries are trying to maintain national sovereignty of all European countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< The concept is that all European countries should strive to prevent one country from being too strong, and therefore the national government often changes their alliances in order to maintain balance.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Spanish Translator War marked the first war with a central issue of the balance of power.
>>zsm_Latn<< This marked an important change, for the European powers would no longer have the pretext of becoming a religious war, thus the Thirty Years' War would be the last marked war as a religious war.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Artemis Temple in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 BC in the burning action performed by Herodotus.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to this story, his motivation is fame at the expense of anything.Ephasia's tribe that feels a gusar announces that Herostratus' name will never be recorded.
Later, Greek historian Strabo wrote about the name we know today, and the temple was destroyed on the same night as the birth of Alexander the Great.
>>zsm_Latn<< Alexander, as king, offered himself to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but his offer was rejected.After Alexander's fall, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.
>>zsm_Latn<< Make sure the hand in the syllic state may be while keeping pressing each tone properly - The finger effort does not make many extra moves.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this way, you will reduce your fatigue.Remember that there is no need to press tuts too hard to get extra volume as on the piano.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the accordion, to get the volume larger, you use a pubban with more pressure or speed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Misticism is a search for agreement, identity, or awareness of the highest reality, spiritual truth, divinity, or God.
>>zsm_Latn<< Search for direct experience, intuition, or insight into the reality of godship/gods or gods.
>>zsm_Latn<< Followers follow a certain way of life, or practice that develops the experience.
>>zsm_Latn<< Misticism can be known of other forms of worship and other religious beliefs by suppressing direct personal experience of unique state of consciousness, especially peaceful, happy, enlightened, or even cheerful.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sikhism is the religion of the Indian subcontinent. Sikhism comes from the Punjab region during the 15th century of sectarian divisions in Hindu tradition.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sikhs consider their beliefs different from Hinduism, though they also acknowledge their roots and traditions in Hinduism.
>>zsm_Latn<< ← Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, in Punjabi meaning - the teacher's course is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but Sikhism to a single interest that forms the core of Sikhism's beliefs--
>>zsm_Latn<< This area was found in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469â€1539). Followed by a succession of nine teachers.
>>zsm_Latn<< In June 1956, however, Krushchev's promise was tested during a riot in Poland, which is that workers protest food shortages and wage cuts, turning into a general protest against Communism.
>>zsm_Latn<< Even though in the end, Krushchev sent a tank to restore the state, he also gave way to some economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Gladyslaw Gomulka to become the new Prime Minister.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Indus Valley Civilization was a civilization in the Bronze Age located in the northwest Indian continent which includes most of present-day Pakistan and some areas in northwest India and northeastern Afghanistan.
>>zsm_Latn<< Civilization flourished in the basin of the Indus River, which was the origin of its name.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although some researchers speculate that civilization was also formed in the present dry Sarasvati river basin, the naming of the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization would be right, while others called it the Harappa Civilization, named after Harappa, which was its first excavation site in the 1920s.
>>zsm_Latn<< The militaryistic nature of the Roman empire contributed in the development of medical advances.
>>zsm_Latn<< Doctors began recruiting by the August Emperor and even formed the first Roman Medical Corps operating after the battle.
>>zsm_Latn<< The surgeon has knowledge of various tranquilizers including morphins of popi and scopolamine seeds extract from herban seeds.
>>zsm_Latn<< They became expert in amputation to save patients from gangren, as well as tornicket and arterial clema to contain blood flow.
>>zsm_Latn<< Over the centuries, the Roman empire had made rapid progress in medicine and created much of the knowledge we now know.
>>zsm_Latn<< Pure origami is origami with the limit of only one fold available at a time, not allowing more complicated folds such as flipping, and each fold has a grain location.
>>zsm_Latn<< It was developed by John Smith in 1970 to help inexperienced folding or who had limited motor abilities.
>>zsm_Latn<< Children develop awareness of race and racial stereotypes from childhood, and these racial stereotypes influence behavior.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, children of known minority races do not achieve in schools tend to fail after they learn about their racial stereotypes.
>>zsm_Latn<< MySpace is the third most popular site used in the United States with 54 million current profiles.
>>zsm_Latn<< These websites attract much attention, particularly in the realm of education.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are positive aspects of these websites, among other things, can easily prepare a classroom page that can be accompanied by blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
>>zsm_Latn<< This page can be easily accessed simply by providing one web address, which is easily remembered and easily typed by students who may have problems using a keyboard or with spelling.
>>zsm_Latn<< It can be adjusted so that it is easier to read and also more colors or less colors as desired.
>>zsm_Latn<< -Attention Deficit Disorder - is a neurologic syndrome that classically defines three series of symptoms, including impulsive, distracting, and hyperactive alias excess of energy -
>>zsm_Latn<< This is not an inability to learn, but a learning disorder; that is - affecting 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps about 2 million American children ]
>>zsm_Latn<< Children with ADD find it difficult to focus on things like school assignments, but can concentrate on things they like to do, e.g. playing a gym or watching a favorite cartoon, or writing a sentence without a punctuation.
>>zsm_Latn<< These children tend to get involved in many problems, as they've become involved in risky, combative behavior, and challenge the obligated of the parties - to stimulate their brains, as their brains cannot be stimulated in a usual way.
>>zsm_Latn<< ADD affects a person's relationships with other peers because other children cannot understand why sufferers act like that or why sufferers spell in their own way or the level of maturity is different.
>>zsm_Latn<< With the change in the ability to acquire knowledge and learn as mentioned above, the basic rate of knowledge is acquired as well.
>>zsm_Latn<< The approach to obtaining the information is different. its emphasis is no longer on individual memory, but the ability to remember the text.
>>zsm_Latn<< In essence, Renaissance created a significant change in approach to learning and the spread of science.
>>zsm_Latn<< Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move or hold loads or while resting on trees.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hands and legs of chimpanzees have similar size and length, reflecting the use of hands in holding the load while walking with the fingerbook.
>>zsm_Latn<< Man's hands are shorter than his feet, with a more straighthand span.
>>zsm_Latn<< A 2 million-year-old bone fossil shows this shift of hand specialization from thruster to drive.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some people believe that having many artificially induced conscious dreams can be quite often very tiring.
>>zsm_Latn<< The main cause of this phenomenon is the result of conscious dreaming increasing the duration between each REM state.
>>zsm_Latn<< With a REM less per night, the conditions as you are sleeping properly and as the body recovers so aren't so frequent that it causes a problem.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is just as tired as when you wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
>>zsm_Latn<< The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream conscious each night.
>>zsm_Latn<< The situation did not work well for Italians in North Africa were nearly aware of the beginning. Within a week since the Italian war statement on June 10, 1940, the 11th British Hussars had mastered the Capuzzo Fort in Libya.
>>zsm_Latn<< In an ambush on the east of Bardia, England captures the Chief Italian Tenth Army Engineer, General Lastucci.
>>zsm_Latn<< On June 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor General Libya and heir from Mussolini, was killed by his own party shot while landing at Tobruk.
>>zsm_Latn<< The strength that is a modern sport is matched at various levels, from students at the university to professional and Olympic competition.
>>zsm_Latn<< This exercise is generally played in the duel format, one power player is rolling with another player.
>>zsm_Latn<< Golf is a game that the player uses the beater to insert the ball into the hole.
>>zsm_Latn<< Eight holes were played during regular rounds, the players usually started in the first hole in the field and finished in the 18th hole.
>>zsm_Latn<< The winner is the player who does the punch or swing the least stick to finish the game.
>>zsm_Latn<< The game is played over the grass, and grass around the hole is cut shorter and called green.
>>zsm_Latn<< Perhaps the most common type of tourism is that most people associate with travel: Recreational resources.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is when a person goes somewhere very different from their birthday to relax and have fun.
>>zsm_Latn<< Beach, gardening, and camping places are often the most commonly visited by entertain tourists.
>>zsm_Latn<< If a person's goal to visit a place is to know his or her history and culture, then this type of tourism is also known by the name of cultural tourism.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tourists can visit a wide range of voices from a specific country or may simply choose to focus on one area alone.
>>zsm_Latn<< Seeing this activity, the Colonists also asked for help.
>>zsm_Latn<< The forces strengthened the future position including the first and third New Hampshire regiment of 200 people, under Colonel John Stark and James Reed (both later became general).
>>zsm_Latn<< Stark men took positions along the fence at the north end of the Colonial position.
>>zsm_Latn<< When the spring opened a gap along the Mystic River in the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north that ended on the water edge on the small coast.
>>zsm_Latn<< Gridley or Stark bet about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and orders no one to release the shot until it is regular past it.
>>zsm_Latn<< The American plan relied on launch of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
>>zsm_Latn<< General John Cadwalder could launch a diversion attack against the British garrison in Bordentown, to block the relief.
>>zsm_Latn<< General James Ewing would bring 700 militias across the river in Trenton Ferry, capturing the bridge over Assunpink Creek and preventing enemy troops from escaping.
>>zsm_Latn<< The main attacking force of 2,400 people will cross a nine-mile river north of Trenton, and then be divided into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
>>zsm_Latn<< With the change from running a quarter mile to running half a mile, the speed becomes less important and endurance becomes an absolute need.
>>zsm_Latn<< Indeed a mid-mile runner, which is capable of reaching half a mile in two minutes, must have an excellent speed but it must develop endurance in all hazards.
>>zsm_Latn<< A small part of the natural crossing in the winter, combined with the exercise of gimnasium for the upper body, is the best preparation for the run season.
>>zsm_Latn<< Proper nutrition practices alone cannot produce elite performance, but can significantly influence the health of young athletes as a whole.
>>zsm_Latn<< Maintaining healthy energy balance, practicing effective hydration habits, and understanding the various aspects of supplementation practices can help athletes improve performance and enjoyment of exercise.
>>zsm_Latn<< The middle distance runs are relatively cheap exercise; however, there are many misconceptions about the little equipment needed to join.
>>zsm_Latn<< Products can be purchased according to their needs, but most will have little or no impact on performance.
>>zsm_Latn<< The athletes may feel that they like a product even if the product does not provide real benefits.
>>zsm_Latn<< Atoms can be considered one fundamental drafting element of all matter.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is a very complex entity that consists, according to the simplifying of the Bohr model, over the electrons orbiting the nucleus center, similar to the planet orbiting the sun - see Figure 1.1.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nucleus consists of two particles - neutrons and protons.
Proton has a positive electric charge, while neutrons have no charge.
>>zsm_Latn<< To check the victim, you first have to observe the scene in order to ensure your security.
>>zsm_Latn<< You need to pay attention to the victim's position as you approach him, as well as notice the signs of automatic danger.
>>zsm_Latn<< If you are hurt while trying to help, you will only make the situation worse.
>>zsm_Latn<< The findings of the study were depression, fear, and the assumption that tragedy would occur mediating the relationship between pain and disability in lower back pain sufferers.
>>zsm_Latn<< Only the effects of disaster suspects, not depression and fear are the conditions of regular weekly structured PA sessions.
>>zsm_Latn<< Those who participate in routine activity need more support in terms of negative perception of pain that distinguish chronic pain and a sense of discomfort from normal physical movement.
>>zsm_Latn<< Vision, or sightability depends on the visual system on the sensory organs or the eyes.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are many kinds of eye construction, stretched based on its complexity based on the needs of its own organism.
>>zsm_Latn<< Different constructions have different abilities, depending on different wavelengths and have different degrees of sharpness, also need different processing in understanding different inputs and numbers in order to work optimally.
>>zsm_Latn<< Population is a collection of organisms of a particular species in a particular geographical area.
>>zsm_Latn<< When all individuals in a population are identical in terms of certain phenotic properties, they are called monomorphics.
>>zsm_Latn<< When a person shows some type of particular trait, they include polymorphics.
>>zsm_Latn<< The forces in the ant colony line as well as nest in various phases.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the nomaden phase, the army ants marched at night and stopped for lunch at noon.
>>zsm_Latn<< Colonies start the nomadent phase when available food decreases. During this phase, colonies make temporary hives that are replaced daily.
>>zsm_Latn<< Each potion or nomaden movement lasts about 17 days.
>>zsm_Latn<< The word cell is derived from the meaning of the Latin -cella - the small α and first created by a microscope that observes the structure of the gabus -
>>zsm_Latn<< Cells are the basic units of all living things, and all organisms are arranged from one or more cells.
>>zsm_Latn<< :Sel vital in learning life and very fundamental, cells are even usually called - the organizer of life -
>>zsm_Latn<< The Saraf system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body in order to keep the blood flow running and uninterrupted.
>>zsm_Latn<< This nerve impulse can be sent very quickly throughout a useful body in helping to keep the body from all potential threats.
>>zsm_Latn<< When compared to other violent storms, the tornado only attacks small areas, but can destroy everything it passes.
Tornado can remove trees, tear boards from buildings, and throw cars into the sky. Two percent of the most violent tornado can last for more than three hours.
>>zsm_Latn<< This large powered storm has a wind speed of up to 480 km/hour (133 m/dtk; 300 miles per hour).
>>zsm_Latn<< Humans have made and used a magnifying lens since thousands of years ago.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, the first original telescope was made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
>>zsm_Latn<< This telescope uses a combination of two lenses so that far objects look closer and larger.
>>zsm_Latn<< Greed and egoism will always be with us and are already the basic nature of cooperation when the majority is benefited, there will be more that can be achieved in the short term by acting selfishly.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hopefully, most people will realize that their long-term best choice is to work with others.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many people dream of the day when humans can travel to other stars and explore another world, some people wonder what there is out there, some people believe that aliens or other life might live on another planet.
- But if this happens, it may not be so long.
>>zsm_Latn<< Perhaps one day your grandparent will stand in an alien world trying to imagine what their ancient ancestors were like?
Animals are composed of many cells, animals eat and digest them, most animals can move.
>>zsm_Latn<< Only animals have brains (but not all animals have them; flowers, for example, do not have brains).
Animals can be found in various places on Earth, animals dig land, swim in the sea, and fly in space.
>>zsm_Latn<< Cells are the smallest functional and structural units of living beings (organism).
>>zsm_Latn<< Cells come from cella, which in latin means a small room.
>>zsm_Latn<< If you look at things with a microscope, you will see that they are made up of a small collection of squares or balls.
>>zsm_Latn<< Robert Hooke, a biologicalist from England, saw a small box inside the fog with a microscope.
It looks like a room, it's the first one to observe the cells die.
>>zsm_Latn<< Elements and compounds can move from one to another and do not change.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen.The liquid condition is denser, but the molecule is still the same.
Water is also composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
>>zsm_Latn<< It has the same molecular structure both gas, liquid substances, and solid objects.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although its physical form may change, but its chemical form will remain the same.
Time is something around us, and influences everything we do, though it is hard to understand.
>>zsm_Latn<< Time has been studied by religious, philosophical, and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
>>zsm_Latn<< We pass through time like a series of events passing from the future to the past.
>>zsm_Latn<< Time is also the way we compare the duration (length) of events.
You can mark yourself as time goes by, how to observe repeated events, and what happens again and again.
>>zsm_Latn<< Currently, computers are used to manipulate images and videos.
Modern animations can be designed on a computer. This type of animation is increasingly used on television and movies.
>>zsm_Latn<< Music is often recorded using advanced computers to process and mix voices.
>>zsm_Latn<< For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, who hunted giant birds called moas.
>>zsm_Latn<< The theory then coincided with the idea that the Maori migrated from Polynesia with the Great Armada and took New Zealand from Moriori, next forming a agraris society.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, new evidence indicates that Moriori was a group of land Maori who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own unique and peaceful cultures.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are also other tribes on the Chatham Islands, that is Maori who migrated from New Zealand.
>>zsm_Latn<< They call themselves Moriori, and then there are some small battles, but in the end, Moriori destroyed.
>>zsm_Latn<< The person who has been involved for decades helps us to appreciate our strength and zeal as well as accurately assessing difficulties and even failures.
>>zsm_Latn<< As individuals listen to sharing their own stories, families, and organizations, we gain valuable knowledge of the past and some personality that influences the organization's culture either good or bad.
>>zsm_Latn<< While understanding one's history does not assume an understanding of culture, it at least helps people get an understanding of their position in the history of the organization.
>>zsm_Latn<< When assessing the success and realization of the failure, the individual and the whole person who joins finds the value, mission, and forces of the organization more deeply.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this respect, given examples of previous entrepreneurial behavior and resulting in success that helped people to be open to new changes as well as new directions to local churches.
>>zsm_Latn<< Such a successful story reduces fear of change, at the same time creating a positive inclination to future changes.
>>zsm_Latn<< Convergen thought pattern is a problem solving technique that combines some idea or field to find a solution.
>>zsm_Latn<< The focus of this mindset is speed, logic, and accuracy, as well as fact identification, re-application of existing techniques, information collection.
>>zsm_Latn<< The most important factor in this mindset is: there is only one correct answer. You just think of two answers, that is true or false.
>>zsm_Latn<< This type of thinking relates to a particular science or standard procedure.
>>zsm_Latn<< People with this type of thinking have logical thinking, are able to memorize patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
>>zsm_Latn<< So far, humans are the most skilled species reading other human minds.
>>zsm_Latn<< That means we are able to predict well what other humans feel, mean, believe, know or want.
>>zsm_Latn<< Understanding the intentions of others is very important among these abilities, so that we can solve any possible ambiguity of physical action.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, if you see someone breaking a car window glass, you might think he is trying to steal people's cars.
>>zsm_Latn<< He needs to be assessed differently if he loses his car key and it is his own car that he is trying to enter.
>>zsm_Latn<< MRI based on a physical phenomenon named nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (work at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
>>zsm_Latn<< In this resonance, magnetic fields, and radio waves cause atoms to emit small radio signals.
>>zsm_Latn<< In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a medical doctor and research scientist, found the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnosis tool.
>>zsm_Latn<< Four years later a patent was given, which became the first patent in the world to be published in the field of MRI.
>>zsm_Latn<< In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first body-wide MRI scanner, which he named -Indomitable -
>>zsm_Latn<< Asynchronous communication encourages us to provide time to engage in reflection and react to others.
>>zsm_Latn<< It allows students to work at their speed and control the speed of instructional information.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, fewer time constraints with work hours may be more flexible. (Bremer, 1998)
>>zsm_Latn<< The use of the internet and the World Wide Web allows people who want to learn to acquire information access all the time.
>>zsm_Latn<< Students can also submit questions to the instructor at all times throughout the day and expect a fairly quick response, rather than waiting until the next face-to-face meeting.
>>zsm_Latn<< The postmodern approach to learning offers freedom from absolute things.Not determined in a good way to learn.
>>zsm_Latn<< In fact, none of the good things can be learned. Learning occurs in the experience between the learners and the knowledge presented.
>>zsm_Latn<< Our current experience with all learning-based television shows - do your own - and information presentation illustrates this ]
>>zsm_Latn<< So many of us find ourselves watching television shows that give thau a process or experience that does not allow us to participate or apply that knowledge.
>>zsm_Latn<< We will never block a car engine, build water leaks in the backyard, travel to Peru to check out the ancient ruins, or raid our neighbor's house.
>>zsm_Latn<< Thanks to underwater optical wires connected to Europe and wide tape satellites, Greenland is well connected which 93% of the population has internet access.
>>zsm_Latn<< Your hotel or host (if staying in a wimma or private home) is likely to have a wifi or PC connected to the internet, and all settlements have a warrant or some location with a general wifi.
>>zsm_Latn<< As mentioned above, although the term »Eskimo  remains accepted in the United States, but is considered demeaning to many non-Arctic citizens of the U.S., particularly in Canada-
>>zsm_Latn<< Although you may hear the word used by Native Greenlanders, its use should be avoided by foreigners.
>>zsm_Latn<< The native Greenlanders called themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (the hour of Kalaallit), a Greenlandian, in Greenland.
>>zsm_Latn<< ← Crime and prejudice against foreigners in general, in fact, are not known in Greenland.In fact, within the city there is no » harshaerah-
>>zsm_Latn<< The cold weather may be the only real danger that an unprepared person will face.
>>zsm_Latn<< If you visit Greenland during the winter (in consideration the getting north, the colder the temperature, the more important it is to bring warm clothes.
>>zsm_Latn<< A long day during the summer may cause sleep problems and associated health disorders.
>>zsm_Latn<< During the summer, beware of Nordic mosquitoes, which do not transmit any disease, but can be annoying.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although San Francisco's economy is associated with the city being an object of world class tourism, its economy is diverse.
>>zsm_Latn<< The biggest job sector is professional service, government, finance, trade, and tourism.
>>zsm_Latn<< The frequent depictions of music, movies, literature, and pop culture have helped to make cities and places of popular importance around the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with a number of hotels, restaurants, and best convention facilities.
>>zsm_Latn<< San Francisco is also one of the best places in this country for other Asian cuisines: Korea, Thailand, India, and Japan.
>>zsm_Latn<< Visiting Walt Disney World represents great pilgrimages for many American families.
>>zsm_Latn<< —Tikical visits - involve flight to Orlando International Airport, bus ride to Disney hotel in the place, spend about a week without leaving Disney's property, and return to the house -
>>zsm_Latn<< There are infinite variations that allow, but this remains the thing that most people mean when they talk about the -to go to Disney World -
>>zsm_Latn<< Many tickets sold online via auction site such as eBay or Craigslist are partly using multi-day-park-hopper tickets.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although it has been very frequent, Disney still imposes prohibitions: tickets cannot be handled.
>>zsm_Latn<< Establishing the camp under the Grand Canyon's edge was obliged to obtain permission from the authorities of the jurisdictional region.
>>zsm_Latn<< Permissions were restricted to protecting the hierarchy, which was available a date of one month, four months before the beginning of the month.
>>zsm_Latn<< Thus, permission to visit inland for the month of May is available on January 1.
>>zsm_Latn<< Space for the most popular area, such as the Earth of the Bright Angel Camp next to the Phantom Ranch, generally obtains many reservation requests as they have just opened.
>>zsm_Latn<< There is a limited amount of permission proposed for those who come directly, by the way who comes first, will get it.
>>zsm_Latn<< Entering southern Africa by riding a car is an amazing way to see all the beauty of this area as well as finding places that are generally far from the tourist route.
>>zsm_Latn<< This can be done in a regular car with romantic planning but it is highly recommended using 4x4 and many locations can only be accessed with a high-wheeled 4x4 vehicle.
>>zsm_Latn<< Please remember when compiling a plan that although South Africa is in stable conditions, not all neighboring countries are such.
>>zsm_Latn<< The requirements and costs of visa vary from one country to another and are influenced by your home country.
>>zsm_Latn<< Each country has a unique law rule requiring emergency goods to be available in the car.
>>zsm_Latn<< Victoria Falls is a town in western Zimbabwe, across the border from Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
>>zsm_Latn<< The city is located right next to the waterfall, and they are the main attraction, but this popular tourist goal offers many opportunities for adventure seekers and tourists to be there longer.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the rainy season (from November to March), the volume of water will be higher and the Falls will appear more dramatic.
>>zsm_Latn<< You are guaranteed to be wet if you cross a bridge or walk along the trail of a prank near the Falls.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, it is precisely because the volume of water is so high that the view to the Falls will blurâ € as a result of that water!
>>zsm_Latn<< Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 was probably the most popular tomb in this Valley, where Howard Carter, was, in 1922, found a nearly intact royal burial of a young king.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, compared with most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun's tomb is almost unattractive to be visited because it is much smaller and its decorations are limited.
>>zsm_Latn<< Anyone who is interested in seeing evidence of damage to the mumies during the attempt to remove him from the chest will be disappointed, for only the head and shoulders are visible.
>>zsm_Latn<< The treasure was no longer in the tomb because it had been transferred to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
>>zsm_Latn<< Visitors with limited time will better spend their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom is located 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. The temple at the top of this hill was built in the 9th century, during the reign of King Yasovarman.
>>zsm_Latn<< The bleak atmosphere and sight of Lake Tonle Sap makes climbing to the hill valuable.
