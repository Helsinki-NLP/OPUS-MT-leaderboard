>>zsm_Latn<< The new teacher is in class.
Tom missed his family.
>>zsm_Latn<< It starts at ten o'clock.
Wait!
>>zsm_Latn<< Both parents are fine.
Can I turn on the TV?

>>zsm_Latn<< Sleep and wait for luck.
I just finished breakfast.
Did you go to school with a bus?
Tom looks surprised.
Let's have lunch!
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom closes the drawer.
We need to talk to you.
I'm from Brazil
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom will not do so unless you ask for it.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some animals eat their young.
He's always polite.
Am I hallucinating?
I'll be back in an hour.
This is the real story.
I don't understand this at all.
You can go wherever you like.
Fuck!
>>zsm_Latn<< He says that he has returned his book to the library.
He's mad at his son.
We saw a monkey in a zoo.
>>zsm_Latn<< Bill never quarreled with anyone else.
I'll come with you.
Let's let him do it.
Will you stay here for a while?
>>zsm_Latn<< How much is the average price for the store rent here?
It was like watching a slow movie.
I hope he can help me.
Tom knows it's time to go.
I have to go to the room.
He doesn't want to tell you his name.
>>zsm_Latn<< Green open space is the lungs of the city.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom wants to wear his new shoes.
He works at the factory.
>>zsm_Latn<< Our school Festival was held last month.

You can go there.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom prepares to go to school.
You're right.
You don't have an AC?
>>zsm_Latn<< He cannot distinguish which is good and which is bad.
Looks like my suitcase has been stolen.
Don't you understand?
I'm at home tomorrow.
There's nothing wrong with Tom.
I'm bored.
>>zsm_Latn<< Half of the students were absent.
>>zsm_Latn<< The human body is arranged from many bones to one frame.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lately, few people have visited me.
>>zsm_Latn<< We have asked the wrong kind of question.
Tom said he'd call you back.
How are you?
Come here.
>>zsm_Latn<< He has been teaching music for 30 years.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom set the table.
He never danced with her.
Did you see Tom?
>>zsm_Latn<< I've read the book before.
Hore!
Unable to overcome his courage, he should be admired.
Do what?
Take it easy, don't worry.
Have you ever gone to the Black Sea?
It's all my fault.
I thought I'd be on vacation this week.
When's your birthday?
I'll take my car.
I'm afraid of cats.
I fully agree.
Yoko is in London right now.
Let me see it.
What are you doing here?
I'm glad to be here.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom looks for a restaurant at an affordable price.
Mary's not my boyfriend.
>>zsm_Latn<< I'll just buy the car if they first fix the brakes.
My father bought me a book.
You still don't understand it?
Aw!
Never storm in this room.
Because I don't argue that everyone will believe in a dead woman.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mary's favorite movie is The Princess Bride.
I don't know about this.
Can I ask you a question?
Do you have Tom's address?
>>zsm_Latn<< His negotiations were canceled.
What class is your brother?
Too bad you can't come.
You know something about fixing the computer?
I'm bored.
Happy birthday!
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
>>zsm_Latn<< I feel happy with myself.
Everything's gonna be fine.
>>zsm_Latn<< Does Tom know what he should do?

Where do you want to go?
What do you want to wear?
I'm going to Tokyo tomorrow.
>>zsm_Latn<< The life of a banker is difficult.
I'm afraid we're late.
Maybe you still have a newspaper last Saturday?
What's the most scary thing and happened to you?
Find Tom before he hurt someone.
This is the right decision, with no side of it being harmed.
Bill was a baseball player.
>>zsm_Latn<< This room is very warm.
That's not possible.
A word is enough for a wise person.
Don't go first.
Tom likes fiction science.
Looks like we're gonna waste time if we wait longer.
I saw Tom in the hallway.
Where did he go?
Look.
I want to say that.
He doesn't like fighting.
I have to make good use of that little space.
>>zsm_Latn<< I told Tom that I thought it was a good idea.
He's the head of the marketing department.
I'm tired of hearing that.
>>zsm_Latn<< Put on your cloak correctly.
If it rains, then I won't go.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom feels happy.
>>zsm_Latn<< The people at the corner of the world celebrated the New Year of China.
He's sending a newspaper.
Exactly what you're saying.
You can't eat dessert until you spend your food.
Five years have passed since they came to Japan.

I was inspected by the Bea and Cukai officers at the airport.
I'll go if the weather is bright.
If you want to be happy, then be happy.
Good night, ladies.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most Japanese drink tap water.
I really like your hair style.

We don't want to be the last one there.
Can you borrow your phone?
Sit down!
I'm more beautiful than you.
Why did you open the box?
Are you there?
I'll take you to the airport.
I'm sending two glasses of orange juice.
>>zsm_Latn<< The mayor showed the citizens how to act.
>>zsm_Latn<< He began to be a picky lately.

It's an interesting book, isn't it?
She told me that she was going to visit Nara next month.
>>zsm_Latn<< How can love love love be?
Yuki has a lot of books.
I always wonder what it would be like to have a brother.
Let them take care of themselves.
There's a big road near my house.
I'll kill you.
>>zsm_Latn<< She shakes her hands and smiles.
Can you repeat it again?
I wonder what Tom's doing here.
You don't have to hurry.
I'm hungry.
This is a good question.
I closed the window so that the baby wouldn't be exposed to the pick.
>>zsm_Latn<< Is there a similar saying in Japanese?
We just have to wait for the right time.
>>zsm_Latn<< I left my dictionary on the bottom floor.
>>zsm_Latn<< Croatia is in southeastern Europe.
I'm going to live in my uncle's place in Kyoto.
Are you interested in me?
>>zsm_Latn<< Traffic congestion causes me to be late for meeting/ meeting.
I'm so tired.
>>zsm_Latn<< As far as I know, those rumors are not true.
Is there anything you want to know?
>>zsm_Latn<< All fallen apples are eaten by pigs.
I failed.
My boys still believe in Santa Claus.
>>zsm_Latn<< How long does the bear sleep?
Actually, I've never seen him.
I'll get you down at the station.
Let's do it again.
>>zsm_Latn<< He completed every task he had ever taken.
Can I ask you for your help?
My teacher showed me where to put my fault.
We have two children.
I love her so much, I'll be willing to die for her.
Tracy lost her glasses.
I don't know.
Tom said he wanted to be alone.
I didn't ask for your help.
A cup of coffee will make you feel better.
What do I have to do with you?
Take it and go!
Do you want a drink?
How can I find out?
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom will stop on Monday.
I feel a bit uncomfortable today.
>>zsm_Latn<< It relaxes at the edge of the pool.
Don't play with me.
>>zsm_Latn<< I was joined in a musical group.
>>zsm_Latn<< She wants to buy the book.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom must have worked very hard.
I don't know why that could happen.
I'll wait here until he comes.
You prefer to go to a zoo or a movie?

I still think Tom's guilty.
Nancy didn't play tennis.

I can be crazy if this goes on.
He gave me a wide smile.
Tom needs a friend.
These are the best years of your life.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom should be stopped.
He helped me.
That's why he doesn't gossip.
It turned out to be true.
I'm not my sister's maid.
We met in front of my door.
Have you had dinner?

Do you know where we're going?
I'll talk about this with you later, okay?
Did you leave the tip?
>>zsm_Latn<< As a result of traffic congestion, he cannot see his departure at the station.

When are you going back?
Where are you going?

I have a friend whose father has a famous novelist.
I can do this all day.
Pull!
>>zsm_Latn<< The man could not only speak English but also German.
I'm not as stupid as you think.
Tom refuses to do that.
This novel is hard to understand.
Why aren't you playing banjo anymore?

>>zsm_Latn<< Tom would not like that answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to contact us before.
>>zsm_Latn<< Without fear, he refuses to give up.
>>zsm_Latn<< I'm trying to write about ethnic and minority religions.
I must've made a mistake.
I met my old friend.
>>zsm_Latn<< The knife is too blunt until it can't be used to cut meat, eventually I use my pocket knife.
He's blind.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's a bullet.
Where have you been?
>>zsm_Latn<< The traffic lights are used to regulate traffic.
>>zsm_Latn<< Don't let Tom look at these photos.
This room gets a little sunlight.
He's drawing a picture.
I shouldn't have broken that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I'm getting used to not fight.
It smells so bad.
>>zsm_Latn<< A sentence is a sentence.
There is no god other than Allah and He is the messenger of Allah.
Just yesterday I found out.
>>zsm_Latn<< You can buy it in the bookstore.
>>zsm_Latn<< Let's take an Intercity-Express train.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My brother likes music.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is very easy to get along with Tom.
Want to go home?
Nobody cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I think I can come this day.
- It's not in vain we're waiting for two hours.
Tom is one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I just told Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's ants.
>>zsm_Latn<< You will never be able to find a way home, through a narrow rocky path.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom is really not at home when we come to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
The man is driving a car.
>>zsm_Latn<< Detail the birthday card that will soon come.
Please read it again.
You know when?
I'm just kidding.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom almost had to hit.
I'm going too.
Love never goes wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
>>zsm_Latn<< The cost already included payment for professional services to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn a logogram, do you?
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom tries to persuade Mary to help her.
>>zsm_Latn<< Two things are not related.
>>zsm_Latn<< How can I not realize this?
What's this called?
I stay at home because it's raining down.
That's the right answer.
>>zsm_Latn<< In general, men run faster than women.
>>zsm_Latn<< To me, there was no fundamental difference between cultures from both countries.
He's having an affair.
Get me up at eight o'clock.
Tell me why he's not present.
>>zsm_Latn<< That may have influenced their decision.
>>zsm_Latn<< The rain lasts for a full night.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom is beginning to be jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that horrible?
I'll buy this bag for you.
>>zsm_Latn<< The cake is too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Did you ever go to London?
This is our responsibility to help.
How's the party?
I'm not ready.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mary refused an invitation to the concert.
When are you going home?
>>zsm_Latn<< He sits around his grandchildren.
>>zsm_Latn<< The child is asleep on his bed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Jim is still not used to driving on the left side of the road.
>>zsm_Latn<< He focused on the puzzle.
The man died a few hours ago.
Want to go eat with me?
It feels like a dream for me.
I just ate.
We know that the front door is locked.
Can I talk to Mr. Sato?
>>zsm_Latn<< This water is not smelly.
Mr. Smith is his acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying with a plane.
>>zsm_Latn<< I had suspected that he was lying, but that didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice, I have to do this.
I can't finish reading this thick book in a week.
>>zsm_Latn<< The time selection is very important.
Tom, are you okay?
>>zsm_Latn<< We have a lot of furniture.
>>zsm_Latn<< Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have any other choice.
I'm not sure what else I have to do.
We've done what we can.
Is there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
>>zsm_Latn<< As I walked along this road, I met a woman.
>>zsm_Latn<< Can't you speak English?
>>zsm_Latn<< Before our law all are aligned, but rich people sometimes have more advantages.
He must have worked.
I like cats.
It's done on nine o'clock.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom is mentally distracted.
Maybe I'm crazy?
>>zsm_Latn<< We face a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
>>zsm_Latn<< Let's look for solutions that everyone can accept.
Everyone has made mistakes.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mother hasn't been ten years since.
There's no perfect man.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, just you can't drive.
Can I see your coupon?
>>zsm_Latn<< He looks serious reading.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom marries a woman who is easier than she is.
He's a copy of his father.
>>zsm_Latn<< He has good words to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm enthusiastic.
>>zsm_Latn<< He tried to commit suicide but eventually failed.
Do you have a light beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
If I'm reincarnation, I want to be born again as a cat.
We got a lot of rain this summer.
>>zsm_Latn<< He made scientific discoveries important.
He's a student.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom is already here, but Bill is still not coming.
Laurie lasing.
>>zsm_Latn<< They suggest it to go alone.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom is a good man.
I'll call back in 20 minutes.
They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian goes to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom lied to Mary.
>>zsm_Latn<< Not less than 40 percent of students go on to university education.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom puts the pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom shrinks his voice so that no one can hear it.
You see something?
What are you looking at?
Is he long hair?
>>zsm_Latn<< She greets him every morning, as he enters the school building.
I think he's a doctor.
>>zsm_Latn<< The tour is very steep, preferably past the left.
We didn't really see that accident.
>>zsm_Latn<< Her mother is worried about her son.
>>zsm_Latn<< What capacity is being shown at the Lincoln Center today?
I feel tired.
Tom was killed by Mary.
>>zsm_Latn<< The data is often inaccurate.
Get up!
We've ordered the six thirty.
We named the dog Tim.
>>zsm_Latn<< He quickly opened the letter.
Where's the train station?
>>zsm_Latn<< Tom signals Mary to follow him.
It's eleven hours.
I'm smarter than them.
The sky is getting dark.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knew her admired her.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those people are crazy!
