The combined incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases show similar goals in European Union/European Economic Area countries and in the United Kingdom proving that, while at another stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in all countries.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and units of intensive care should increase their readiness to stream in patients with COVID-19 who will need health care, and intensive care in particular.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia unknown in the area of aetiology were reported in Wuhan, Province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus now referred to as a passive respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Because, the disease that results from SARS-CoV-2 infection is named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date is ca 80% of indibidwals with COVID-19 have mild disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them heal.
In ca 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes a more serious disease requiring hospitalization as the remaining 6% of cases experience a critical disease requiring intensive care.
The death of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we are assessing trends in the combined event of COVID-19 per European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and comparing them to the Hubei Province, China.
We will also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases with the EU/EEA countries in Italy on 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
Following China, COVID-19 underwent additional geographical diffusion and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are currently following in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization's Director General (WHO) declared that COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue 2020 on 5 March, Spistere et al. reported in the first cases of COVID-19 signed Europe in accordance with WHO's definition of the case.
In the US/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 on people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Up to 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were referred to all 30 countries in the US/EEA and United Kingdom (UK), where between 31 December 2019 and with that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Taking a combined number and joint incident of COVID-19 cases
In the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the stated case of COVID-19 in every country around the world, obtained only from sources officials such as the Ministry of Health of the nations, national and regional health authority and WHO, are periodically each day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used for assessment of COVID-19 goals in the US/EEA and UK, and comparing them to Italy.
As a representative of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated 14 days of amputation combined incidents of COVID-19 cases, so considering the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EA and UK country, during 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also showed the combined number of reported cases of each country on 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared to in Italy on the day 31 January-15 March 2020.
Trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
The trends of 14 days which do not have a subsequent combined incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and in the UK follow in general the Hubei Province (China) (Law 1).
For the US/EEA and the UK in mass, the combined event of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and then rose rapidly at 28 February 2020 (Add material).
It is most abbreviated by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other countries in the US/EEA and UK have shown the same rising direction of the combined incidence of COVID-19 (Great material).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA and UK countries compared to Italy at the time of 31 January - 15 March 2020.
It highlights that, on March 15 8:00 a.m, 15 other countries in the US/EEA and UK reported the total number of cases comparable to Italy in the previous 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of expressed cases of COVID-19 is rising rapidly in the US/EEA and UK.
The observed goals in the combined incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pancreas is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
It is even in different stages countries, there are differences in national public health responses, and possible different case definitions in countries and different choice protocols for patients to be diagnosed for COVID-19 confirmation, including the hunting analysis.
Early in March 2020, doctors in the affected region of Italy described a situation in which ca 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care and the media reported that hospitals and units of intensive care in these regions had reached their highest capacity.
Data for access to COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or unit of intensive care can currently be used at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% cases, as mentioned (not shown data).
Nevertheless, they must be collected in a systematic way to add to the current observation data focused on the number of known cases and number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010&11 showed a significant difference in the usability of intensive care and beds in central European care, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care for every 100,000 populations in 2010-11).
>>zsm_Latn<< Modelling scenarios are relayed to healthcare capacity isolation, with estimations for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of hospitated COVID-19 cases associated with a > 90% rissk of exercise intensive care bed capacity, which is provised in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Because today's cases are combined by some regions in the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and units of intensive care (intensive care units) usually serve a reference taken population, information about cases and beds in intensive care should be better prepared to be used at the level Nomenclature of tertiary units for statics 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy experience and current trains in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in the US/EEA and UK.
Countries, hospitals and units of intensive care should prepare themselves for the scenario of long-term transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to the community and the rise in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring health care, and in particular intensive care, as in the affected areas of Italy.
As stated in the recent rapid assessment of ECDC risk, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is important for the delay in the spread of SARS-COV-2, when there is a move from the near-containment solution (containment) to the immediate resistance (migration), because the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give subscribers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and carry out their response if not implemented earlier.
Quick risk assessment also lists public health measures to reduce the high impact of the pancreas.
There is a short space of opportunity where countries have the possibility of increasing their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing health care pressure.
In frustration with this, it is likely that health care systems by other EU/EEA countries will face the influx of patients who need intensive care over the coming days or weeks.
The spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a single acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), today has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in disaster for humans.
Similar to the virus similar to this, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transferred from bats and would cause similar symptoms through the same mechanism.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has lower severity and modality than SARS but it is easier to spread and affect more old individuals than youth and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publishings on the emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly emerging research topic.
We will cover basic knowledges of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
While many questions still require answers, we expect this poem to help understand and remove the threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and memorable memory for all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors throughout the vacation and for many weeks after the spread of a new disease from the virus.
The virus had a large similarity to the coronavirus (CoV) which caused the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and about 50 others around the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being returned home and more than 3,000 patients killed.
- WHO reminds that COVID-19 is αnumero 1 public enemy - and possibly more powerful than terrorism-
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers were published in COVID-19 along with agham in microbiology education, epidemic education, origin, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 which refers to the sequence of microbials separated from many patients.
This poem tries to summarize the progress of research in the new and rapidly developed area of the subject.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a 2012 prevalence).
We will also discuss what we have learned about prevention and diagnosis of the disease as well as some remaining but immediate questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens in humans, which mainly cause approximately 15% of the common cold 4.
Nevertheless, in this century, we have seen twice the high pathogenic cities CoV, that is, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have caused a spread that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, as mentioned, and has soon spread to many other countries with terrible morphity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third prevalence of CoV in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Fig. As shown in Fig. Fig.1, the cluster of pulmonary unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 in China's National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was issued.
On January 15, 2020 the first deadly case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly in neighboring towns, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, health care providers' infection was reported, suggesting human-human transfer is possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was on-lockdown with the cessation of all its public transport.
On January 24 the first clinical study of the disease reported that, in 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the marine market in Wuhan which was considered the source site of infection from the unknown animal origin.
On January 30, WHO declared the spread of a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, disease has spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2) .2). (Fig.2).
As the situation progresses rapidly, the final scope and severity of the spread remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a mass-centered study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients showed a more timely description of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has left people all ages, but above all in the age of 30-65.
About half (47.7%) of individual infecteds are over 50 years old, fewer are younger than 20, and only 14 individual infecteds are younger in 10 years.
More men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000) were infected by SARS-CoV-2.
COVID-19 expanded when clustered primarily and around Hubei.
COVID-19 lasts average 5 (2-9) days from start to diagnosis.
The average time of incubation is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average period from start to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) day.
>>zsm_Latn<< The basc reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly before 23 January 2020, matching the time of mass travel prior to the Spring Festival in China.
>>zsm_Latn<< The mortality of patents with conditioned cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all the patents was over 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (€60), and acute pneumonia.
CoVs are subfamily of large wrapped viruses that contain the single strand of sequence RNA.
They can be divided into four categories, ha., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, where alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The endope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to cellular receptors that are angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipidyl peptidese 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA combined with bound glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms irons containing virion, which then joins the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been known to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity in 10 consecutive samples collected from the original spread area, the Huan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the overly thin sections of epithelium in the human airway.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Nevertheless, S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 of man weaker than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short-encoded orf3b protein and a secreted orf8-encoded protein.
The ORf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may have a role in viral pathogenity and prevent the release of IFNβ; yet, orf8 does not possess any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported cryo-EM structure of whole human ACE2 at 2.9 A resolution with amino acid transporter B0AT 1.
They found that the complex, with open closed imports, was collected as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing evidence for CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 can be a treatment target for drug filtering to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and intermediate host
It was learned that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from bats and were transferred to humans by means of mules and camels, as mentioned.
With the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered the native host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to two mal-SARS CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat -SL-CoVZX21.
Still, it remains unknown what intermediate hosts have helped the virus to cross species barriers to infect people, and the transmission route should still be enlightened.
Ji, et al., suggested snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to people involving recombinant efforts within S protein.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that long-long-songing, ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in a CoV found in meringulins and SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the 1% difference spread to the two genomes is still a major difference; thus, the conclusive results for concrete evidence are awaited (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical components of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been referenced to mass.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%-50% mild.
SARS-CoV-2 can have similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heats at 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, disinfectant containing chlorine, acidic pearcetic, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively stop the virus.
The entire human population in general has no immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 and alligator is susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been recorded about the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only consult previous studies with other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4). (Fig.4). (Fig.4).
In general, after a virus attacks the host, it is first identified by the host initate immune system by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) along with C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR) ), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus initiates the emergence of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell formation, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that restrict viral spread and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
Nevertheless, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus lose from immune response.
Soon, adaptive immune response joined in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes along with CD4 + and CD8+ T cells have an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells encouraged B cells to produce antibodies specifically to the virus, and CD8 + T cells kill cells infected with the virus.
T helmet cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to aid defensive cells.
Nevertheless, CoV can inhibit T cell productions by initiating the death of T cells.
Humoral immunity including additions such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also important in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies to be separated from the healer are neutralizing MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the immune system’s overreaction creates a large number of free radicals in the area and can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, eliminate multiple organs and even die.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighted by clustering at first, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and buns.
Usually people exposed to large number of viruses or compromised immune functions, have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The requested mean incubation period SARS-CoV-2 was 1-14 days, often 3-7 days based on a study in the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
Nevertheless, a study in 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period is 3 days in average and from 0 to 24 days.
A newer study, as described above, shows that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) day based on demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to fix effective quarantitine time based on the most accurate time of incubation, in order to prevent infected but non symptomatic people from transferring the virus to others.
As a common practice, indibidwals exposed to, or infected by, viruses usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantination period be extended for 24 days?
COVID-19 is often a primary and preliminary symptom of fever, which can be accompanied by no symptomatic or other symptoms such as dry cough, nausea, muscle pain, poisoning, headaches, swollen throat, nose fluid buildup, chest pain, nausea , and vomiting.
Some patients experienced stuttering and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have rapidly improved in the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagroathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and chronic fever, even without pulmonary image abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for diarrhea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies in a family cluster and a cluster caused by passing from an individual asymptomatic.
By comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also developed fever (98%), dry coughs (47%), and seizures (55%) as their primary symptoms.
Nevertheless, 80% of these require ventilation support, more than COVID-19 patients and conform to higher MERS mortality than COVID-19.
The diarrhea (26%) and swollen throat (21%) have also been observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), diarrhea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and swollen throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and ventilation support was needed for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
By February 14, the death of COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed case reached 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the death rate in SARS in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed case.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, death is 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with 95% trust gap (CI) which was 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV reached only from 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in conjunction with their symptoms, mortality, and R0 has been shown in the List of Lists1.1.Table1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less fatal than the last two.
Thus, it is more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The clustered start often occurs in the same family or from the same gathering or vehicle such as a crueship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residency in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with individual infected or patients for the past two weeks before the beginning.
Nevertheless, it has been reported that the virus can infect people without symptoms longer than two weeks and that the recovered patients released from hospitals may have a virus again, providing an alarm to prolong the quarantitine period.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with the number of white blood cells < 4×109/L along with the number of lymphocytes < 1×109/L, and the elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were found in 1,099 patients of COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin have been added to the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocytes sedimentation have been added to the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, rose, and gradually decreased lymphocyte rates.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are highlighted by the bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop an asymptical pneumonia, chronic lung injury, and acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
The misfolding of type-I and type-II pneumocytes lowers the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand and increase the risk of pulmonary giving.
Therefore, the worst known radiographic in the chest is often parallel to the strongest boundary of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first diagnosis of the cause of COVID-19 showed the spread of pneumocytes, the formation of a broken membrane, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which are compatible with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and are similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main standard for diagnosis of COVID-19.
Nevertheless, due to a high rate of false-negative rate, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manipulates for diagnosis (which did not rely only on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manipulations, laboratory tests, and radiologicals that have been identified are important and necessary for developing an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol using the SERLOCK technique based on CRISPR to see SARS-CoV-2, which focuses on SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick less than an hour without the need of a complex instrument.
It is hoped that the new technique can be most noticeable in sensitivity and convenience if absorbed in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience in the new CoV, physicians may provide basic support care for COVID-19 patients; while testing various therapies used or previously proposed for treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS- CoV and other viral diseases (Hanayan2).2).(Table2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments of antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from cured patients has been suggested to be used in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies take the lead in developing antibodies and vaccines against microbes.
The SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at the beginning and is also likely to be attacked, at a lower level, other organs expressing ACE2, like the intestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, misatonation and noise loss are a major threat to patients and a leading cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is critical in order to eliminate symptoms and save lives and with general oxygen treatment, high flow oxygen, uncontrolled ventilation, and sustainable de-manned ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to be supported by extracorporaneal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat life threatening heart loss or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of important organs are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been learned that a cytokinestorm results from the immune system's excessive reaction to SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokinestorm is a form of systemic response response that is highlighted by releasing a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNβ, IFNβ, and MCP-1.
This cytokines cause the immune cells to release a large number of free radials which are the main cause of ARDS and loss of many organs.
Treatment of cytokine storms is essential for immunosuppression, especially in serious patients.
Corticosteroids and tociizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used in the treatment of cytokinestorms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokinestorm include modulation of T cell-directed immune response; the blocking of IFN-α, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blintuomob; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
Nevertheless, high dose steroids do not benefit from severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteoncrosis, which significantly affects prognosis.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses were recommended to be used carefully for COVID-19 patients with critical disease.
During writing, no effective antiviral treatment was confirmed.
Nevertheless, root giving with remedeivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir, first developed by Gilead, is a new antiviral drug for treating diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
In time, the remedeivir also showed possible suppression of other single stranded RNA viruses along with MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead gave the compound to China to perform a pair of didividal tests infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results were expected to the majority.
In addition, baccitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and satavirin have been suggested as potential therapy for patients with chronic respiratory symptoms.
Staging, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur following the equipped treatment of lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be monitored closely.
Plasma from recovered patients and the creation of antibody
Collecting blood from patients who recover from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from disease infection has a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the cause of their blood disease.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) developed by B lymphocytes to fight the causes of disease and other foreign matter and they recognize unique molecules in the causes of disease and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who were cured at COVID-19 and infected with 10 patients who were seriously ill.
Their symptoms improved for 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen synthesis in the blood.
Nevertheless, verification and clarification are needed to suggest the methodology for major use before particular therapies can be developed.
In addition, due to therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disclaimers should be taken into consideration carefully.
Antibodies, for example, can greatly stimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potential life - threatening poisoning threat.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and there is a great need for plasma to treat patients with critical disease.
It is difficult to form and produce particular antibodies at a high speed to combat the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more critical and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the encoding of genetic codes of effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against vital viral proteins.
In this way, we can easily measure the production of antibodies.
TCM was used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
Nevertheless, its effects depend primarily on a combination of many components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most effective ingredients remain unsustainable or ambiguous because the said ingredients are hard to pick and fold or their best combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and particular therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for healers from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective for treatment of COVID-19.
The leading treatments of COVID-19 patients were observed in some rural areas of China using TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in an estimated 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest rate of recovery (13%).
Nevertheless, this is a somewhat coarse comparison because many other reasons for strong effects such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the intervention.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of western medicine (WM) only with the provisional treatment of WM and TCM.
They learned that the hours required for body temperature recovery, symptom loss, and hospitalization were noticeably shorter in the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone.
The most impressive, the number of symptomatic progression (from mild to severe) is noticeably lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM group only (7.4% against 46.2%) and mortality is lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group only (8.8% counter 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM still await tests that are well controlled and broader scale and in more centres.
It is also curious to define the mechanism of actions and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experienced much of the fear of highly infectious and deadly disease, and people-quaratine also experienced boredom, sadness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection such as fever, lack of oxygen reaching tissues or hypoxia, and cough as well as side effects of treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and mental anxiety.
In the early stages of the spread of SARS, a range of psychiatric morbidities was reported to include persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delinquency, and suicide.
Forced evacuation of contact and quarantitine, as part of the responses of public health to the prevalence of COVID-19, can cause people to be more concerned and guilty in conjunction with the effects of contamination, quarantitine, and stigma in their families and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be given to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, and people interacting with them as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health groups, clear communications with regular and accurate moments about the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are important for stopping the transmission chain from pregnant animals and infected people into susceptible hosts and frequent antiviral treatment aid in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts were made to form S protein-based vaccines to create long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Living-attenuated vaccines have been analyzed in animal models for SARS.
Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in old individuals and models of fatal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection has not yet been referred to before a clinical study began.
This is probably because SARS died 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
In contrast, spradic cases and MERS clusters continue to take place in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the ongoing zoonotic sources in the enemic areas.
The vaccination strategies were developed for MERS through the use of inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, mal-virus particles and recombinant protein subunits and analyzed some of the animal models.
The formation of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immune indibidwals is an immediate and critical function for the control of the current epidemic.
Nevertheless, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty due to the long term (which is up to 18 months) needed for vaccine production and the dynamics of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to show its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover briefly without a sequelae.
Nevertheless, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high-intensity illness and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Around, the development of the disease prognosis model is important for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies that have been recorded so far, the following reason can affect or be linked to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Remembered (Table33):(Table33):
Age: Age: Age is the most important reason for SARS prognosis, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs primarily at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care are more likely to have hidden comorbidities and complications and are meaningful older than those not (at median age 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: Kasarian: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 in need of intensive care are more likely to suffer from chronic heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to false liver function in COVID-19 patients.
It is very important to remember that age and hidden disease are strongly linked and can distract each.
Abnormal laboratory bindings: Abnormalities known in the laboratory: C-reactive protein level (CRP) in the blood analyzes the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been suggested as a potential prognostic factor for disease, therapy response, and complete recovery.
The correlation of CRP levels to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, the elevator lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict outcome.
These enzymes are widely demonstrated in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are a traditional sign of false heart function or liver.
Major clinical symptoms: Major clinical symptoms: chest radiography and temporal improvement of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues for predicting outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: Using steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammation.
Because a high dose of corticosteroids is widely used in serious SARS patients, many survivors have suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with a lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and in short term in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: Stress in mind: as described above, in the prevalence of COVID-19 many patients suffered from unusual stress because they often endured long-term quarantitine and severe uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and calm patients.
It is important to give psychological advice and long-term support to help heal these patients from stress and get back to normal life.
According to demographic studies to this day, SARS in COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics.
In addition to copying the lower respiratory pathway, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively increase in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other CoVs causing common colds.
Swimming, infected patients in the early period or incubation period can form multiple viruses during daily activity, causing significant difficulty in the control of the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the SARS-CoV move was considered to have occurred when patients were seriously ill, as most of the move in the first section did not occur.
Thus, the current spread of COVID-19 is more serious and difficult to control than the spread of SARS.
Great effort is currently being undertaken in China along with the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuedquaratine by almost the entire population in hopes of cutting down the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While these actions have been severely detrimental to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients has decreased, indicating the decline of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate will complete the spread at the end of March and the fall will last 3-4 months.
Nevertheless, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., tweeted that COVID-19, which seems more infectious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the two-thirds of the world population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 observed the same mid-turbate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could be a cycling episode similar to the flu.
Nevertheless, promises of signification have occurred in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating that current dischartes may work.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases with half million deaths.
Nevertheless, by strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was eventually prevented.
Possibly similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be weaker in infecting and dying later or even a virus that reduces the disease that lives with humans.
Comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Fig.55). (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is fully transmitted by coughing or breaking, and can also be by direct contact with viral contamination materials.
The virus has also been found in pollutants, adding a new possibility of contamination from the waste to the mouth.
A new study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possible causes of hospital-based infections, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Thus, there should be extreme measures to protect people, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even observers who are infected with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is by wearing face masks; the same use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (serye # 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Operational face masks suppress liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from air travel or attaching to surfaces of materials, where they can be passed to others.
Nevertheless, only N95 (story # 1860s) masks can protect against inhaling virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions that can penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size as SARS-CoV and both approximately 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate even five primary-placed Surgical masks, health care providers that directly interact with patients should wear N95 (serye # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers must wear applied isolation gowns to reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also infect an indibidwal with the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore a N95 mask; the virus could enter his body through his swelling eyes.
Thus, health-care providers should also wear clear face shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potential affected areas, it is strongly recommended that all people wash their hands with disinfectant detergents more often than before, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
The three beats are considered an appropriate distance for people to stay from a patient.
These actions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as preventing viral spread.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has been transferred as a new virus in the human world, its high homology in SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused high alert in China based on its deep memory in the spread of SARS in 2003.
Nevertheless, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Center for Disease Control of Wuhan calms citizens by saying that the new virus has low contamination and limited growth from man to man and is not a problem avoiding and preventing disease .
This message significantly calms the public alarm, especially as the whole country prepares for the Spring Festival, and passes the critical opportunity to prevent the disease at its lowest level in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may consider this difficult lesson and make critical improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when making public imports because each word is important to the citizen and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to prevent a potential epidemic in its early stage rather than attempting to reach the public; and (4) more frequently release targeted and effective drums to increase public consciousness about epidemics and occasionally to test the social response system.
The prevalence of COVID-19 caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and near 50 other countries around the world during this writing period.
Because SARS-CoV is almost identical to the virus and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of recurrent SARS.
Nevertheless, there are several wonderful variations between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the prevention of epidemic and treatment in patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals than youth and more men than women, and the severity and rate of death are also higher in the elderly individuals than in youth.
SARS is higher in modality than in COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus without symptoms while SARS patients are usually done when they are seriously ill, causing more difficulty to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than the SARS.
This rarely explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can repositive to the virus.
These findings significantly increase the risk of viral spread.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homologs have been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two mal-SARS seizures CoVs, we are still not as strong as SARS-CoV-2 bats.
To what animal will the intermediate species transfer the virus from the original host, we say bats, to humans?
The answers to #1 and 2, we cannot efficiently cut the transfer, and the spread can change at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the airflow cells and cause the resulting pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind cells that declare ACE2 to other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we could not get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during transmission to humans?
Will it be a worldwide pandemic, disappearing like SARS or periodically returning like a flu?
This is important but may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
Nevertheless, no matter what the cost may be, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
Zoonic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the joint evolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their hosts, including people, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoV) were referred to as developing mild illness, such as common cold.
The prevalences of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) showed how severe and life - threatening infection with HCoV has been.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put CoVs to notice and we were surprised at its rapid transfer but decreased pathogenity or cause of disease compared to its SARS-CoV brother.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotics that come from HCoVs will serve us well.
Most HCoVs come from bats where they do not cause disease (pathogen).
Intermediate reservoirs of some HCoVs are also known.
Referring to animal hosts has a direct implications for avoiding human diseases.
The investigation of CoV-host interactions with animals can also take an important view of the CoV pathogenesis of humans.
In this poem, we show a general view of existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, when there was a study of the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and migration to species.
What is important, we compare and differentiate different HCoVs from a view of viral evolution and recombination of the genome.
Current CoV 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host transfers and the implications of viral evolution in the severity of the disease were also addressed.
Coronaviruses (CoV) belong to the Coronaviridae family, consisting of a group of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
← These viruses cover the largest genomes of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses have been referred to as ← CoVs — because of their morphology like crown under electron microscopes »
In structure, CoVs have genomes that are not segmented sharing similar configurations.
It is estimated that two-thirds of the genome contains two large compatible open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
Polyproteins are more processed to form 16 unstructured proteins, named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for protein structures, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some number of particular lines of accessory proteins are also encoded by various CoV lines.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where beta-CoV genera contain the most HCoVs and are divided into four lines (A , B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence showed that bats and rodents were serving as gene origin for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, as birds were the main storage of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continued to cross the boundaries of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
Today, seven human CoVs (HCoV) are known.
In these HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 typically undergo mild symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly referred SARS-CoV-2 are fully pathogenic, causing serious infections in the lower respiratory tract in relatively more patients with higher risk of acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the cold of patients with a common cold in the mid 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through extensive studies in HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which both cause self-defense symptoms.
In fact, the concept was widely adopted that infection in HCoVs was usually not harmful until the SARS outbreak.
The prevalence of SARS that took place in 2003 was one of the worst in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a starting death case of approximately 10%.
Ten years ago, the prevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with a random spread around the world.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-nCoV), which then replaced the name with SARS-CoV-2, was responsible for the agent of the ongoing epidemic of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19), which claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm is already sounding and the world has to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin from bats, rats or pets.
Many lines of evidence support an evolution that has all HCoVs originated from bats, where viruses are well suited and not pathogenic but show efficient genetic variation.
The COVID-19 epidemic showed a major challenge to medical, agham, society and morals in China and around the world.
Monitoring the zoonotic origin of HCoVs provides a framework to understand natural history, cause and factors of restriction on moving species.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for storage, intermediate and boosting(s) host animals of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for avoiding future scatterings.
In this poem we show a general view of zoonotic origin, transfer between species and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we focus on and discuss the common theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs are usually non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after contamination between species in a new host.
We also examine the pace of HCoV evolution in which the rate of transfer (transmissibility) often coincides with the decline of pathogenity or cause of disease.
The outcome of the ongoing spread of SARS-CoV-2 was also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the 1930s.
Prior to the first separation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nose juice of patients who had a common cold, various CoVs were isolated from different animal infections, including turkey, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
>>zsm_Latn<< A break summary of the history of HCoV Discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with infection in the upper respiratory tract in the year 1966, and later adapted to grow in the lines of the WI-38 lung cell.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed common cold symptoms, including headaches, fractures, sore sensation and swelling of throat, with fever and cough seen in 10~20% cases.
Basically in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial transfer to the brain of infant mice.
Clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to the causes of HCoV-229E, whose symptom is not identified from the infection of other respiratory tract pathogens such as viruses and flu Rhinovirus A.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world, and they are most likely transferred during the winter in temperate climate.
Often, the incubation period of these two viruses is lower in a week, followed by approximately 2-linggo disease.
According to a study with the volunteer person, the healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a gentle common cold.
Only a few immunopromised patients showed serious infection in the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS, also known as αα-atypical pneumonia α is the first well-documented cause of HCoV pandemic in human history and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered-
The first case of SARS can be traced in late 2002 to Guangdong Province of China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading in many countries and continents.
In addition to the loud spreaders, it was estimated that each case could narrow in approximately two secondary cases, with a time of hatching or incubation of 4 to 7 days and the viral load crack appears on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV were initially seen with myalgia, headaches, fever, malaise and trembling, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory stress as final symptoms.
lymphopenia, function tests of the damaged liver, and rise of the creatine kinase are common abnormalities in the SARS lab.
The breakdown of diffusion alveolar, spread of epithelial cell and rise of macrophages has also been observed in SARS patients.
Increasingly 20-30% of patients later need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower part of the respiratory tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney may also be infected in these more serious cases, usually accompanied by cytokinestorms, which may be fatal especially in patients with poor resistance to disease.
The virus was first separated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of the age patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, intense effort has been focused on HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7 month old child from the Netherlands in the latter part of 2004.
It was first found to be prevalent in children, in elderly and vulnerable patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common to HCoV-NL63 disease.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nose specimen from an 8-hundred boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is referred to in the Netherlands, it is actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 comprises approximately 4.7% of conventional respiratory diseases, and the breakdown of its scope occurs in the first part of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with a inflammatory throat disease, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from a 71-year-old male hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to having pneumonia and bronchiolitis acquired in the community, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be associated with chronic asthma progression.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 have been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four HCoVs acquired in the community have well adapted people and in general are more likely not to be mutated to cause high pathogenic diseases, even though accidents occur for unknown reasons such as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has only recently been reported to cause serious infection in the lower respiratory tract in China.
Often, when these HCoVs develop the ability to spread rapidly and remain continuously inside people, their virulent or pathogenicness is reduced.
MERS-CoV was first separated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had chronic pneumonia and kidney loss in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the cases confirmed in the laboratory came from the Middle East, import cases with occasional secondary spread in close relations were reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another second prevalence occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS, which are described by progressive chronic pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop chronic kidney loss, which is now unique for MERS in HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30% of patients have intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported to have a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
In the mid to late December 2019, rows of pneumonia patients who were recalled were known to have been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were referred to in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization announced the continued spread of infection in the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency Health Problem of the Whole World (Public Health Emergency of International Concern) and also called the disease COVID-19.
Up to March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases are signed around the world, with an estimated death case of 3.4%.
Interestingly, the case of Hubei's death, China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are seen as fever, cough and breathing difficulties.
The diarrhea has also been seen in some patients.
Pulmonya is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop in acute respiratory stress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are almost identical due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are aligned with different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but is more transmitted compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects or subjects that do not exhibit symptoms infected with SARS-CoV-2 are reported and may contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing and matching SARS-CoV-2 with other six other HCoVs reveals similarities and differences that are detectable.
First, the time of incubation or egg hatching and the duration of the HCoV disease course are almost the same.
Related to this, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms remains between SARS-CoV and the four acquired in the community HCoVs (ie HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are more often seen during infection in community-based HCoVs, including relating non-specific, mild or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of serious COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is somewhat lower.
Thirdly, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 also shows the identifiable patterns of the character of both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs acquired in the community.
On the one hand, the ability to move SARS-CoV-2 is equal to HCoV accesses in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be determined if the ability to be transferred by SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmissions to people such as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be referred to in the waste samples.
If excretion from waste to mouth (fecal-oral transmission) SARS-CoV-2 has an important role such as in the SARS-CoV case at least under certain events remains to be seen by future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 can show a moment-of-time as in cases of acquired HCoVs in the community.
Nevertheless, the highlights of SARS-CoV-2 along with its transfer capacity, pathogonity and remaining scattered after the transfers to humans can influence the final fate of the continued prevalence of COVID-19.
All four HCoVs acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms well suited people.
From another perspective, it can also be true that people are well suited to these four HCoVs.
In simple terms, the two may have originated from ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and the person who has had a serious HCoV disease has been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to be copied to people with enough scope to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that oppose host restriction factors to occur.
In this sense, the longer the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the steadily increasing number of people infected with it, the greater the chance that it perfectly fits people.
If it fits properly, its transfer to people will be difficult to prevent quantine or other steps in the control of infection.
For many years, the four CoVs acquired in the community are moving around human populations, which initiates the common cold in patients with normal response to the disease.
These viruses do not need a storage animal.
In contrast, excessive pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not fit people properly and their contamination within humans was not maintained.
They need to maintain and propagate their zoonotic reservoirs and look for the opportunity to move to susceptible target people, perhaps through one or more mediators and strengthening hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to the same SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs acquired in the community.
This is completely contagious like HCoVs that have acquired the community, at present.
Nevertheless, it causes more disease or more pathogenic than HCoVs in the community and is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen only if it is fully suited to humans and will move around people without a reservoir or intervention host.
Before discussing HCoV's animal origins, it will help us to discuss the meanings and characteristics of evolution, natural reservoirs, mediators and booster hosts of HCoVs.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of an HCoV if it will have a closely related ancestor sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestor virus usually fits smoothly and is not pathogenic in this host.
Also, a reservoir host contains HCoV continuously and for long term.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and HCoV's natural hosts or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was newly introduced to an intervention host before or in its introduction to people, it would not have adapted well to the new host and often pathogenic.
The intermediate host can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an increasing host by allowing the virus to be copied around and then transfer it to humans to increase the scope of human infection.
An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot maintain its contamination within the intervention host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also fit the intermediate host and further establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the mediator host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Looking back, epidemiological data has shown that the index case of SARS has a history of contact with animal charms.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher spread of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Masked palm civets (Meeting larvae) and racoon dogs in animal life markets were first identified with SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This is not directly supported by the fact that no additional SARS has been reported after all market musks are killed.
Nevertheless, it is reported that masked palm civets that come from forest or field without exposure to animal life in the market are clearly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets may serve only as mediator strengthening hosts but not natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV.
Interestingly, because 80% of the various animals in the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that many species of small mammals can also serve as mediators that strengthen SARS-CoV hosts are not isolated.
All of these appear to be head-end hosts of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search for the SARS-CoV natural host animal opened a close contact with the bat's CoV, called the SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoes.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequences of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat's CoVs are similar to 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology in SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
Many SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been referred to as coming from bats, but nothing but a named WIV1 can be separated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 that evolved from sample feces of bats was shown to use bat, mutton and human ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry.
Curiously, the sera of convalescent SARS patients has the ability to neutralize WIV1.
Today, WIV1 represents the closest relevant SARS-CoV ancestor to bats, sharing 95% of nucleotide sequence homology.
Even though the similarity between these two viruses is high, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservair host of SARS-CoV.
The evaluation phylogenetic includes MERS-CoV in the same team as CoV-HKU4 of bat's bat and CoV-HKU5 of bat.
CoV-HKU4 of bat and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dippedidyl peptidese 4 (DPP4), for viral access.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in bat's beta-CoVs referred to from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and the nearest relatives CoV-HKU25 of bat only share 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats may not be the nearest reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle Eastern studies have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, similar to camels that originated in the Middle East in many African countries.
MERS-CoV life similar to the virus found in humans will be separated from swabs in the noses of stermedary camels, which further indicates that camels serve as the definite reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
It is also interesting that general mild symptoms but massive viral spread have been observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
Interestingly, infected camels released viruses not only through the respiratory route but also through the contaminating route, which is also the main route for viral discharges from bats.
Nevertheless, questions remain because many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the symptom began, which may have been translated between people or unknown transfer routes involving unknown animal species with MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with CoV RaTG13 of bat separated from Rhinophus affinis bats.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence of variations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too high to consecrate the parent relationship.
That is, bats may not be the master(s) reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2 unless in the future the coV of the bat is about the same as.
Likely, the shared SARS-CoV-2 hosts should be among the species of wild animals purchased and killed at the Huan Seafood Wholesale Market, where many of the first cases of COVID-19 are related, indicating a possible occurrence of animal-to-human migration.
A few recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as panolins (Manis javanica) may also have arsor beta ancestral beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
New melolin CoV genomes share 85-92% homology sequence in SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identification at the nucleotide sequence level.
They combine with two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like virus in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identification.
In clear variation, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more different, even though homology sequence levels are higher in genomes.
An earlier study of pelvic sufferers also reported the discovery of viral contigs from lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study has adopted different methods of integration and manually-constructing to form a partial genome sequence consisting of an estimated 86.3% of the full length viral genome.
We can't isolate the possibility that melangolin is one of the shared host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, there is currently no evidence to support a direct root source of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence of separation between SARS-CoV-2 and termolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is much shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and marginal SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The path of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in bats, measles and other mammals remains stable.
While the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest sequence homology throughout the genome.
It is hard to imagine that the high level of uniformity between RBDs of panolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 causes evolutionary selectivity-mediated convergent.
An opposing scheme favors a recombination between a SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is prevalent in beta-CoVs.
The jury was not yet in the zoonotic master that originated the SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to high pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat's CoVs, as HCoV-OC43 virus parents and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
It has been reported that a CoV of bats called ARCoV.2 (the Appalachian Ridge CoV) referred to the North American tricolored bat showed a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is a genetic link to another CoV of bat, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, observed in Ghana, as camels are also suspected as its intermediate host.
For clarity, the current knowledge of animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for the events of the transfer between HCoV species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species that infected humans from pets in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E's interspecies transmission is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E were found.
Between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several lines of evidence support the direct transfer of the virus from bats to humans.
First, people but not alpacas may have had contact with bats in a shared ecological area.
Instead, people have close contact with alpacas.
Secondly, HCoV-229E associated with the alpha-CoV of bat is different and not pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV has caused the spread of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility cannot be denied that the alpacas obtained HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not too surprising that bats can pass HCoV-229E to humans directly.
As an alternative, even bats alpha-CoVs will serve as a gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels can serve as intermediate hosts that will transfer viruses to humans, exactly the same as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of moving between species from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolution that the MERS-CoV originated from bats was referred to its preliminary identification and was also strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich source of virus species for exchange between species of genetic fragments and transfer between species.
Life spans, mass colonies, close social interaction and high flying ability are desirable all improved conditions for bats to become a perfect 'viral spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.
It well suited these camels to move from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reserve host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its chance of infecting people is an accident and people remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV because it cannot maintain its contamination.
In contrast to the role of camels in MIRS-CoV's move, the role of fanlins, if any, is different from the transfer of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, the Panolin beta-CoVs are fully pathogenic in panolins.
They can be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the SARS-CoV case.
Some possibilities for the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans should be considered or not considered in future studies.
First, bats can be reservoir hosted by a SARS-CoV-2-related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Man may have shared ecologically appropriate space with bats by killing or mining coal.
Secondly, panolins may be one of the intermediate boosting hosts where a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 was newly introduced.
People get the virus by killing and eating the game meat.
It is possible that many mammals in which pets include are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of pets and wild animals for antibodies is needed.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third type associated with the same bats and pelvic.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origins is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main reasons for the viral side are also important in making it easier for CoVs to cross the boundaries of species.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
← Compared to other single-stranded RNA virus, the estimated number of mutations of CoVs can be regarded as ←kakatalaman » to - high-of-the-overage number of substitution ~ 10-4 substitution per year on each site 2, depending on the CoV phase of adaptation to the new hostings -
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, deletion results in too high mutation ability and be weakened or even useless.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress the transcription of CoV by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most reliable anti-sa-SARS-CoV-2 agents to test clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the levels of CoV mutations are about a million times higher than their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoVs do not suit the host properly.
Compared with SARS-CoV with high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate seems lower, suggesting a higher level of fit for humans.
It is probably suitable for other hosts near people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also fits in MERS-CoV, which well fits the dromedary camels.
In the theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will quickly depress vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in CoVs performs extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the possibility for shared evolution between different species, which is useful for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions have become appropriate.
It is supported by a repeated unique open-reading frame and protein-coded roles to the 3-[] end of the genome.
← Step three, CoVs are random and frequently transfer templates during RNA replication by a special-copy-choice - mechanism--
In a host that serves as a mixing vessel, the substitution of the strand occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Largely identical full and subgenomic RNAs can be recombined to form new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction associated with contamination
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another major factor that influences the transfer between species.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV was seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive selection as it moved between species.
Based on the comparative analysis between separated from humans and SARS-CoV of the muske, SARS-CoV is assumed to be subject to rapid fit for different hosts, especially in mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
Often, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV has an interaction with the cellular receptor and is strictly selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located in the 318th to the 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ACE2 as well as the coreceptors for viral access.
The RBD of SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors in various animals, including bats, worms, rats and raccoon dogs, which allow for viral transfer between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been observed to be different from humans and civet viral isolations in RBD and 4 of these have been seen in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which can increase the interaction of spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In simple terms, two substituents of amino acids can be important in viral fit people.
It is noteworthy that the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV cellular receptors are identical.
30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 unit S protein indicates that the bonding of its S protein with human ACE2 can be replaced.
In fact, a study of cryo-EM suggests a 10- to 20-tiplop higher affinity for this bonding than between human ACE2 and SARSCoV S protein.
It will also be an interest to determine if any other corepeptor is needed for the contamination of SARS-CoV-2.
Curiously, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but has another S component.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidese N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated cialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also report for the successful fit of these CoVs to humans after the contamination between species from their host animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of the transfer of HCoVs between species is also governed by other host interactions and restriction factors.
The diversity of these protein hosts between humans and natural reservair hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and animal pests can be a barrier to moving between species.
HCoVs need to remove host dependency factors and subvert host restriction promotes successful contamination between species.
Related to this, molecular determinants in this important area of viral-host interaction will remain referenced and described.
A fair screening of host support in all genomes and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology can be useful.
The emergence of new HCoVs: return to ground zero
The diversity of bat's CoVs provides many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat's CoVs serve as a gene pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also push the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to significantly change phenotype virals.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is considered essential to fit humans, because bat viruses associated with SARS-CoV are separated but found to encode divergents ORF8 proteins.
The characteristic removal of 29-nucleotide of SARS-CoVs was found in strains isolated at the start of the human epidemic.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the change of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with the origins of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The locations of recombination have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and nsp14 components.
Also, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic experienced episodes of recombination between different clans, which took place on the dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, phenomena of recombination have also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs recombined with other animal CoVs in their non-structured genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to accidental changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from the detonation of viruses from selection pressures, such as host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-long ORF4 in HCoV-229E prototype strain, due to a two-nucleotide removal.
As the intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, resulting in a frameshift.
Last but importantly, the evolution of new HCoVs is also caused by the pressure to select their reservoir hosts.
No symptom or mild symptoms have been observed only when CoV bats have been infected, indicating the uniformity between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats are well suited to CoVs in relation to anatomy and physiology.
For example, pro-inflammatory response impairments in bats have effectively reduced the cause disease initiated by CoV.
In addition, the inherent killing of cell activity in bats has been inhibited by the unprejugation of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low levels of expression of key histocompatibility complex class I of molecules.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed from high metabolic activity of bats can be relieved to control the replication of CoV and affect proofreading through exoribonuclease, thus giving selection pressure for the generation of viral strains that is over-theogenic when introduced to a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains can also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Thus, the three new HCoVs appeared in the past two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They respond quickly without taking a strong host immune response.
Here the secrets lie why there are visible asymptomatic carriers and what results in the severe case of human infection.
Serious symptoms are mainly caused by hyperactivity of the immune response and the cytokinestorm where the more severe the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary damage.
On the contrary, to carriers without symptoms, immune response has been prevented from doubling CoV transcription.
The same discharte in removing resistance response can have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the management of type I interferon in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is defective.
By this analogy, restraining NLRP3 inflammasome using MCC950 can be beneficial in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme in which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from.
While a beta-CoV of bat is referred to sharing 95% of nucleotide homology in SARS-CoV, there is also a CoV of bat sharing 96% nucleotide homology in SARS-CoV-2.
Because civets and other market animals have been found to have viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the intermediaries hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs which are notablely similar or homologous in SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that Pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts or the beta-CoVs can contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either intentionally or unintentionally.
CoVs returned to limelight due to the recent spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has rapidly changed our understanding of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservairs of HCoVs in human contamination.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have evolved from bats and have been transferred to humans through host intermediates.
Because of SARS-CoV infection has evolved from contact between people and civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing civets there can effectively end the SARS epidemic.
With the same reasoning, panolins should be removed from markets to avoid zoonotic contamination, due to the discovered many lines of panolin beta-CoV closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 can be transferred to humans by pamolins and other mammals remain transparent in future inspections.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has already existed in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important tool for transportation as well as the main source of meat products, milk, leather and wool for local people.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the repetitive spread of MERS, a comprehensive approach must be taken to form effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, along with other infection control measures.
Because we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear to cause outbreaks.
There are various zoonotic CoVs moving through the forest.
In particular, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are different.
There are many instances when these zoonotic CoVs change and re-unite, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more infectious and/or deadly to people in the future.
The eating culture of wild animals in some areas of China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the difficulties of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They stayed in their own natural containers until they had an opportunity to overflow.
Even though bats have many features that favor the spread of viruses, the opportunity to connect humans with bats and other wild animals can be lowered if humans are taught to get rid of them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human contamination and future prevalences.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological sites of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Some pieces in the zoonotic puzzle background of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats caused a SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to be present in the merodins, it is interesting to see in what events bats can divide and breed the same ecologically appropriate site.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in infecting humans, the contamination of people from bats should be appropriate.
Third, if the third mammal is to be a true intermediate host, it needs to be made clear how it interacts with different species including people, bats and turtles.
Finally, because many mammals include pets that can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, the same monitoring and experimental infection must be done.
Whether it is a bat, petolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical will be identified in future natural hosts.
Continued inspections in this section will explain the path of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with significant implications for prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.

In December 2019, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused a prevalence, now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named as a single acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2).
On the 11th of March 2020, COVID-19 was introduced by WHO as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide and was published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
This has attracted much attention ever since it was published.
But remember that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge gradually rise based on ongoing findings in clinical training research and experience; therefore, dikartes of diagnosis and treatment are also continued mother-update.
For example Diagnosis Guidelines and Treatment for COVID-19 released by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), on 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, released a total of seven editions with some contexts of considerable change.
Now our guide received an overview of Zhou et al., they introduced a proposal for simple marking based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence for our guidance and also made an important consultation for the global prosecution.
We support their meaningful work and express our gratitude.
Nevertheless, their work also requires up-to-date according to the latest Analysis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Testing the seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to sign the suspected case it is necessary to combine any aytem of highlights of epidemiological history and two aytems of clinical inferences to make a comprehensive analysis, or to meet three aytems of clinical inferences without clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: Epidemiological history of the epidemiological case: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported on the last 14 days before the symptom began; (2) a history of contact with the infected case SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive diagnosis of nucleic residence); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or symptoms of breathing from the city of Wuan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported on the last day before the symptoms began; (4) a complic history of culumency in case 2 /22 cases of shocks, or post-rematory symptoms of office, etc.
Clinical manifestations: Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with highlights imaging of COVID-19 infection; (3) total number of white blood cells showing normal, reduced, or decreased lymphocytes in the first stage of onset.
>>zsm_Latn<< Diagnosing the conditioned case should base on suspected case with any one item of pathogenic or serological Evidence as following: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral double genome sequencing high homogeneity to the known novel coronviruses; (3) positive for the specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in serum; or a change of the SARS-Co-2sicicive photo from Igregative antibody to the positive, ignating negativeive to the riskive in the phage.
We can see that the real-time PCR testing for acidic nuclei in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) edition.
The discovery of pathogen in the blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) edition; and then the serolohical evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers to search for a best kit of acid nucleic detection for rapid analysis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including the blood sampling, which have increased the presence of different specimens, and are supported bringing a definite positive antibody outcome to the signed standard.
In addition, more and more evidence warns us to be careful of patients who are not-commonly symptomatic and asymptomatic.
← Uprightly, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be up-update, because they classified the person without clinical symptoms as » the risk will be low -
The point system also needs to be proven in additional clinical activity and learning.
In conclusion, we expect more direct evidence to come and call readers to give their observations.

Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, most in one day
Yesterday, Bangladesh signed that there were five new deaths due to COVID-19 that day.
It is the highest number of deaths a day from germs.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) wrote the number of delayed infected cases that included 114 active cases and 33 cases of recovery where it remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news directive, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, mentioned among the deaths were four men and a woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases are aged 60 up, two are between 51 and 60, and one 41-50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 was a pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told the Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, who was one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video press, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader stated that the public vehicle would stop work longer than it had been planned, until it came Saturday.
The closure of public transportation was first started on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Traveling important goods -- medical, fuel and food -- still allowed.
The first recorded events of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were on March 8, on two people who came home from Italy and also ganun the wife of one of them.
On March 19, these three were healed.
SARS-CoV-2 has already passed one million worldwide infections
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus cases exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Not less than 52 thousand deaths are linked to COVID-19, the coronavirus division disease.
The significant event came on the same day that Malawi signed his first coronavirus infections and Zambia gained his first death in connection with the coronavirus.
North Korea, on Thursday, claimed that it was one of the few countries that remained free of coronavirus contaminations.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 signed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand coronavirus cases have been recorded, in conjunction with an average of 5,900 dead.
CBS News, referring to Johns Hopkins University data, reported that there were over 1,000 US deaths on Wednesday half of coronavirus contaminations.
Worldwide, countries have advertised more rigorous methods for preventing the spread disease.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown to May 1.
Throughout the country, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russian citizens would continue to pay off even if they did not enter the work until April 30.
Portugal' parliament voted to prolong the national emergency of 15 days; the consensus vote had 215 votes in favor, ten non-committed, and a counter vote.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that lasted all day; before, the curfew was only valid between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced that the state extended the order stay-at-home to May 1.
Australian stores limit to toilet paper per transaction
On Sundays and Saturday evenings, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their restrictions on buying bathroom paper on two and one packs per transaction to all stores throughout the country, each.
The ALDI also opened up the one-packet limit, on Monday.
These limitations are encoded as messages on checkouts, and on chain Facebook pages.
Consumers are reported to store because of fear of COVID-19 if people have to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the available toilet paper for home delivery to a package per order.
These changes followed the past four-na-package per transacty restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
← Coles, released by the media on March 8, reported that in the set four package restrictions, » many stores still sell for an hour of delivery » and call the command » not to occur » as ALDI, on a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it » unexplored »
← sales have risen ← peak rise - last week, according to a spokeswoman of Woolworths ←
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packets last week.
To relieve the shortage further, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and delayed delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI wasstocking for planned Wednesdays which was specially available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Association of Australyns, said that the inspectors were trying to raise the goods, but the restrictions of the local council were difficult to make on the weather of truck delivery.
He expects rising production costs, because suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer specials.
On Tuesday, ALDI declared that following the early withdrawal of goods, there were other stores that could not run the further Wednesday special.
In the News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, expert in eye contact from the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill a shelf every night.
He mentions that the toilet paper is a large item, which leads to low amounts of stocks, and, when purchased all, leaves wide space on shelves, adding to the sense of lack.
← Sina Coles and Woolworths have a view of [that] if there are many items on the shelf, if the product such as toilet rolls and satisfactors can [can be purchased] and many, you may be able to reduce the panic ? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The creator of the self-recycle booklet paper Who Gives a Crap said they had run out of stock last Wednesday.
The Kimberly-Clark, which produces the Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and the Solaris Paper that makes Sorgent, has given the impression that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported several vendors offering free toilet paper on the first bidder in Melbourne auctions, with fewer auctions held because consumers had time not to work during the long end of the Workers' Day or Labour Day week.
The edition Thursday of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, combined with a note with eight pages to be folded and used as a toilet paper.
Stores were originally reluctant to enforce restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 where they said they had no plan to put restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman urged that other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry merchandise, hand washing and flour, were also high.
Also, outside Australia, on Sunday evening the online British supermarket Ocado observed limiting the purchases of Andrew toilet paper in two 12 roll packs.
The World Health Organization's pandemic declared COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) supported the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — which is a pandemic.
← While the word »pandemia » refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, it does not refer to how dangerous the definite cases are, WHO cited the need to push governments to take action:
\"All nations are still able to change the course of this pandemic.\"

He went on, - and we haven't seen a bakery in the past that can be controlled by the cyclical ? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The new status as a pancreas follows WHO's inauguration in January to declare the outbreak of emergency health to the public to be remembered internationally.
>>zsm_Latn<< The United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's director, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, ←bottom line, it's going to get going through the work »
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there would be no less than 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronary pancreas is a continuous pandemic of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19), causing severe chronic respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019, which was declared to be an Emergency in Public Health (Public Health Emergency) World Memory (International Concern) on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
Until 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in an estimated 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people were healed.
The vicious killer of the case is estimated to be 4% in China, while covering the world from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and diarrhea.
Complications may include pneumonia and syndrome of chronic respiratory disease (acute respiratory stress syndrome).
It is typical for five days the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms, but it can last from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or reference antiviral treatment.
Symptomatic and support therapy is the primary treatment.The proposed prevention step includes washing hands, touching the mouth of one’s own mouth when coughing, maintaining distance with another person, and monitoring and self-explanation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quantine, curfew, workplace risk control, and the closure of the facility.
The pancreas has led to serious disruptions of social life around the world, the delay or dismissal of games, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread deficiencies of tools exacerbated by panic music.
Schools and universities are closed on either national or local basis in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's students population.
Misinformation about microbes spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other people of the East and the clan of South-Single Asya, and others from areas with meaningful microbio cases.
Reduced travel and closure of heavy industries have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pulmonary cases unknown to the cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in the first part of January 2020.
Cases usually have links to the Huan Seafood Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin or originated from the animal and was translated into man.
The virus caused by the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely associated with bat coronviruses, melolin coronviruses, and SARS-CoV. The previous known person with symptoms was later found to become ill on 1 December 2019 , and that person was not exposed to visible connections in the market group later.
In the early number of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds associated with the market were found.
On March 13, 2020, an uncertain report from the South China Morning Post was proposed that a case observed on November 17, 2019, in a 55 year old from Hubei province, might have been the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases reported to have been rejected in China but suddenly added to Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of China hit the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be significant insufficient reporting of cases, particularly those with a milder symptom.
By 26 February, there were few cases reported to young people, in about 19 downs forming 2.4% of cases worldwide. United Kingdom science principal Patrick Vallance was estimated that 60% of the British population had to be infected before effective herd immunity was achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people diagnosed in COVID-19, and confirm that their analysis is positive according to official protocols.
Until 23 March, no country had yet examined more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to examine only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, to January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 was estimated that the number of infections in Italy was greater than reported cases.
Initial quantifications of basc reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 are 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not, the time from showing symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, most commonly living 14 days.
Until April 10 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19.
In China, up to February 5 about 80% of death is in more than 60, and 75% have prior health conditions including cardiovascular and diabetes diseases.The official death list from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to dead people diagnosed with COVID positive according to official protocols.
The number of virtual deaths from COVID-19 may be higher, because the dead may not be counted. at home, in carehouses, etc.
It was learned from the parliamentary data from Italy that the number of extreme deaths during the pancreas was beyond the official death toll on the COVID factor of 4-5x.
>>zsm_Latn<< A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged — We know that [the stated death toll] is an underestimation - a statement corrobated by anecdotal reports of undertaking in the U.S. Such underestimation often occus in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epiemic.The first confirmedath instead of Wuhan on 9 January 2020-
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asya was in France on 14 February.
By February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica. Some measures were commonly used to count mortality.
These figures vary according to the region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of test, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time from the preliminary outbreak, and characteristics of the population such as age, gender, and general health.The ratio of death figures in the number of cases reflects the number of deaths divided in the number of diagnosed cases within the time interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the world rate of death in the case was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) until 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to region.
In China, estimates for the rate of death rate in the case rate have been reduced from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms from after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the number of death or case fatality rate (CFR), which analyzes the percentage of people who have been diagnosed from the disease or infaction fatality rate (IFR), which analyzes the percentage of the infected (diagnosed and non-diagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are timeless and follow a definite population from contamination to case solving.
The number of academics attempted to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford estimates that the number of deaths in the infection for the pancreas as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above estimate of this evaluation is consistent with the results from the first stream of testing or random testing for COVID-19 in Germany, and in statistical studies that assess the impact of testing on CFR assessments.
WHO believes the pancreas can be controlled.
The rumbling and longest starting is uncertain and can vary from location to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State's Homeland, said, \"If not checked, infectious bursts will usually reach the top and begin to decline after the host has no available hosts.

The flood of return to the safety of the flock and the extent of the change is shared.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively uncertain and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory spasum (plema), loss of smell, nausea, muscle pain and joint, swollen throats, headaches, trembling, vomiting, bleeding, diarrhea, or skin rashes. WHO states that more than one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists symptoms such as respiratory difficulties, chronic pain or chest pressure, sudden confusion, awakening difficulty, and nursing face or lips; counseling master medical attention if there are these symptoms. Further progressions of the disease may lead to serious pneumonia, acute respiratory dystress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results proving infection, so the researchers issued the advice that those with close contact with the confirmed infected person should be carefully monitored and checked to prevent infection.
Chinese questioned asymptomatic ratio covered from a few to 44%.
The typical incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranged from one to 14 days; it was usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, tattooing a small portion of people with COVID-19 who lost their smell was initialized 30% and fell by 15% later.
Some details about how the disease is spread are still being cited.
The disease is believed to be primarily spread in close contact and with a small drop drop from coughing, breaking, or speaking; with a close contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that a drill without cover can release small drops that travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have thought that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets that remain in the air for a long time, which can be formed by speaking.The tiny drops in the open air can also form at the time of breath-breathing, including speech, even if the virus is not actually contained by the air.
Small drops can reach the mouths or noses of people who are close or can be suffocated into the lungs.
Some medical techniques such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory juices to float into the air and then lead to air exposure.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, includes the skin, and then holds their eyes, nose, or mouth.
As there are concerns that it can spread through human waste, this danger is believed to be low.
Government China has denied the possibility of tat-able transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The microbio is most contagious within the first three days after symptoms begin, even though the spread may be before symptoms come out and in the final stages of the disease.
People who have been diagnosed positive in the disease for up to three days before symptoms appear are suggested that transmission is possible before the formation of meaningful symptoms.
Few reports exist in cases that do not exhibit symptoms signed by the lab, but transfer without symptoms has been identified by some countries while investigating contact escape.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) promises that as long as it is not fully clear how easily the disease is spread, a person in general is infected with two to three others. The virus lives for several hours or days on touched objects.
Sure enough, the microbe was found to be visible for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on the cardboard, and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, is updated based on humidity and temperature.CoVID-19 is diagnosed positively with animal favorites and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can pass germs on to humans, though British authorities advise washing hands after touching animals, such as after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a microbio novel, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in conjunction with the cluster of severe respiratory disorders in Wuhan cases.
All characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in conjunction with coronaviruses in nature . Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by soapy household use, which dissolves in its ballot defence. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS- CoV.
It was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronaviruses are genetically conglomerated in the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two derived-spain strains.
It is 96% identical to the level of the entire genome in other bats' colavavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers learned that there is only one difference between amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between viruses from measles and from humans.
The whole-genome comparison has so far found about 92% of the genetic material similar to the melolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that pelvic hosts are intermediate.
Microbial infection can be first diagnosed based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimatum that by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study that compared PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is meaningfully more sensitive than PCR, even less certain, with many highlights of its imaging that will depend on other pulmonary and disease processes.
← Until March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends » The CT should not be used to be screened for or as a first-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19 »
WHO published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, releasing the first on January 17.
Analysis uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The analysis can be done in respiratory or blood samples.
Results can be obtained in general for several hours to several days.
In general, this analysis is carried out by rubbing inside the nose or nasopharyngeal swab even though rubbing inside the throat or throat swab can also be used. Some labs and commissions make up the serological analyses, which see antibodies.
Up to April 6, 2020, none of these proved to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the US a serological test developed by Cellex is approved for emergency use of only certified labs.
The characteristics of ionizing radiography and compact tomography (CT) of people with markers include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural efffusions.
The Italian Radiological Society has compiled an international online database of informed know-hows in confirmed cases.
With overlap to other infections such as adenovirus, there is limited certainty in the recognition of COVID-19 the imaging without PCR confirmation.
A major study in China compared the results of the Chest CT to PCR and showed that even practice is less particular for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a filtering tool in epidemic areas.
Artifacts based-sa-wise convolutional neural networks were developed to see the highlights of microbiography with the same radiographs and CT.
Methods to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining general good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding contact with the eyes, nose or mouth of unsanitary hands, and coughing or breaking tissue straight into the trash container.
Those who may already have an infection are advised to wear a chirrical mask in the public.
Physical distancing has also been recommended, and many governments have put pressure on or have warned against unnecessary travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
Nevertheless, microbes have reached the period of community spread in large parts of the world.
This means that microbes are spreading within communities, and are not known where or how they have infected some of the community members.Providers of health care that care for a person who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.The monitoring of contact is an important way for health authorities to identify the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from governments' mobile phones for this desire has prompted memories of privacy, along with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations that issue a statement that has called limitations on this type of surveillance.
It has been implemented or proposed for voluntary use of various mobile apps, and up to April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups work in tender-to-private solutions, such as using Bluetooth to spawn a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users can receive a message if they are close to interacting with a person who has been diagnosed positively with COVID-19.The wrong idea about how to avoid infection; for example, nose-rinsing and muthwashing is ineffective.
There is no vaccine of COVID-19, even though many organizations work to form one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the cube or if seeing the hands dry; before eating; and after brewing a own nose, coughing, or breaking.
This is due to the outside of the human body, the virus is killed by the soap used in the home, which fired its protective bubble.
The CDC further recommended the use of hand sanitizers that contain alcohol with only 60% alcohols according to volume when not getting soap and water immediately.
WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth in unsanitary hands.
Tops of multiple solutions can be cleaned up (in a minute of exposure to the disinfectant for the stailes steel surface), along with a 62–71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chrohexidine glucone, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if suspected of having a COVID case or signing a facility such as office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, general areas, electronic use sharings such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by human patients, should be infected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or tissue when coughing or drying, and quickly discard any tissue.
Silicon masks are recommended for those who may be infected, because mask use can limit the amount and distance of moving small drops while speaking, whistling, and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
← According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist of the University of Leeds, ← The wearing of masks can reduce the habit [of] people to hold their faces, which is a major source of infection if there is no appropriate hand hygiene - The masks are also recommended to be used by people who care for a person who may be ill -
WHO recommends that healthy people wear masks only when they are at high risk, like people who care for a person with COVID-19, even though they also recognize that wearing masks may help people to avoid touching their face.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of public members' masks.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made of cloth. China specifically recommends the use of disposabols which are medical masks of healthy public members, especially in close-up integration (1 meters or 3 feet or closer) to other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when riding public transportation or staying in crowded areas.
Thai health officials persuade people to make facemask fabrics at home and to waste it every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited the release of the public without wearing a mask or covering a person’s nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear face masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government ordered that everyone entering a grocery store should wear face mask.
Israel asked all residents to wear face masks when outside.
Taiwan, which was able to produce ten million masks daily starting in mid March, ordered in suburban railways and buses to wear face masks on 1 April.
Panama has made it to replace masking every time it goes outside, as it also recommends making a homemade mask for those who can't buy masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social disannuncing (also known as physical distancing) is accompanied by action in controlling infection with the purpose of slowing the spread of the disease by reducing the close contact of the individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas, or shopping centers.
Individuals can implement the means of distance (social distancing) by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and physically isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are now ordering or documenting social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The largest gathering measure recommended by the US to government representatives and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if no known prevalence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and then 10 people.
On the 22nd of March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings beyond two people. Older and ill people such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, abnormal hypertension, and poor immune system posed a greater risk of severe illness and complications and CDC was advised to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreaks.In late March 2020, WHO and other health representatives were introduced to the use of the term -social distancincincence - physicalism is intended to be physically integrated as long as social attachments have been made to virtually linked.
The use of the term αsocial distancing α has led to the implications that people should participate in complete social separation, rather than persuade them to stay in touch with others by alternative means.Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health for use during the pancreatic period.
It includes recommendations to have sex only with the person you are at home, with no virus or virus symptoms.
Home isolation is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation.Many governments have ordered or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions were issued for high risk groups.
Advice is given to those who may be exposed to a person with COVID-19 and only those who have recently traveled to a country or region with a wide transmission to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The control strategies of an outbreak are control or control, and recovery.
Preventing early stages of outbreak and aiming to identify and separate infecteds as well as to initiate other methods of control of infection and vaccines to stop the outbreak of disease in the remaining population.
If the spread of the disease is no longer preventable, efforts will be moved in the period of relief: measures will be taken to slow the spread and ease its effects on the health and social care system.
A combination of the same measures of control can be performed at the same time as damaging and relaxing.
Control requires more severe measures to combat the pancreas by reducing the average rate of reproduction to less than 1. Part of the management of the outbreak of an infectious disease the test to reduce the epidemic's rumbling, known as the binding of the epidemic curve.
It reduces the risk of excessive health services and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-partistic interventions that can govern the bursting include personal measures of prevention, such as hand hygiene, masking-sa-mukha, and self-quarantine; community measures that aim for physical sanitation (physical distancing) such as shutting schools and canceling events at large gatherings; community ties to induce acceptance and involvement in natural interventures; as well as environmental proposals such as cleanup above.Criminal acts that repressively inhibit China's rapidity is the apparent emphasis on the entire city's travel and strictness.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting microbial bursts.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quadrantines, and gave warnings for the operation of infected indibidwals.
Singapore provided financial assistance for people who were infected and subjected themselves to quarantine and imposed a large fine on people who did not.
Taiwan added face mask production and fined illegally hiding medical supplies.The simulations for Great Britain and the United States showed that weakening (slowing but not stopping the epidemic's spread) and bullying (reversed epidemiological growth) had major challenges.
Optical recovery policies can reduce the need for health care by 2/3 and die by half, but will still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and fullness of health systems.
Repression or oppression may be chosen but it needs to be maintained until the virus is spread to the human population (or until a vaccine is developed, if it comes first), because infection on the other side will quickly return when the steps are released.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pancreas causes social and economic costs.
There are no particular antiviral drugs that are appropracticed for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to form, along with the examination of those already available drugs.
Drinking cold medication that is bought without prescription, drinking liquids, and rest may help cure symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be needed.
The use of steroids can aggravate the consequences.
Many compounds that have been infected previously for the treatment of other viral diseases have been investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also stated that some α-traditional and home remedies α can provide relief to the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19-
The increase in capacity and dependability in health-cares for the needs of COVID-19 patients was described by WHO as the main response step in the burst.
The ECDC and the European regional office of WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and services in basic health care for the replacement of resources in mass levels, along with the focus of laboratory services to the examination of COVID-19, canceling the elective procedures as much as possible, separation and isolation of positive patients in COVID-19, and raising abilities in intensive care of staff and increasing access to fans and beds.
There are various theories about where the earliest case (the so-called patient zero) could have originated.
The first known case of novel coronavirus can be re-introduced on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei grew slowly.
The majority of these are based on the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, who also sold animal life, and one kuru-kuro was that the microbiyo came from one of these animals; or, in other words, it originated from the animal. A cluster of pulmonary not referred to the reason was observed on December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wakin Jiang CDC on December 27.
← On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital gave a warning to their colleagues of a 3–mala-SARS coronicirus »
Eight of these doctors, along with Li Wenliang, were told by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was criticized by his superiors for the rise of the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued an appeal to the public on 31 December and informed WHO.
Enough cases of unidentified pneumonia were reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate inspection at the beginning of January.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases almost doubled every seven and a half days.
In the first and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinan provinces, aided by the migration-to-country in the New Year of Chinese and the Wuhan transportation center and main trainship.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Time and again official data shows that 6,174 people had symptoms by the time of January 20, 2020. By March 26, the United States had passed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.Hunging April 9, 2020, over 1.61 million cases were reported around the world; over 97,000 people were killed and over 364,000 were recovered.
There has not been a drop in a case around 200 countries and territories.
Because of the European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen Area held back free movement and placed border controls.
National reactions include control measures such as quarantine (known as stand-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns) and curfews. Until 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or nearly 90% of the population, have been subjected to some form of lockdown in the United States, over 50 million people are in the lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people are on the lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are on the India's lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were subjected to some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion people after two days - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was tracked back on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unsigned report suggests that the first case was on 17 November.
Doctor Zheng Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases unknown to the cause on December 26, in which his hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
The preliminary analysis of the genetic patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated that there was a long-SARS coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31 eliminated a public notice.

Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) have been canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of the temporary hospital, Huushenshan Hospital, completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built afterward, the Leishenshan Hospital, to take care of additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities to Wuhan, such as convention and stadium centers, which were temporary hospitals.On January 26, the government established additional measures to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19, including the investigation of health announcements for travelers and long-term vacationing in Spring Feast.

- Public action control is carried out in many cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) are faced with some kind of external restriction.After the outbreak of its worldwide phase in March, China authorities have taken strict measures to avoid microbibes from αα-imprecisive ααα αα from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day preaching quantine law for all world travelers entering the city.On 23 March, only one case in mainland China infected the area for the previous five days, this time by traveling back to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases moved into the country was actually blocked and controlled the outbreak of China.
On the same day the restrictions on travel in Hubei, except for Wuhan, were relieved two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on March 26, 2020 that the entry for visas or residency holders would be inspired from March 28 onwards, and there were no definite details as to when this policy would be completed.

It is confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a meaningful rise in signed cases on February 20, more than anything related to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known by the name Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected of the origin of the outbreak.
On February 22, of 9,336 church followers, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 signed cases were reported in Korea, which rose to 3,150 on February 29.
South Korea's military bases were all quarantine after the investigations confirmed that three soldiers had been positive to the microbiyo.
The aircraft schedules were also affected and therefore changed. South Korea introduced what is considered the world's largest and best organized program to screen the population for the microbe, and separate any infected person as well as monitoring and quarantitating their contacts .
The filtering methods include mandatory voluntary reporting of symptoms through new internationals that have come through mobile application, drive-thru testing for the virus that has a result the next day, and increasing test ability to test up to 20,000 people daily.
South Korea's program has been considered successful as a success in preventing the outbreak of the despite the non-quarrantine of all cities . South Korea's body was initially improved by the response to the President Moon Jae-in crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions either called for the impeaching of Moon in their claim of government misinjury in bursting, or praising his response.
On March 23, South Korea was reported to have the lowest one-day case in a total of four weeks.

Shia's altars at Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of microbial spread after China in February.
Among the claims of covering the area of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries are monitoring their cases back to Iran on February 28, suggesting that the extent of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government on that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly assessed positively on the microbibe on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Monitoring (Human Rights Watch) urged Iranian prison authorities to release human rights defenders who were imprisoned for peaceful conflict, and to release all deserving prisoners temporarily as well.
It stated that there was a greater risk of microbial spread to closed institutions such as patent centers, which also lacked sufficient medical care.

The laboratory analysis for respiratory disease coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include techniques that de-detected the presence of the virus and people who de-detected antibodies created in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is signed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
The analysis is specific and only designated to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
This is used to sign the most recent or active infections.
The discovery of antibodies (serology) can be used equally for population analysis and observation.
Antibodies have shown how many people have had the disease, including people whose symptoms are too simple to report or people who have not shown symptoms.
The accurate mortality rate and the level of immuneity of the human group in the population can be identified from the results of this analysis.
Because of limited analysis, until March 2020 no countries have reliable data for the spread of microbes in their population.
On March 23, no country examined more than 3% of their population, and there was extensive innovation of how much analysis has to be conducted throughout the countries.
This variation may have a significant impact on the level of reported death cases, which are likely to be widely estimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) analysis can be performed in respiratory samples obtained from various methods, including rubbing inside the nose or nasopharyngeal swab or sample of the dura or sputum sample.
The results are generally available for several hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR analysis using rubbing throats or throat swab can only be expected during the first week of illness.
Over time the virus can disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply the lungs.
For human infections examined in the second week, alternative sample material can be carried out from deep airways via a suction catheter or can use a drilling device (dura).
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and laid the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom of the study also developed on January 23, 2020. The Kogenebiotech council in South Korea also formed a clinical grade, detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) for the SaRS-CoV-2 based on PCR on January 28, 2020.

One of the three genetics analysis of older versions of the examination kits has produced undesirable results due to return errors, and a verbal analysis of the CDC in Atlanta; this has resulted in less than 100 samples per day successfully processed as a whole of February 2020.
It was not specified that tests using two components could be relied upon until February 28, 2020, and it was not until the state and local labs were allowed to begin examination.
The analysis was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization.Us commercial labs began the examination during the early days of March 2020.
Starting on March 5, 2020 LabCorp announced the availability across the world of COVID-19 analysis based on RT-PCR.
The Quest Diagnostics conducted a similar nationwide analysis of CoVID-19 starting on March 9, 2020.

On February 11, 2020 the diagnosis was registered by the Federal Service for Monitoring Health Care.On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic who developed a diagnosis to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, the Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for analysis that could be carried out for 3.5 hours in high volume, so the machine was allowed to do an estimated 4,128 test in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA gave emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for analysis of the Abbott's m2000 system; recently the FDA has proposed similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, the Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for examination that lasted 45 minutes.
FDA approved analysis using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology rather than PCR.
Because it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles this method can deliver positive results in just five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects a rise in stuttering to deliver 50,000 tests per day.The analysis using monoclonal antibodies specifically connecting the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of novel coronavirus has been developed in Taiwan, hoping it can give results for 15 to 20 minutes such as rapid influenza analysis.

Part of the response to the resistance to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detecte infection indibidwals starting at 7 days or more after symptoms, for identification of immunity, and population monitoring.The assays can be performed in laboratory centers (CT) or at point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Automated systems with high outcomes in many clinical laboratories can perform these assays but their availability depends on the production level for each system.
For CLT, the single specimen for whole blood or peripheral blood is commonly used, even if serial specimens can be used to follow immune response.
For PoCT the single blood specimen is usually obtained by piercing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods the cutting step was not required before the assay.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities who gave the agency an abbreviation as required and now has the ability to distribute their antibody tests.
Starting on April 7, 2020, only single tests were approved by the FDA under the authorization of emergency use.In the late days of March 2020, the Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received permission for their test kits, which could detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The analysis capacity is several hundred samples for several hours and is therefore faster than the Conventional PCR assay viral RNA.
Usually seen on 14 days of antibodies after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK learned that there was not enough efficient use in the antibody screening kits it bought.

Drive-through centers helped South Korea do some of the fastest and most extensive investigations of any country . In Germany, the National Association of Statatory Health Insurance Physicians spoke on March 2, that it had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day on ambulatory methods and 10,700 were diagnosed in the first week.
The cost will be maintained in health insurance when the examination is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Starting March 19 inspections while inside the vehicle were offered in large cities.
Starting on March 26, 2020 the total number of tests conducted in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
The first lab survey revealed that beginning in the 12/2020 calendar week the estimated total of 483,295 was diagnosed to and included the week of 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested positively in SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers developed and analyzed the process of analyzing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by collecting samples and only reassessing if the combined sample was learned positively. Wakin was done for a temporary 2000-acretetricated surgically called-Hunes: Chinees, or 6¢, could have been processed for more than 20 days.

The lab has the ability to perform ten thousand RT-PCR tests per day formed within 14 days and the world's leading scale to operate outside China.
Various analysis recipes that targeted various components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization used the German recipe for painting kits sent to small countries with no resources to form their own kits.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control for Disease Control was not available until January 28, which combined tests available to the U.S.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits in the early spread of the disease, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the need and recommendations for health experts' analysis.
In contrast, experts say that the extensive availability of a South Korean study has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The capacity of analysis that is mostly in private lab sectors has been built for almost a few years through the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization was called to start testing programs as the best way to slow down the growing COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for diagnosis due to the widespread spread of the virus that caused the fusions thousands of examinations in U.S. private labs, and supply supplies of the swab and chemical substance failed.
In March 2020 China reported problems with the accuracy of their test kits.
← In the United States, there are - bahids - the examination kits developed by the CDC; so the government removed bureaucrat barriers that prevented private testing . Spain purchased check kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results were not accurate-
The company explained that the wrong results may be the result of false collecting samples or misuse of kits.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove kits that returned the wrong results, and replace them with other check kits given by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits bought by the Czech Republic from China gave the wrong result.Slova bought 1.2 million test kits from China that were not properly informed.

Analysis, followed by aquaratine of testers positive and monitoring the interactions of positive people with SARS-CoV-2, which led to positive outcomes.
Researchers working in the town of Vò, the site of the first to die at COVID-19 in Italy, conducted a two-fold investigation of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with ten days apart.
About half of the people surveyed who were positive did not have symptoms, and all the cases that were hurt were subjected to quarantine.
Traveling in an emergency area, it completely reduces new infections.
By aggressive monitoring of contact, restricting entry travel, analysis, and quarantination, the other developed countries have gradually continued with 2020 coronavirus pandemics in Singapore, but there are no strong restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began counseling residents to stay home on March 28, but schools were reopened on the appointed time after the vacation on March 23.
Some of the other countries managed the pancreas through vigorous contact tracing, restrictions on travel to enter the country, analysis, and quarantitine, but there were lower aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
The statistical study found out that countries had multiple analyzed, associated with the number of deaths, had a lower rate of death cases, perhaps because these countries were more capable of detecting those with no severe symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no diagnostic abilities and the national lab with limited COVID-19 experience send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 sample in one of the 16 WHO reference labs for confirmed analysis.
Of the 16 reference labs, 7 are in Asya, 5 are in Euopa, 2 are in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the range -Postive as % of the analyses - is influenced by the policy of the country's analysis.
The country that only checks people admitted to hospitals will have a higher positive rate when %s of tests than the country assesses all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other things to be fair.
Handwashing (or handwashing), also known as rules of keeping hand hygiene (hand hygiene), is an action in cleaning hands of own hands for desire of land removal, grease, microorganisms, or other non-friendly ingredients.
← Continued washing of hands with soap in the definite ← dangerous situations » in the sun inhibits the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, passed through the route from mouth to mouth by the fecal tract )
Respiratory people such as flu or common colds, for example, will be infected if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (these are mucous membranes).
The five critical moments in the days that it is important to cover hands include: before and after the increase, after the child's mutton or changing diapers, prior to child feeding, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Without water and soap, hands can be cleaned with ash.The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, while, and after preparing a meal.
Before and after protecting a sick person.
Then replace with a diaper or clean the bathroom boy.
After you rise, cough or chirp.
After handling the animal, animal food, or animal dung.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the habits of health care related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or medical care may stop or reduce the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteriories, microbes, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or diseases.
This is especially important to people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing flu spread, coronaviruses, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and lower the number of infant mortality in births in the home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing can bring a slight improvement in children under five years of age.
In developed countries, rates of death rates associated with breathing and diarrheic diseases can be reduced by the onset of simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that progress hand washing can reduce a third of the events of diarrhea, and this can be compared to giving clean water in low wages areas.
48% reduction of tattooing episodes can be linked to hand washing. Hand washing is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (RI), as automatic behavior done in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pulmonya, a major ARI, is the first cause of death in children under five years of age, which robs the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
The diarrhea and pneumonia are at the same time due to about 3.5 million deaths of children each year.
According to UNICEF, when hands are habited before eating and after a bath it can save more lives than a vaccine or medical intervention, reducing death from diarrhea by about half and death from acute respiratory infections a quarter or one quarter.
Hand washing is often accompanied by other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene or water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against the grip transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is regular hand washing can lead to skin damage due to skin drying.
The 2012 Danish study found that too much hand washing can cause a sense of numbness, sculpting skin which is also known as an exema in hand or hand dermatis, which is more common in health care workers.
Extreme hand washing has also been seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five decisions during the day where washing hands with soap is important for reducing the transmission of fecal-oral disease; after the use of the bathroom (wifting, fouling), after cleaning the child's mutton (for changing diapers), before the child's feeding, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
On another occasion when the rightness of hand washing should be trained for restraining the transmission of the disease to cover the new and after the treatment of cut or wound; after breaking, coughing, or washing your nose; after touching animal dung or touching animals; and after touching the waste.
In many countries, there are low rates of washing hands with soap.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that in the average, 38.7% of households customized hand washing with soap.A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was near the center with 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate of 23 percent. Some habits were now there for increasing intelligence in soapy hand washing habits at critical times. The group washing hands for young schools was one or the developed countries for washing down to the hands of youth.

Swimming twice a year, filled with washing hands daily with soap, tooth brushing with fluorie, is in its middle national program.
This is also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin was added to the addition of detergents or water detergents.
The main action of detergents and detergents is to reduce solution barriers, and increase melting capacity.
Skin cleansing is not effective simply because fats and proteins do not easily mix with water, where they are parts of organic soil.
Cleaning, however, is aided by the calibrated flow of water.
Solid bacterial soap obtained from previous uses can be combined, due to its re-use properties.
A small number of studies that looked at the conversion of germs from contaminated whole soap have decided that the translation was uncertain because the bacteria had already been washed off by the bubble.

Antibacterial soaps have become highly advanced in the public to be blamed for health.
Today, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants is chosen for organisms that are resistant to antibiotics in its nature.
Antibacterial detergents, however, contain common antibacterial agents such as the trilosan, with a broad list of non-investigated species of organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic resistance strains were not chosen for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are being traded.
In addition to surfactant and skin protection agents, sophisticated formulas (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) may contain acids as pH regulators, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and additional skin conditioning (aloe vera, vitamin, pinghol, plant juices). A comprehensive examination from the Public Health School (School of Public Health) of Oregon Levels that simple soaps are effective with consumerative anti-graderitial drugs that contain obstructive sores and antis removed from the hands.
Hot water that is comfortable washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria increase rapidly in body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water in the removal of natural oils that will remain of soils and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that the use of homogeneous water has no effect on the reduction of germs in the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic of the hand is a cleaning organ of the g hand that is not used with water.
In the latter part of the 1990s and early 21st century, agents began to gain prominence in hand-cleaning alcohol-washing hands that were not-sa-sa-watered (also known as based-sa-alkohol hand washes, antiseptic handwashings, or hand sanitizers).
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol outlined mixture of thickening agent such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) which produces gel, or a humectant such as glycerin to convert into a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol drying.
The addition of diluted hydrogen-peroxide adds more antimicrobial activity.The hand sanitizers that contain the lowest 60% to 95% alcohol are effective germicides.
Sanitizer brushes with alcohol kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (such as HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol that will kill 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, partner in reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in hands 30 seconds after placement and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria in hands 1 minute after deployment. The hand sanitizers are completely effective against bacteria and not how effective in some microbes.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost all ineffective against the norrovirus (or Norwalk) species of microbes, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis.The average amount of hand antiseptic or penetrating alcohol must be used to completely read or conquer both hands.
The front and back of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers are closed about 30 seconds until liquid, bubble, or gel dry.
The tip of the fingers should also be washed well, serve them on both palms.The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing more than hand sanitizer control, especially when the hands are visible to be dirty.
The rising use of these agents is based on their frequency of use and rapid execution activity against micro-organisms; however, they should not serve as a replacement for proper hand washing unless there is no soap and water.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause skin drying unless softeners and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The boiling effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other softening to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softeners caused the whole of less irritation of skin and drying than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatis, contact urticaria syndrome or excessive alcohol sensitivity or additives present in alcoholic hands rubs rarely occur.
A lower tendency to accelerate irritant contact dermatitis has become attributable to hand washing using soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not clean organic material in the hands, but they are only infected.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many causes of disease, because the causes of disease remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of the non-alcoholic hand sanitizer relies heavily on ingredients and formulas, and historically it is important to be less effective than alcohol and alcohol poisonings.
More recently, formulas using benzalconium chloride have been shown to have repeated and collected antimicrobial activity after anointing, not alcohol-like, which showed a decrease in efficacy after repeated use, perhaps due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ash or land.
Dust or soil can be more effective than water alone, but it can be less effective than soap.
One concern is whether microorganisms have infected soil or ash it can increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
As with soap, ash is a disinfectant agent due to water binding, it becomes an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The rightness of hand washing has been recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for the prevention of disease transmission that embraces the following steps:
Read the hands of hot or cold flowing water.
Flowing water is recommended because water can be contaminated, while water temperature seems to have no difference.
Fix the soap in the hands with the rings with a full amount of soap, along with the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap lifts germs from the skin, and studies have shown that people behave in washing their hands vigorously when using soap rather than just water.
Press at least 20 seconds.
Whistleblowing creates friction, which contributes to the removal of microbes from the skin, and long-term scratching removes more microbes.
Wash well under running water.
Swimming the flute can re-contamination hands.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and sweating hands are easier to recontaminate.The most commonly overlooked area is thumb, pulse, places between fingers, and under nails.
Artificial claws and nail pigments with a hard object can hide microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended for prevention of hand poisoning; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
← Other cheap options can be made to facilitate hand washing where tap water and/or soap cannot be used . Pouring water from applied jerrycan or gourd with appropriate pores and/or use of ash if needed in developing countries.In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or accommodations in developing countries), there are water saving solutions, such as--tippy-pap » and other cheap options--
Tippy-tap is a simple technology using a bottle stuck in the rope, and a legged lever to pour a little water into the hands and a soap bar.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there are some debates in the most effective form of drying public washings.
A growing whole of the research suggests that towel roles are cleaner than the powered hand towers seen in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of cleanliness offered by paper towels, hand dryers with warm air, and more modern jet-air hands dryers.
After washing and drying hands using the dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria was identified added to the average over the fingers by 194% and to the palms by 254%.
Driving with jet-air dryer caused an average to increase the total number of bacteria on the top of the fingers by 42% and in the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands using paper towels, the total number of bacteria was reduced in average on finger surfaces by up to 76% and in palms by up to 77%.Scientists also conducted tests to determine if there had been potential contamination by other users of the washing and washing environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet-air dryer, where air is emitted out of the unit with a peak speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganism from the hands and the unit and it is possible to infect another person using the bathroom and the bathroom environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a wire-air hand dryer will spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no meaningful spread of microorganisms.In 2005, in a study done by TUV Product und Umwelt, other hand drying techniques were cared for.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after drying hands have been observed:
Many different hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers are compared against drying paper towels.
It is an alternative as we travel without soap and water to wash our hands using handwashes.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer needs to be available to not less than 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after a Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital environment.
Some electronic devices provide feedback to remind the hospital staff of washing their hands if they have forgotten.
A study learned the decreased number of infections in their use.
Medical hand washing is for the minimum of 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or gel to boil and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed into all parts.
If there is dirt under the nail, brush teeth can be used to remove them.
Because microbes can stay in the water in the hands, it is important to take a good look and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to kill water (and to open any show door if necessary).
This avoids unclean hands again from his joints.
The reason for hand washing in the state of health care is for the removal of pathogenic microorganisms - microbials-and avoid their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that lack of hand washing remained in unacceptable levels in almost every medical area, with large numbers of doctors and nurses often forgetting washing their hands before touching patients, thus spreading microorganisms.
A study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could lower the number of blood vessels infections associated with catheter by 66 percent.The World Health Organization published a paper showing common hand washing and hand rubing in health care sectors.
The plan to guide the health care guidelines of the organization's hand can also be seen on his website for public commentary.
A related review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial tools can measure and confirm the hand health care rule, if showing the enforcement of regulation is necessary.
← The World Health Organization has » Five Senses » for washing hands:
after exposure to blood fluids/body
before an aseptic function, and
after patient care . The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap-medicated α or αantimicrobial - detergents) is delivered by the killer action in a hand-washing agent.
Such action of killing may be desired before performing surgery or in areas where antibiotic resistance organisms are prevalent.To scan a person's hands for a medical operation, there must be a tap that can be opened and broken without hand-held, there is chlorohexidine or iodine washing, sterilized scales for brushing and another sterilized instrument for cleaning under hand nails.
All jewelry should be removed.
This technique required washing hands and arms up to elbow, usually 25–6 minutes.
Long hours of rubbing (10 minutes) are not required.
When breathing, the water in the arms needs to be held back from flowing back into the hands.
After hand washing has been completed, the hands are dry with clean cloth and wear the medical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use an antiseptic for the hand before or after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was learned that the greatest benefit from handwashing came from the first 20% of washing, and very little additional benefits were obtained at a rate of 35% hand cleaning.
Washing using conventional soap causes more than triple levels of infected bacteria which are transmitted to food compared to washing hands with anti-battery soap. Comparing hand rubing with alcohol-washing solution with counter-battered soap for median time 30 seconds has shown everyone that rubbing the alcohol hand reduces bacterial contamination by 26% more than anti-battered soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand-feedings for reduction of H1N1 influenza A microbial and Clostridium difficle spores from the hands.The means of improving hand health care guidelines in the health care environment may require education for the hand washing staff, ensure that alcohol-based hand rub can be used, and remind the staff that is written and word.
There is a need for more research on which of the methods is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing is recognized as a economical, important tool for obtaining good health, and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, in schools and in the workplace makes it a challenge to achieve the general practice of hand washing.
For example, most African farms are hand washing taps close to each private or public toilet is not enough, even if there are cheap options to make hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing levels can also be the result of habitual behavior than is caused by lack of soap and water.
Promotion and adpolation of hand washing using soap can influence parking fares, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term change in population behavior.
For it to work effectively, rule and exchange are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, as social marketing campaigns were less effective. An example for promoting hand washing in schools is the \"Three Star Approach\" of UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure students to wash their hands with soap, among other health needs.
Once the minimum standard is reached, schools can move from one to the highest of three stars.
Building hand washing stations can be part of handwashing campaigns conducted to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Handwashing Day is an example of raising this conscious campaign is trying to detect a change of behavior.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pancreas, UNICEF began adopting a handwashing emojia.
Few studies have thought of the total effectiveness of hand washing costs in developing countries in conjunction with DALYs that have been avoided.
However, one stew suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is more important than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health - specifically for people with poor conditions such as mothers who were just born or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first nakilla in the mid-19th century by two mayors of hand health care: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the English - characterized by modern care-
At that time most people still believed that infections were caused by bad odors called miarmas.
In 1980, outbreaks of dietary and health care disorders combined with infections gave way to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in more actively promoting hand health care as an important way of preventing the spread of infection.
The spread of thewine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness of the importance of washing hands with soap in many countries to protect oneself from those infectious diseases.
For example, signs with - methods of proper handwashing - were hung next to the sink for hand washing in public toilets and in toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The term - washing of the own hand of something, meaning expressing that the commitment of responsibility for something or sharing the struggle with it is heavy in the heart.
It is derived from a copy of the biblical in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the cross by the cross Hesu Christ, but became a phrase with a wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins forcing her hands to wash in an attempt to clean up the imagined stain, representing her with a guilty conscience regarding the crimes she has committed and encouraged her husband to do.
It has also been known that people, after learning or thinking about non-ethical practices, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to appreciate washing equipment more frequently.
And then, those people who are allowed to wash their hands after the like of the above reflection aren't too likely to participate in other-cleaning - equal actions, such as volunteer work.
The churches advise hand washing for the same hygiene and symbolic purposes.The symbolic washing of hands, using water but no soap in handwashing, is part of the ritual of hand washing that has been featured in many religions, including the Belief Bahá'í, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Labo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. The churches also advise hand washing for cleanliness, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam command hand washing after use of the bathroom.
And, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands before or after each meal.
Control of risk in the workplace for COVID-19
Risk controls in the workplace for COVID-19 is the application of work safety and health procedures for risk controls in avoiding coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk control in the workplace depends on the worksite and job duty, based on an analysis of the risk of infection outcomes, community disease availability, and risk factors of individual workers who may be weak to become infected with COVID-19.
According to the U.S. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the U.S., jobs with low risk exposure have few contacts with public and other colleagues, where basc control of infection is recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory standards, and maintaining a cleanup routine and avoiding the work environment.
People with less risky jobs include frequent or close contact with people unknown or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected by the practice of community transmission or world travel.
These include workers who have contact with the general public such as schools, working environments with high population density, and some of the areas of high volume fractures.
Risk control for this group includes, in addition to the methods of basic infection control ventilation using high-intensity air filters, obstructions against breaking, and having personal protective equipment that can be used in case a person with COVID-19 can mix.
OSHA considers health care and burial workers exposed to a known or suspected person with COVID-19 at risk of high exposure, which increases the very high risk exposure if workers engage in aerosol production techniques, or collect or retrieve specimens from a known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Risk controls appropriate to these workers include engineering controls such as ventilation in the room with negative pressure, and personal protective equipment appropriate for job duty.
The prevalence of COVID-19 can have some of the effects within the workplace.
Workers may miss work because of illness, which needs to take care of others, or the fear that it is possible to become infected.
Business patterns can change, both when it comes to what is asked for goods, and the way these goods are obtained (such as shopping for hours to earn or through delivery or by drive-through service or vehicle access to purchase).
Finally, sending items from geographic areas that were seriously affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted.A readiness to infectious disease and respondive plan can be used to guide protective actions.
Plans respond to the risk levels associated with different worksites and job duties, including the sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community area, and risk factors of individual workers such as aging or chronic medical intervention.
It also outlines the controls necessary to meet those risks, and plans regardless of the circumstances that may arise as a result of the spread of the disease.
Willingness to infectious disease and response plans may be subject to national and subnational recommendations.
The purposes of response to the prevalence of disease include reducing the infection of personnel, protecting people at high risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operation, and reducing side effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The availability of the community disease in which the business was located affected the respondents conducted.
The hierarchy of risk controls is the framework that is widely used for job safety and health to group risk controls according to effectiveness.
Where the risks to COVID-19 may not be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative control, and later in protective equipment.
Engineering controls that involve isolating employees from the risks associated with work without relying on the behavior of the worker, and can be the most economical solution to implement.
Administrative controls are modified in employment policy or procedures that require labour or employee action.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but can help prevent some of the exposures.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk to the worker, which is well adapted if possible (e.g., respirators), which are continually and appropriately worn, which are frequently checked, maintained, and replaced, if necessary, and appropriately removed, cleaned, and stored or discarded to prevent contamination.
Accounting to the U.S. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the U.S., jobs with low risk of infection have few public employment contacts and other colleagues.
The basilic methods of prevention of infection were recommended for all workplaces frequent and thorough handwashing, urging workers to stay at home if they were ill, respiratory skills including oral control when coughing and breaking, providing a container of tissues and garbage, preparing for telecommuting or shift timed intervals if necessary, preventing workers from using other tools' stakes toes and equipment, and keeping frequent cleaning and distilling around work.
Quick identification and separation of the potentials to infect individual is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of chronic respiratory disease remain at home until their fever, fever signals, and any other symptoms of about 24 hours without using a reduction of fever or other symptom reliever drugs, and sickle leave policies can be changed, allow employees to stay at home to care for the sick family member, and employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs with less serious risk exposure include those who need frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SIRS-COV-2 due to the community's being carried out transmission throughout the business location, or because the nonbidwal has a recent world travel to the site with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers with general public contact such as schools, work environment with many populations, and some of the areas of fractures with high volume. Engineering control for this and groups of higher risk installing air filter with high effectiveness, increasing ventilation levels, installing physical decay like clear plastic charge for breaking, and some of the areas of the fracture with high volume. included Engineering control for it and groups of high risk installing air filtering, increasing levels of ventilation, installment of clear plastic charge, and storage of personal waste disposal, face-throughs Use of the drive-through-through-through-through-the-out equipment, multiple-force intervention intervention intervention interventions, intervention intervention interventions and intervention intervention intervention interventions, intervention intervention interventions, multiple workers and interventions, intervention interventions, interventions, and intervention intervention intervention intervention intervention interventions, and interventions to work-offs, intervention, and intervention intervention, and intervention of government-offs, intervention.
Workers in this endangered group will rarely need the use of respirators.
If a person gets sick in an airplane, along with the proper control to protect workers and other passengers is to separate the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assign a crew member to serve the sick person, and offer face masks to the sick person or ask the sick person to cover their mouth and nose of the tissues when coughing or moving.
The cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick traveler or handling body fluids or potential contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sufferer travels with fever, repetitive coughing, or difficulty breathing.
The gloves and other waste items should be disposed of in the biohazard bag, and the contaminated surface should be cleaned and infected afterward.For commercial shipping, among other sailing ships and other passenger vehicles, risk controls include delays in travel if there is a disease, and isolation and promptly informing the medical center of the ship when one has a fever or other symptoms during the ship's load.
It is better that medical follow-ups should occur in the isolated human room.For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and infecting if the infected person comes from the school building regardless of the community's scope.
When there is a small to moderate community transmission, discharts can be implemented in social distancing such as canceling field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or food in a cafeteria, raising space between tables, not arriving and leaving simultaneously, limiting unimportant visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with symptoms like flu.
If there is a large transmission to the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school closure can be considered. For staff implementing law enforcement in daily routine activity, employer health risk is considered low according to CDC.
Official law enforcements that should interact with individuals that confirm or suspect with COVID-19 are advised to follow the same rules as in emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protection equipment.
When closed contact occurs or close contact at hospital time, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belt and gear before re-use using spray or household cleaning, and follow common operating procedures for locking and washing clothes.
OSHA considers some particular health care workers and targets located in a high or very high category of exposure risk.
Jobs with high risk of infection include delivery of health care, support, labs, and medical transport workers exposed to unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This becomes a very high risk of exposure when workers perform methods using aerosol, or collecting or managing specimens from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol production techniques include intubation, bow speed techniques, bronchoscopy, some of the dental operations and tests, or collecting infectious specimens.
High exposure to the risk of burial work includes workers involved in the care of human bodies informed or suspected case of CoVID-19 at their death time; these become high risk when they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolated rooms for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, amongst the practice of aerosol production techniques.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be suited to some health care and funeral arrangements.
Specimens should be managed by Level 3 keeping Biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that future patients be separated from designated waiting sites depending on whether they are the case of suspected COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, the OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet known to have, or suspected of infection by SARS-CoV2, and people who engage in aerosol spraying techniques.
In the United States, N95 face-to-face filter respirators approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of comprehensive, written respiratory protection program including community analysis, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirator can provide higher protection and improve worker convenience. WHO does not recommend coveralls because COVID-19 is a disease that is inhales than is transmitted through body fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for entry filtering personnel.
For those collecting breathing specimens from, tending for, or transferring COVID-19 patients with no formation-of-the-erosol techniques, WHO recommends chirrical masks, goggles, or face-up, toga, and gloves.
When a build-of-aerosol technique is performed, an N95 or FFP2 respirator will replace the curricular mask.
Because the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE by telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, only allow those of direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for certain activity, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it as it is cared for many patients with the same dynosis, monitoring and coordination of PPE's supply, and suppressing the use of masks for non-impatic asymptatic functions.

LICENSING: CC0: No rights reserved
We see ourselves in the noticeable state of this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that eliminates our worldwide connectivity with man and the responsibilities that we have with each other.
We did not go ahead with its challenges, but we knew that our best response depended on the kind of worldwide compassion, cooperation, and community building that was in the midst of this club.
The hero and care we see among all our peers via email, calls, and chat is a notable proof of the wonderful people we have been blessed to be with.
I will not be more grateful and proud to consider all of you as colleagues.
During the last week, a person shared my appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia today, and what powerful symbol it is to keep this valuable resource online and be used by everyone.
This makes your work possible, whether it is to keep neighborhoods alive or to pay our peers or make our communities safe.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia now more than ever.
This is the moment when we do not just do what we do, but how we do it will have a meaningful effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your duty here, we will make some meaningful edits on how we will cooperate, starting with the coming week.
Fitting to our work and schedules
Similar to what Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the days and months to come.
In that conversation, we have considered what we think is an appropriate response to what we are facing and the best way to continue maintaining the organization at this time.
We desperately wanted to get rid of the stress and support our long - term mission.
If you need to call again, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors, and labor contracts:
It would be 4 hours a day our daily expectations of working, or 20 hours a week to additional attention.
We do not declare crime - so that you work more normal hours, the mission can use you.
However, the world is far from perfect today, and if you need to care for your loved ones, buy grocery stores, or go to a doctor, we put your interests first.
We don't monitor your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should leave without saying anything, but we say it.
It does not take days of delay because of illness or PTO - just tell your overseer and help your team to change calendars and schedules to make sure that the major workplaces are occupied.
>>zsm_Latn<< (If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan wihin T&amp;C Ops know so T&amp;C can help with support and make sure your situation gets approprate attension from management).
Employees who work each hour will be paid in full.
We have already said, and again promises to honor our commitments to our contractors and colleagues who are paid each hour’s work.
Each will be paid in their usual hours of work at the time of the usual situation.
This includes whether you are ill or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll report you.
People use work as a means to remove their stress from the world around us.
What we do is very enjoyable, especially at times like this.
Again, it's about your self-care.
We'll talk to your overseer, so that we know what to expect and we can advance accordingly.
Some of the jobs are considered important.
There were a few things we had to keep going.
>>zsm_Latn<< The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety, and Fundraising teams (at the others) do critique work that has a need Additional support.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess current objectives and move our attention to helping what is important for our mission.
There is much that can be done for all of us, we should all focus on the most important project.
Now slowing down will not hurt the host.
We don't plan to--double the time to catch up - at the time when the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are not now realistic.
We accept that conditions have changed, and will work to set new targets and timelines if appropriate.
What happened to the APP (Annual Planning or Annual Planning)?
To fit our new reality and daily expectations at work time, we wanted to fit the timeline for the delivery of our Annual Plan of 2020-2021.
We intend to plan an extension in our 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgeting to allow employees to prioritize important jobs, self-care, and care for loved ones while caring for people who need or want to work to reduce the schedule in the next few weeks.
The lengthening of this timeline greatly reduces the current planning of the amount of work and pressure throughout the organization.
We will introduce our proposal to the Team the following week and update to the delegates and team in the next steps at the time that we will have a confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership here.
Office status, exposure, and cleanup
In one week, we learned that one of our colleagues from SF was possibly exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In addition to many warnings, however, we took a job to clean up the contamination to infect all the tops in the San Francisco office.
They use a solution against spreading appropriate to the hospital level to infect each surface, as well as the corridor and elevator landings that reach our floor.
Developing its own duty-of-preservation protocol using products that support the safety of their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be ready when we go back.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has already shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC based characters.
Starting last week, our DC office was changed to the full remote setup according to the direction shared in San Francisco.
Since some of our NYC-based colleagues already knew, we also discussed the change of location in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but can be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked long distances for the first time.
Our colleagues know that it can be an appropriate one, and want to offer you some of the advice:
Limit the length of the meetings to an hour or two to the highest.
If a longer session is required, consider how to separate them throughout the course of a few days.
It is clear that the meetings are well - illustrated, have a agenda, and send out literature ahead of time.
Make video common, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to perform live collaboration and connection.
Prior to the management of each meeting, a person who will monitor the chat for the questions and monitor the speaker list, and a person who will help to record (or do the help-list).
Send an email to the tech supplier if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your goodness reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
HR Operations consult the direction of ergonomics based on webinar to support the rise of distributed work throughout the Foundation.
This past mistake we have asked all community recipients to cancel public-ordered events-of-Wikimedia, like edits, until WHO has declared the pandemic over.
We let them know that we understood that our request for canceling and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their activities agreed upon and that no one would be punished for having delay or change those objectives.
In the coming week we will follow-up for additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conference.
The general sentiment throughout the world community seems to be unhappy with the destruction but ease of clarification and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and others.
Continuing, CRT works to create a Meta-Wiki page to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Maintaining contact around related issues at COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for special meeting of the characters.
We will use this time to share updates, answer your questions and take a few hours to check with each other.
We are here together and here to help whatever we can to cope.
In the meantime, you can continue looking for information from this email, and all other important information related to COVID-19, at the Wiki Office.
CRT will keep these pages updated and put all the information in one place.
We also work to maintain regular communications with personnel living in countries that are currently widely affected.
If you have questions about travel, event, or large workflows, challenge coverage, or whatever you may need help, do not hesitate to consult and collaborate with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and connect as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive problem, please email Bryan Judahn - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an extension of our work and obligations.
Instead, they recognize that at this moment, our activities and obligations are likely to fit in the way we are not in the past.
Here are the steps that we believe are necessary to support this one another so that we can continue to work, provide our action with the help they need, and the world with the service they expect.
Our planned work was waiting for us when the time came.
Today, it's time to collaborate with each other and create space for important work to come in the following weeks and potential months before.
We need all of you to do so, and therefore we need all of you to take care of yourself and your families so that you will be in the best condition when there is a need.
So now please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Angiotensin-converting ensimo 2 (ACE2) is an ensimo attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
The ACE2 counters the activity of the associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing volume The(1-7) making it a reliable target drug for treating cardiovascular diseases.ACE2 also serves as the entrance of cells for some coronivores.
Often referred to as hACE2 is the masculine version of the enzyme.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc containing a metalloenzyme found on the endothelial surface and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal Collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type membrane protein, along with the enzymatic active domain exposed to the surface of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is absorbed from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and at the end will be released into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 binds to the cell membrane of the main lung type II alveolar cells, esterocytes of the small intestine, arteryal and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main role of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance in ACE.
ACE separates angiotensin I hormone from vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 breaks down carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-He-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyse it in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-H-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break some other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the trajectory of the membrane of neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and associated Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main point of access to cells for certain coronivores, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, it results in endocytosis and translocation of the same microbes and the enzyme in endososomes found within cells the formation of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells.
The process of this entry also requires preparation of the S protein through host serine protease TMPRSS2, suppressing where it is under current investigation as potential therapeutic.It has led some to think that reducing ACE2 levels, in cells, may help fight infection.
Nevertheless, many professional societies and bodies of regulation endorse the continuation of standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
— A systematic analysis and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a meaningful 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the controls α

Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new drug for lung damage, and seems to have improved pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen ionization in biles with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory stress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of movement is 30 minutes in addition to the course of effect (long) 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 can be a reliable drug for those with intolerance in classical rein-angiotensant system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where flowing angiotensin II is high.Infused rhACE2 has been diagnosed with clinical tests for treatment of acute respiratory stress syndrome.

Many applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Some frameworks have been developed for the formation of the contact breaker apps.
Privacy worries have risen, especially about systems that have developed in monitoring the geographical location of app users.
Less distracting alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to map a user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced jointly that they would combine the operation to support the Bluetooth-based content apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in cooperation with the Happy, has formed an app that allows citizens to determine whether they encounter people with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities of China. In Singapore, using an app called TraceTogether.

Both Australia and New Zealand consider apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 resident in Moscow, designed to ensure that they will not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of potential functional problems in app-based systems, along with negatives and the potential lack of effectiveness if app resources are limited to a small portion of the population.

The campaigners expressed in privacy their concern about the implications of monitoring the mass using coronvirus apps, particularly about whether the created monitoring data to deal with the coronvirus epidemic would disappear when the threat passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement that called for limitations on this type of monitoring.
Organizations announced eight conditions in government projects:
← Must ← According to the law, important and proportional - the observation;
there must be a definite date of completion extensions of monitoring and monitoring;
data usage must be limited to COVID-19 purposes;

any distribution of data to the third parties must be referred to in law;
there should be protections against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuses;

Google/Apple's proposed plan plans plan plan to meet the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the monitoring mechanism from their device's operating systems as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries use site evacuations that have access to the network rather than apps, eliminating the same need to download apps and the ability to prevent escape.
In Israel, network-based detection is approved.
Network-based solutions with access to raw location data have important potential privacy problems.
Nevertheless, not all systems with central servers need to have access to data of personal location; some privacy maintenance systems are created using only central servers for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-born-sa-app system was used to carry out contact monitoring.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected escape data from various sources including data flow from mobile device and data from the transaction card, and combined them to form notifications through text messages to potentially infected indibidwals.
More than using this information to alert possible contacts, the public has also made access to location information, something that is allowed for major changes in data privacy laws after MERS outbreak has developed in that country.
This information can be used publicly by some apps and websites.The countries including Germany consider the use of the same centralized and maintain-private systems.
Until April 6, 2020, details had not been released.
Contact tracking privacy is a well established concept, with a large body of research literature dating back in 2013.On the 7th of April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups work on solutions that identify privacy, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to map a user's approach to other mobile phones.
Nevertheless, PEP-PT is a co-ordination effort that contains the same centralized and decentralized procedures, and not a single protocol.Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Tracking Maintaining Privacy (DP-PPT / DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number Numbers (TCN, fka Number Connection to Performance, CEN), Protox Sensitivity in Privacy and Mechanisms for Mobility Tracking (CT and others).
In these protocols, data that refers to personal identity will never be removed from the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group in the MIT Media Lab forms SafePaths, a platform for using privacy maintenance techniques when collecting and using data at the pathway or location to follow the spread of COVID-19.
← It is based on research from the whitepaper »Apps Gone Rogue: It is based on research from whitepaper ←Apps Gone Rogue:Infinitive Personal Privacy in an Epidemic » released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafetyTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that forms privacy technologies that was originally established in MIT Media Lab-
SafeTrace uses secure technology hardware to allow users to share sensitive data and location with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the international TCN Coalition was established by teams that joined for almost the same methods and foot-to-foot protocols for the most part, with the purpose of reducing the disparity, and raising the worldwide interoperability of the apps of verbal and alert, a major aspect to the attainment of widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it opened the BlueTrace protocol used by its government's official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the mobile platforms of Android and iOS, announced initiative for contact monitoring, which they claimed to maintain privacy, based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography in maintaining-private.
They also published references to key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be rolled into three phases:
Trolling of toolbars to raise governments to create official maintenance of coronavirus tracing apps
the incorporation of this operation directly into iOS and AndroidGoogle and Apple is plan to meet access and continuous surveillance problems with the initial system distribution through operating system updates, and eventually displace them in the same way as the threat has passed away.
Reposition of medication (also known as drug use in other ways, re-prophiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the use of an alphabetical medicine for treating other disease or medical condition than the original cause of its formation.
It is a line of scientific research that is currently being continued to develop a safe and effective treatment of COVID-19.
Other research directions include the formation of a COVID-19 vaccine and translation of convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has an estimated 66 treated proteins, each with multiple binding parts of the ligand.
Giving a reasonable project to the development of effective antiviral medication against COVID-19 proteins the removal of the binding sites.
Of the most important SARS-CoV-2 the target proteins are food-like proteases, RNA independent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.

The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothesical vaccine against coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Even though no vaccine has completed clinical tests, there are many attempts to launch the formation of the natural vaccine.
In the latter part of February 2020, the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, WHO) stated that it does not expect a vaccine against SARS-COV-2, to be used for less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Level I survival study in April.
COVID-19 was referred to in December 2019.
The spread of a major worldwide burst in 2020, leading to large investment and research activity to form a vaccine.
Many organizations use distributed genomes to form possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
It was said in April that the requirements for the CEPI initiative for vaccine development were speed, manufacturing capacity, mass shipping, and international access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development in the first part of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Basic platform targets that have advanced in Phase I safety studies include:

As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 signed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others were declared, but there was little public information available (preferred to planning or design).
An Level I-II test that performs an early survival test and immunologicity, is usually randomized, controlled by placebo, and in many places, while referring to more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a control group, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects on the best dose.

In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities expelled resources to access the IBM supercomputers, along with cloud computing sources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called side effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the illness they are fighting.
An additional unselected Australian test seeks to list 4,170 health care workers.
It is possible that vaccines made will not be safe or effective.
Early research to analyze the effectiveness of vaccine using animal models particular to COVID 19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicates the need for biosafety-level 3 control measures for life-holding viruses, and international coordination to determine in standard safety procedures.
Non-human animal models have tested vaccines against SARS and MERS.
As far as 2020, no drug or preventive vaccine for SARS has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against infection in MERS-CoV.
Until March 2020, there was a (with DNA) MERS vaccine completed Phase I in clinical trials in humans, and three others performed, all viral-vectored vaccines, two adenovial-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and an MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posters have promoted a conspiracy theory that claims that the virus behind COVID-19 is already known and that there is already a vaccine available.
The patents mentioned by various social media signs have consulted existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronvirus strains such as SARS coronvirus.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease is a infectious disease caused by serious acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing stress.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat swelling, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is often for five days but it can last from two to fourteen days.
As most cases cause mild symptoms, some progress into pneumonia virus and loss of many organs.
Until the 17th of April 2020, over 2.24 million cases were reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is primarily spreading between people with close contact, often by small droplets caused by coughing, breaking, or speaking.
As these tiny droplets form when exhaling breath, they usually fall to the ground or to the surfaces rather than become infected at distant distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminating order and following the touch of their eyes, nose or mouth.
The germs can survive in nutrients up to 72 hours.
This is completely contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread is possible before the symptoms and the later stages of the disease.The standard diagnosis method is in the role of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people who suspect that they have had microbes and their guardians.
Various recommendations for the use of masking in the general public, where several authorities recommend against its use, some recommend using it, and others order its use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or particular antiviral drug for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost every country in all six WHO regions.
It is infected with germs can be asymptomatic or produces flu-stimulous symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathiness.
Symptoms of emergency include difficulty in breathing, repetitive pain or chest suffocation, confusion, difficulty in rising, and facial disturbances or lips; counsel the employer medical attention if there are these symptoms.
Not usually, symptoms above can be seen such as swelling, diarrheic or inflammation of the throat.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are observed in different percentages.
Few cases in China have at first presented only chest congestion and vibrations.
In some, the disease can grow in pneumonia, multi-organ meure, and death.
It is called the incubation period.
The duration of the incubation for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can cover from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms will continue within 11.5 days of infection.The reports show that not all infections develop symptoms.
Its function of asymmatic carriers in the transmission has not yet been fully known; however, the preliminary evidence suggests that they can be caused by the spread of the disease.
Proportions of infected people who do not exhibit symptoms are currently unknown and studied, which the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remained without symptoms during their hospital stay time.
China's National Health Commission began to include unsigned cases in its daily cases on 1 April; in 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) did not have signs in the time of analysis.
The same dura and saliva can carry many viruses.
Strong speech emits much less drop than usual speech.
A Singapore study saw that coughing without cover can release small drops traveling up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Even if the virus is not airy in general, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol transfer may be possible and air collectors positioned in the corridor outside of the human chambers have obtained samples that are positive to viral RNA.
Some medical remedies such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions that would be zeroing and thus lead to air dispersal.
As there are concerns that it can spread through pollutants, this risk is believed to be low.The microbial is more contagious when people are symptomatic; as the spread can be possible before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, a person in general is infected with two to three others. The virus lives for several hours or days on touched objects.
In particular, the virus is known to be visible one day on the cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISIS 304), and up to four hours at 99% copper.
This, however, varies depending on the range and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective when used correctly; soap products weaken the fat barrier layer of microbes, kill it, and free them from skin and other surface.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine glucone (a surgical disinfectant), reduce efficiency.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken between two days after the onset of hospitalization.
Of five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day diagnosed.
The acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe breathing syndrome of the coronavirus, first separated from three people with pneumonia connected to cases of serious respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 microbes have settled in the related coronviruses that are in nature.
Outside of the human body, the germ is killed by the housing sap, where the bubble that protected it explodes. SARS-CoV-2 is closely connected with the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs that are most affected by COVID-19 because the microbials access the host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-nako-convert of enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The germ uses a special external glycoprotein called αspike α (peplomer) for a common in ACE2 and to insert into the host cell.
Serious heart damage has been discovered in 12% of infected persons admitted to the hospital in Wuhan, China, and this is more frequent in serious illness.
The number of cardiovascular symptoms is high, caused by systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders as the disease progresses, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 heart receptors.
ACE2 receptors are high in the heart and this has to do with heart function.
High incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with poor prognosis or disease recognition. The autopsies of people who died at COVID-19 have been diagnosed with diffuse alveolar gumae (DAD), and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory inhibitors within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for ACE2- declares epithelial cells of respiratory tract, there are systemic hyperinflammation symptoms for patients with severe COVID-19.
Naama, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with the recruitment of inherited IL-6-secreting monocytes and serious lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates are also recorded in autopsia.
WHO published some of the diagnostic protocols for the disease.
The standard analysis method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The analysis is traditionally done in breathing samples that have been captured a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or plema sample can also be used.
The results are generally available for several hours to two days.
Blood tests could be used, but they required two blood samples taken by a two week interval and the results had a small quick price.
Chinese scientists have separated the coronavirus strain and published a genetic result so that laboratories around the world can freely form tests of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viral infection.
It seems that on the 4th of April 2020, antibody tests (where active infections can be seen and even a person is infected with the past) are in progress, but not yet in the majority of users.
Chinese test experience showed that full accuracy was only 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care analysis on the 21st of March 2020 for use at the end of the said month.The guidelines for identifying the good properties of a disease left by the Zhonggun Hospital of Wuhan University have proposed attempts to monitor infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacitys with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
Subpleural dominant, crazy paving (blobular septal inflammation with different alveolar filling), and co-operation can appear in the progression of the disease.
Very little data can be used about microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main known causes of autopsia disease are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung bonding and pulmonary water
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, lardage attypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar gume (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is responsible for acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pulmonya treatment: restructuring exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, frequently washing hands with soap and water at least 20 seconds, performing good hygiene and avoiding handling eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose using a tissue when coughing or descending and it is recommended to use the elbow courtyard if there is no tissue to be used.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after any coughing or breaking.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public, participation in limiting the transmission of asymptomatic indibidwals. The aim of social distancing strategies is to reduce the attachment of infected people to large groups on the basis of closed schools and working areas, restricting travel and canceling large public gatherings.
Sanitary guidelines also include that people will have a fixed not less than 6 feet (1.8m) apart.
← There is no known drug effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Because the vaccine cannot be relied on until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of COVID-19 management is the test of reducing epidemic smoking, which is known as the α3–flattening the cruve ααα ααααα αααααααααααααα (αααααα)
The CDC also recommends that midwife wash hands often with soap and water at least 20 seconds, especially after drying or when hands are seen dirty, before eating and after rising, coughing or breathing.
This further recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with no less than 60% alcohol, but only when there is no soap and water available.For places where there are no hand sanitizers, WHO is given two outlines for local production.
In these formulas, anti-microbial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
← Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores from alcohol; it is - not an active substance for hand antisepsis »
Glycerol is added as a maintenance of reading or humectant.
People are supervised with supporting care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of having a virus should wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporaneal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is already used in response to the question of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being considered.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet were recommended for improving immunity.
Supportive treatments may help people with mild symptoms during the early stage of infection. WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonaryists in the U.S. have recorded a free source of treatment recommendations from various agencies, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there was no definite treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetylaminophen) than ibuprofen for the first row of use.
Cares must be taken to reduce the risk of viral spread, especially in the health care area when performing techniques that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals who care for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Airborne Inflation Room (AIIR) as an addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and aerial noise precautions. The CDC outlines guidelines for using personal protective equipment (PPE) while there is a pancreas.
The recommended gear is: Recommended wear is: PPE gown, respirator or facemask, eye protection, and medical gloves.If available, respirators (or facemasks) are preferred.
N95 respirators were approved for industrial sites but the FDA allowed those masks to be used under Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect from particles of air like dust but effectiveness against a particular biological agent is not guaranteed for labelless uses.
When no masks are available, the CDC recommends the use of face masks, or as a final method, home-made masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not very serious to require mechanical ventilation or hypertension, but percentage of cases are.
The type of breathing support for indibidwals associated with COVID-19 the crash of the breathing is currently actively studied for hospital people, with some evidence that intubation can be prevented from the intervention of high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
Neither of these two who go to the same benefit for people who are chronic diseases are unknown.
Some doctors prefer to stay invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of small aerosol particles compared to the high flow of the cannula in the nose.The serious cases are most common in the older adult adult (you are more than 60 years old, and especially the older ones in 80 years).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, either limiting the capacity of a health system to hold a sudden dive in the number of COVID-19 cases that are more serious for hospitalization.
A China study of 5% found entry into intensive care units, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the people in the hospital with COVID-19 were later admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex because acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) is formed in COVID-19 and giving oxygen becomes difficult.
Ventilators with the ability of pressure control modes and high PEEP are required for excessive oxygen transport to increase while reducing the risk of lung damage by the ventilator and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available to old ventilators.
General in January 2020 research on potential treatments, and some antiviral drugs were in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears to be the most expected.
Even new drugs can be taken up to 2021 to form, some of the drugs that have been examined have already been approved for other use or in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicine can be tried by people with serious illness.
WHO recommends volunteers to participate in tests of effectiveness and survival of potential treatments.The FDA has given temporary authorization to convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is serious or employer at risk.
It did not undergo clinical studies to show that it was safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to discuss the outbreak of the disease.
Users were asked to insert their ID name and number.
The app is capable of excrete the αclose contact - using observation data and is therefore a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also investigate the state of other three people using.
When the potential risk is seen, the app not only recommends quantine in itself, but also alerts local health officials.The large data analyses in mobile phone data, face-to-face technology, mobile phone adherence and artificial intelligence are used to follow infected people and the people they have detected in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, Israel’s government moved security agencies to follow the mobile phone data of people who pretend to have a coronavirus.
The step was taken to enforce the cuwanrentennas and protect those people who might have attached themselves to infected mammals.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telecom distributed joint telephone location data to the federal government agency of the German government, Robert Koch Institute, to explore and suppress viral spread.
The Rusia spread facial recognition technology to catch the offender.

The German government conducted 48 hours of hackathon a weekend with over 42,000 participants.
Similarly Estonian president Kersti Kaljulaid carried out a worldwide call for creative solutions against coronavirus spread.
Individuals suffered anxiety from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of self-sufficiency.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, \"[The rising social disparity, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic collapse is a perfect storm for harming people's mental health and well-being--
The disease can have a mild course with little or no symptoms, similar to other common sores in the upper part of the noise such as the common cold.
Kind cases usually heal for two weeks, while you are those with serious or critical diseases can be reached for three to six weeks for recovery.
Punish women may be at higher risk of serious contaminating COVID-19 based data from other chain microbes, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can be associated with lungs that cause pneumonia.
In the most affected people, COVID-19 can spread rapidly to acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory swelling, septic shock or loss of many organs.
CoVID-19 complications include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and heart damage, kidneys and liver.
Irregular blood clotting, in particular the rise in prothrombin time has been described in 6% of people admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, as abnormal kidney function has been seen in 4% of this group.
Increasing 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show rising liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the middle time between onset of symptoms and death is ten days, five of which use hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of previous cases, the intermediate time from the release of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In China's National Health Commission (NHC) study, men have a death rate of 2.8% as women have a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of the death of lung samples showed damage to the diffuse alveolar with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Pneumocytes observed viral cytopathic changes.
The lung image is similar to acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% of death reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was detected by increased troponin or heart attack.
According to the March data from the United States, 89% of hospitals have previously had conditions.The availability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate from condition vary due to the differences in regions, but also due to the difficulties of predictability.
A low count of moderate cases can cause an overcrowding of the number of deaths.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by cases taken in the past can mean that the current death rate is insufficient to estimate.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require vigorous care or die compared to non-smokers.The worries are mentioned about long term sequence disorders.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority was able to detect a crash of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some of the people recovered from the disease and the lung scan suggested organ damage.
It can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known if the past infection provided effective and long-term survival of the disease to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the actions of other coronaviruses, but in cases where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by optimisation of testes for coronavirus at a later date recorded.
These cases were believed to be a long-term infection worse than reabsorbing.
The virus is thought to have originated naturally and originated from the animal, through the spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of infection was almost completely improved by contamination from man to man.
The study in the first 41 cases of signed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, exposed the earliest date of onset of symptoms on 1 December 2019.
Official publications from WHO reported that the earliest release of symptoms seems to be 8 December 2019.
Several steps are usually used to count the mortality rate.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of test, quality of health care system, treatment options, time from preliminary outbreak, and species of population such as age, gender, and general health.
In the latter part of 2019, WHO designated emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for those who died from laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for those who died from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2's lab infection. Ratio mortality-sa-sa-caso mirror the number of deaths divided in the number of diagnosed cases within the given interval.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the proportion of the worldwide death case was 6.9% (153,82/2,240,191) according to the 17th of April 2020.
The number changes per region. Other increases in case fatality rate (CFR), where the percentage of diagnosed indibidwals is shown who died from a disease, and the infaction fatality rate (IFR), where the percentage of infected indibidwals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) are shown who died from a disease.
These statistics are timeless and follow the definite population from contamination by resolution.
While not all people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
At the heart of the outbreak of disease in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) is dead.
In Grangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival pests, and spread to the younger population, causing relatively low mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally referred to as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not exhausted.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, such as is expected from blood donors.
Confirmed to have died from COVID-19 69 (0.004% of the population).
The effect of the pancreas and its mortality rate differ from that of men and women.
Male mortality rates were higher in developed studies in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50's age, with the stick between men and women closing only 90.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for this variation-sa-sex are unknown, but genetic and behavioral reasons can be a factor.
Differences in gender-based immunology, low prevalence of smoking in women and men developing similar adverse conditions such as hypertension in younger ages than in women may have become an outrage at higher mortality in men.
In Europe, men are 57% of individual infected and males 72% of COVID-19 deaths.
Starting April 2020, the US government is not following the data of COVID-19 gender-related infections.
Research has shown that infectious diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on men and women.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be »COVID-19-
WHO tree Tedros Adhanom Ghebreesus explained that CO represents for corona, VI for germ, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak of disease was first identified: 31 December 2019. 31 December 2019.
The name has been chosen to avoid resorting to a certain geographical location (for example, China), species of animals or groups of people, according to international naming recommendations aimed at preventing name-association.The germ causing COVID-19 has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Both are disease and germs are commonly referred to as αcoronavirus )
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, microbial and disease have been generally referred to as αcoronavirus α and α wohan coronvirus ααος αος αος αααος ααος ααος αος αααος ααααος αααααος ααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααα (ααααααα
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV chronic respiratory disease as temporary names for virus and disease according to 2015 guidance against the use of disease locations and viral names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity on standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print health care material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital was forced to have a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver at the required time, a local started a reverse outline and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial spread of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and incorrect information emerged about the origin, scandal, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread rapidly online.
Humans have emerged with the ability to spread the virus to some animals.
The study failed to see evidence of viral folding in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been prescribed to treat the disease.
International research into the vaccines and drugs at COVID-19 is carried out by government organizations, academy groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization began with the -SOLIDARITY Trial - in assessing the effects of treatment of four existing antiviral implants with expected validity.
No vaccine can be used, but different agencies actively promote vaccine candidates.
Former SARS-CoV actions are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use both ACE2 receptors for entering human cells.
There are three vaccination dischartes being investigated.
First, researchers aim to form a full viral vaccine.
The use of said microbes, whether they are inactive or dead, aims to gain an early immune response to the human body in a new COVID-19 infection.
A secondary strategy, vaccine subunits, aims to create a vaccine that suppresses the immune system in certain microbial subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research is focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
Third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new vaccine creation technique).
Experimental vaccines from any of their strategies will be examined for safety and validity.On the 16th of March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine was initiated on four Seattle volunteers.
The vaccines contain harmless genetic code copied from the virus causing disease.Efficiency dependent antibody is proposed as a potential challenge in the formation of the vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical tests currently being done as if April 2020.
Seven tests examine approved medicines for malaria, along with four studies in hyroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Anti-virus drugs given new use make up most Chinese research, when there are nine Phase III remedeivir tests in some countries that are expected to report at the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical progress for COVID-19 vaccines and medication candidates have been delayed, it seems April 2020. A few of the antiviral medications are examined for treatment of COVID-19, along with remedeivir, chloroquine, and hydroxyloquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir are classified in interferon beta.
This is temporary evidence for remedeivir's efficacy, until March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with compassionate-use remedeivir.
Phase III clinical trials were conducted in US, China and Italy.The chloroquine previously used in malaria treatment was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review in the research.
Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology advises that while recommending a daily dose of one gram, it is noted that the dose twice of it is extremely dangerous and potentially deadly.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued authorization for the emergency use of hydroxyloquine and chloroquine at the severity of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese guidelines also included interferon, lasavirin or menopavir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data has stated that high doses of satavirin are necessary to suppress SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for additional in vivo study after showing low concentration of SARS-CoV-2 restraint. Studies have shown that prioritization of the spike protein of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is meaningful for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The studies of chloroquine and hydroxyloquine that have and no azithromycin have limitations that have prevented the medical community from covering these therapies without additional study. Oseltamivir does not suppress SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and it has no known function in treating COVID-19.
Cytokinestorm can be complex in later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that the hydroxyloquine may have a characteristic of the anti-cytokinestorm.The tociizumab has been incorporated into the medical guidelines of China's National Health Commission after completing a small study.
This undergo a phase 2 of non-radomised analysis of the Italian national level after showing positive results to people with serious illness.
Combined with a serum fertilization test to teach cytokinestorms, it is designed to protest such consequences, which are thought to have caused some affected people to die.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by FDA based on the passing case of studies for treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome proposed by a different reason, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
Today, there is no reliable, controlled evidence that tocizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies formed by immune systems of people who have survived from COVID-19 to people in need is investigated as a method of no vaccineal immunization.
This strategy was tried for SARS with results not final.
Virus-neutralysis is the expected mechanism of action in which passive antibody therapy can intervene in defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms as well, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, can be possible.
Other types of unbiased antibody therapy, for example, the use of created monoclonal antibodies, are in the formation.
Blood production from the person who has recovered, consisting of a liquid blood component from patients who have recovered and contains an antibody that is particularly in this virus, can be consumed for faster distribution.
