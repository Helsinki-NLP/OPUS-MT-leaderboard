>>zsm_Latn<< The medium-size cat that is below it slaughters medium-sized animals, for example rabbits, antelopes and deer.
>>zsm_Latn<< Finally, there are many small cats (including past pet cats) that eat much more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
>>zsm_Latn<< Their secret of success is the concept of cirrhosis, the special work that each cat runs to keep them from competing with the other cats.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lions are the most social cat, living in a large group called prides.
>>zsm_Latn<< Prides consist of one to three adult males of siblings, along with 30 females and their children.
>>zsm_Latn<< The female is usually closely knitted to each other, as a large family of sisters and daughters.

>>zsm_Latn<< When a small group of living things (small population) are separated from the main population of its origin (such as if they move to mountains or rivers, or if they move to a new island so they can't easily return), they will often find a different environment than they did before.
>>zsm_Latn<< This new environment has different resources and competitors, so new populations need different features or adaptations to be able to be stronger competitors than they needed before.
>>zsm_Latn<< The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
>>zsm_Latn<< Over time, when new populations begin to adapt to its new environment, they seem to be getting less and less like other populations.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, both populations will seem so different that they cannot be called the same species.
>>zsm_Latn<< We call it the speciation process, which means the formation of a new species.Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
>>zsm_Latn<< Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they inhale the carbon dioxide that humans release (which means, breathe).

>>zsm_Latn<< Although no one knows exactly who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of a large parchment document (a size of 29α3–4 inches times 24¢1⁄2 inches) was rolled in order to be saved.
>>zsm_Latn<< So the notation is likely to be inserted only as a label.
>>zsm_Latn<< D-Day landing and the next battle had freed the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not free.

>>zsm_Latn<< The city countries are national colporteurs.The culture of civilization signifies the passage of knowledge over several generations, traces of the remaining culture, and reasonable spread.
>>zsm_Latn<< Minority culture usually vanishes without leaving relevant historical evidence and fails to be recognized as a worthy civilization.
>>zsm_Latn<< During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government â αα - with Congress as the only component of â πα εααααας under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to charge taxes, because there is no executive or national jurisdiction, Congress relies on state authority, which is often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
>>zsm_Latn<< It also has no authority to set aside tax regulations and rates between states.
>>zsm_Latn<< The articles require a round sound agreement from all states before it can be changed, whereas the states do not respect the central government so their representatives are often absent.

>>zsm_Latn<< For example, the world's most common photography format is 35 mm, which is the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until today is still produced, but more important is the aspect of radiation has been inherited by the digital camera image sensor format.
>>zsm_Latn<< The actual 35 mm format, rather confusing, has 36 mm wide and 24 mm tall.
>>zsm_Latn<< The ratio of this aspect of the format (divided twelve to obtain the simplest range of integers) then of it is said to be 3:2.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many common formats (e.g., APS format group) are equivalent or close to this aspect ratio.
>>zsm_Latn<< The one-third rule most often violated and underestimated is a simple guide that creates dynamism at once keeps order in an image.

>>zsm_Latn<< In fact, this place is not easy to find even when one knows that this place exists. Once it is in the cave, the condition is total isolation.
Nothing can be seen from the sky above, and the mountains around it, but only a few can be seen or heard from this cave.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Great Pyramid in Giza is the only one of the seven miracles that still stands up to date.
>>zsm_Latn<< Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid was one of many great pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
>>zsm_Latn<< The High Years of Giza, or -Necropolis Giza - in the Egyptian Valley have several pyramids (of which the great pyramids are the largest), some small tombs, some temples, and the great Sphinx.
>>zsm_Latn<< Large pyramids were created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wife and members of the Khufu family.
>>zsm_Latn<< -Fanda -row up - looks like the letter V and - sign of the bow down - like a staple or square that has no lower side of it ]
>>zsm_Latn<< Up means you should start from the end and push its bow, and down means you should start on the fret (which is where your hand holds its bow) and pulls its bow.
>>zsm_Latn<< The upward friction usually produces a softer sound, whereas the friction downwards are stronger and more firm.
>>zsm_Latn<< Feel free to write down your own mark, but there are musical reasons for the printed bow mark, so usually the sign should be obeyed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Feared King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Therese who was 11 years old and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, on October 6, 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by the mass of market women.
>>zsm_Latn<< With cars, they traveled back to Paris by surrounded by crowds of people shouting and calling for a threat to the King and Queen.
>>zsm_Latn<< The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their car window wides.
At one point, one of the members of the mob presented the head of the royal guard who was killed in Versailles before the frightened Queen.
>>zsm_Latn<< U.S. imperialist spending in conquering the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
>>zsm_Latn<< They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to finance most of the expenditures and bonds interest that floated on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banks.
>>zsm_Latn<< Exploitation obtained from prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people is certainly a basic advantage to U.S. imperialism.
>>zsm_Latn<< In order to understand Kesih, people must understand the context that prompted the creation of the command.
>>zsm_Latn<< The period of these events is usually called the High Middle Ages from the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th (1000â €-1300 M).
>>zsm_Latn<< The Middle Ages ran from the Early Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, which ended about 1500 based on the convention.
>>zsm_Latn<< Determinism is a term in which the practice includes a wide range of ideas, from the urge of technology or technology to a strict understanding that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic associated with scientific law as well as its manifestation of technology.
>>zsm_Latn<< ← Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two common ideas: that technology development itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influences, and that technology in the end has the α effect of being attached to society, not just socially conditioned--
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, one can say that a car should lead to road development.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, national highway networks are not economically feasible for a handful of cars alone, so new production methods are developed to reduce car ownership costs.
>>zsm_Latn<< The ownership of mass cars also led to the high rate of road accidents, which became the beginning of the discovery of new techniques in the health world to repair the body that suffered damage.
>>zsm_Latn<< Romanticism has a considerable element of cultural determinism, taken from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the context of Romanticism, geography forms individuals, as well as as over time emerge customs and cultures associated with that geography, and this, in accordance with the place of society, is better than arbitraryly enacted laws.
>>zsm_Latn<< Just as Paris is known as the capital of contemporary world fashion, Constantinople was once considered the capital of feudal European fashion.
>>zsm_Latn<< His fame as the center of luxury began from 400 to about 1100.
>>zsm_Latn<< His status suffered a setback in the twelfth century, particularly as a result of the Crusaders returned bringing gifts of silk and spices worth more than those of the Byzantine market offered.
>>zsm_Latn<< At that time Mother Mode was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10-11th century and in the 14th century.
>>zsm_Latn<< At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, as a result of slow communication channels, western styles can be left 25 to 30 years.
>>zsm_Latn<< The late Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop their own style, one of the largest developments at the time being the result of the Crusade, people began to wear hooks to tear clothes.
>>zsm_Latn<< Subsistent farming is a farm done to produce enough food to meet the needs of their farmers and families.
>>zsm_Latn<< Subsistent farming is a simple, usually organic system, and uses the stored seed of the ereegion origin, which is combined with both waxy planting and other techniques that are relatively cyclical in order to maximize harvest results.
>>zsm_Latn<< Historically, most farmers were involved in agricultural swasepambada and this is still taking place in many developing countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< The subculture unites the same thinking individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
>>zsm_Latn<< Subculture can be distinguished due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of its members.
>>zsm_Latn<< Quality determining a subculture differs from another could be language, aesthetic, religion, politics, sexual, geographic, or a combination of a number of factors.
>>zsm_Latn<< Subculture members usually mark their membership through the use of typical and symbolic style, of which modes, attitudes, and argots.
>>zsm_Latn<< One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take advantage of some poor cases of children who, due to deliberate cause, accident, or abuse, are not socialized by adults as they grow up.
>>zsm_Latn<< ← Children like that are called αferal  or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases the neglect of this child is caused by the rejection of parents against severe intellectual or physical disorders of a child-
>>zsm_Latn<< Children may have had severe harassment or trauma before being sent off or escaped.
>>zsm_Latn<< Others are thought to be raised by animals; some say they have lived in the wild on their own.
>>zsm_Latn<< When fully raised by nonhuman animals, wild children exhibit behavior (in physical boundaries) almost entirely like certain animals that take care of it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< When project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffold step further.
>>zsm_Latn<< Insurance is not a method of learning but is more an aid that provides support to individuals who are undergoing new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
>>zsm_Latn<< Insurance can be virtual and real-formed, in other words, a teacher is a scaffolding form but so is a small paper clamp character in Microsoft Office.
>>zsm_Latn<< Virtual appliances are internalized in software and aim to question, encourage, and explain procedures that may be too large a challenge to be broken by students themselves.
>>zsm_Latn<< Children were placed in the Refugee Place for various reasons, such as torture, torture, and even torture.
>>zsm_Latn<< Children should not grow in an environment that doesn't care, care for, and grieve, but the reality is that way.
>>zsm_Latn<< We consider the Home System to be a safe zone for these children.
>>zsm_Latn<< Our parenting system should provide secure homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
>>zsm_Latn<< Discipline should provide all the needs that are not at home where they were previously taken.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Internet is organising the elements of mass communication and interpersonality.
>>zsm_Latn<< The specific characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and a gratification approach.
>>zsm_Latn<< —Contruently, âlearning » and αsocialization - is recommended as an important motivation in Internet use (James dkk., 1995).
>>zsm_Latn<< ← Personal engagement  and ← ongoing relationships » are also identified as aspects of new motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigate the reaction of audiences to the website.
>>zsm_Latn<< Using video recorders leads to important discoveries of micro expression interpretation, facial movements, which occur in milliseconds count.
>>zsm_Latn<< Specifically, it is stated that we can detect if someone lies by observing his micro expression correctly.
>>zsm_Latn<< In his paper entitled The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks points out how someone who does not understand the speech as a result of suffering brain damage remains able to accurately assess the realities.
>>zsm_Latn<< He even proposes that the ability in interpreting such human behavior may be owned by animals such as pets.
>>zsm_Latn<< 20th century research showed that there were two genetic variations: hidden and revealed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mutations add new genetic variation, whereas selection removes it from the expression variation group.
>>zsm_Latn<< Segregation and recombination bend the variation back and forth between two pools with each generation.
>>zsm_Latn<< In sabana, it is difficult for primates with human-like digestive systems to meet the need for amino acids from the available nasal sources.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, failure in doing so has a serious impact, namely growth depression, nutritional deficiency, and ultimately death.
>>zsm_Latn<< The most readily available source of medicine is the protein that is in leaves and nuts, but it is difficult to digest for primates like us, unless already cooked.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, animal foods (semots, rayaps, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also give high amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
>>zsm_Latn<< With all things in mind, we should not be surprised when our ancestors address the protein - in a way that is almost similar to those of chimpanzees in the babana right now -
>>zsm_Latn<< Sleep disorders are the process you wake up intentionally during a normal sleep period, then fall asleep a few seconds later (10â €60 minutes).
>>zsm_Latn<< This can be easy to do by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to make you exhausted without fully waking up.
>>zsm_Latn<< If you restart the hour at sleep, then the hour can be put on the other side of the room, forcing you to stand up and turn it off.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another biorithm-based choice involves drinking a lot of liquid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before sleep, forcing people to wake up and urinate.
>>zsm_Latn<< The amount of inner peace a person has is correlated opposite to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
>>zsm_Latn<< The lower the voltage, the more positive the life force exists, each one has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can reach enlightenment, the only thing that hinders is our own tension and negative nature.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tibetan Buddhism wears a Buddhist teaching foundation, but then expands it with the attention of grace and with many techniques from Yoga India.
>>zsm_Latn<< Fundamentally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, standing on Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the way of love for all.
>>zsm_Latn<< With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (light energy) is resurrected through postur yoga, breathing exercises, spells, and visualization.
>>zsm_Latn<< The central meditation center of Tibetan citizens is the God of Yoga. Through visualization of various gods of the energy channel is cleared, the discs are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
>>zsm_Latn<< Germany was a joint enemy in the 2nd World War, which resulted in cooperation between the Soviet Union and the U.S. With the end of war and system conflict, process, and culture resulting in the fall of countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
>>zsm_Latn<< The war lasted until the next 40 years and would be fought in real, by proxy forces, in the warfields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other places.
>>zsm_Latn<< On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reset along the Romanian bridge.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, this plan became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian garda after attacking eastern areas of Poland that violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Agression Uncle, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
>>zsm_Latn<< Using ships to transport goods so far is the most efficient way to move people and goods by the number of many crossing the ocean.
>>zsm_Latn<< The task of the navy is traditionally ensuring that your country is able to maintain its ability in terms of people's movement and goods, and at the same time, hindering your enemy's ability in terms of the movement of people and its goods.
>>zsm_Latn<< One of the most important and most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in PDII.The Americans tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
>>zsm_Latn<< At the same time, the German navy, most of which used U-boats, once tried to prevent this congestion.
>>zsm_Latn<< If the Allies failed, Germany might be able to conquer England as well as other European countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< The goat seems to have begun to be tamed some 10,000 years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
>>zsm_Latn<< Culture and the ancient tribes began raising goats to make it easy to get the milk, fur, meat, and skin.
>>zsm_Latn<< The cattle tend to keep track of the herd wandering to hills or other shepherding areas.The goats tend to be used frequently by children or adults, similar to those more well-known by shepherds. This method of shepherding is still used to this day.
>>zsm_Latn<< Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
>>zsm_Latn<< Even though the railways are made up of only wooden boards in parallel, with this passage the horse can pull the train so that it is more rigid and pulls more load than a slightly more rough street at the same time.
>>zsm_Latn<< The rail pillow was introduced early in order to hold the track at its place, but it was slowly realized that the track would be more efficient when it had a layer of iron on its top.
>>zsm_Latn<< This became a common practice, but iron caused the wheel of wood on the train to be more quickly damaged.
Eventually, iron wheels were replaced by iron wheels, which in 1767 were born the first fully made of iron.
>>zsm_Latn<< The first known transport was walking, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright humans) two million years ago, humans began walking uprightly.
>>zsm_Latn<< Their predecessors, Australopithecus did not walk upright as usual.
>>zsm_Latn<< Specialization was found in the fossil Australopithcus of 4,2-3.9 million years ago, though Sahelanthropus may have been walking with two feet since seven million years ago.
>>zsm_Latn<< We can start living friendly with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists in order to reduce future impact.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases, however, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to disable it.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is quite clear that the world is growing due to science and technology, as well as overpopulation and human chaotic lifestyles become quite a problem.
>>zsm_Latn<< After adopted by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson brought some blocks to John Dunlap's printing store.
>>zsm_Latn<< During the night of about 150 to 200 exemplars were made, now known as -Dunlap broadsides -
>>zsm_Latn<< The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on the Independence Hall page on July 8.
>>zsm_Latn<< One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which read it to his army in New York on July 9.
The 25 known Dunlap copies are still the oldest copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that 1 dinosaur group is safe and alive today.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many people do not think that they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
>>zsm_Latn<< They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk with two hind legs such as T-Rex.
>>zsm_Latn<< Almost all computers currently used are based on manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
>>zsm_Latn<< The binary number can only have one of two values, that is 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits, as computer jargon.
>>zsm_Latn<< Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible.Suchings such as vomiting are quite common, so it can't be immediately made the diagnosis.
>>zsm_Latn<< The best indication of internal poisoning may be seen from the presence of open drug storage or toxic household chemicals.
>>zsm_Latn<< Check the first aid instruction label specific to specific poisons.
>>zsm_Latn<< The term insects are used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
>>zsm_Latn<< This term comes from past familiarity with foul lice, which is a compound insect that is easily adapted as parasites in humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< Good Killer Topics are the nidicolous animals, adapting to living in its nest or host's home.
>>zsm_Latn<< Throughout the United States, there are about 400,000 cases listed from Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which makes it a major neurological disease in young and middle age.
>>zsm_Latn<< MS is a disease that influences the center of the nervous system, which is formed from the brain, spinal nerves and vision nerves.
>>zsm_Latn<< Research found that women were twice as likely to be exposed to MS than men.
>>zsm_Latn<< The couple may decide that for the sake of their good, or the good of their child, to raise a child.
>>zsm_Latn<< This couple can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
>>zsm_Latn<< In adoption, the mother parents usurp their custody so that the other couple may be able to nurse the child.
The main target of science is to learn how the world works through scientific methods, and this method actually drives most scientific research.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is not alone, experimenting, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypothesis, ask questions, and make observations also guide scientific research.
>>zsm_Latn<< Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical text and specifically on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle’s view of all scientific problems, including psychology, has been accepted.
>>zsm_Latn<< As little interest in Greek knowledge grew, the West discovered that they were scattered from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many pay attention to rhythms in physiology and conduct often depend on the presence of the endogenous cycle and its production through biological clocks.
>>zsm_Latn<< The periodic rhythm, which is not just a response to external periodic cues, has been noted for most living things, including mushrooms, bacteria, animals, and plants.
>>zsm_Latn<< A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue a free running cycle period even when external cues are not present.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hershey and Chase's trials are one of the main proposals that state that DNA is genetic material.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hershey and Chase use the phag, or virus, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
>>zsm_Latn<< They have performed two experiments, that is to mark the DNA inside the fag with radioactive phosphor and mark the phag protein with radioactive sulfur.
>>zsm_Latn<< The effects of mutations can vary, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected pieces of genetic matter, and whether the cells affected are germ cells.
>>zsm_Latn<< Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to the child, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
>>zsm_Latn<< Natural-based tourism attracts people to the natural regions to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and plants.
>>zsm_Latn<< Examples of activity in locations include hunting, fishing, photography, observing birds, and visiting parks, as well as learning information about ecosystems.
For example, visit, pick up, and learn about the people who live in Kalimantan.
>>zsm_Latn<< Each morning, people leave the small town with a car to go to her place of work and get to know others whose work is the destination they have just left.
>>zsm_Latn<< In inter-empts which are these dynamic transports each person is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on a personal car.
>>zsm_Latn<< Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has freed the biosphere from one of its stable states that over the past two million years has supported human evolution.
Everyone is involved in the community and is using the transportation system, almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the developed country, you rarely hear the same level of complaint about water quality or bridge collapse.
>>zsm_Latn<< Why does such complaints arise against the transportation system, why do their services always fail? are transportation engineers not competent, or are there more fundamental things that are currently happening?
>>zsm_Latn<< The Linkas Path is the study of individual drivers' movements and vehicles between the two points and the interactions they create with each other.
>>zsm_Latn<< Unfortunately, learning traffic current is difficult to do due to driver's behavior is unpredictable with a percentage degree of certainty.
>>zsm_Latn<< Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic currents tend to have reasonable consistency and are less mathematically represented.
>>zsm_Latn<< To represent traffic currents better, it has been established the relationship between three main characteristics: (1) grooves, (2) density, and (3) speed.
>>zsm_Latn<< This relation helps in terms of planning, planning, and operation of highway facilities.
>>zsm_Latn<< Insects were the first animal to explore space, his flying ability helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mate more efficiently.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings parallel to the body.
>>zsm_Latn<< This gives them a wider choice for small sized places to hide from predators.
>>zsm_Latn<< Currently, the only insects that can't fold their wings are floats and float flies.
>>zsm_Latn<< Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System was moving around the Sun.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some people think he is right, but many believe otherwise; the Solar System includes the Sun (and even other stars) moving around the Earth.
>>zsm_Latn<< This seems reasonable, since the Earth doesn't feel like moving, doesn't it?
>>zsm_Latn<< The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, this river brings more 8x water from the second largest river.
>>zsm_Latn<< Amazon is also the most extensive river in the world, with a width of about 9.6 kilometers.
>>zsm_Latn<< As many as 20 percent of the water flowing from various rivers to the oceans on the planet comes from the Amazon.
>>zsm_Latn<< The main Amazon river was 6.387 km (3.980 miles). The river held water from thousands of small rivers.
>>zsm_Latn<< Despite the construction of pyramids with stone continues to the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and perfection of engineering from the construction of Giza pyramids is never surpassed.
>>zsm_Latn<< The New government of ancient Egypt admired its predecessors, who were then over a thousand years old.
>>zsm_Latn<< Vatican City population is about 800. This is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the lowest population.
>>zsm_Latn<< Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
>>zsm_Latn<< Italian is also a everyday language spoken by most people working in the country, whereas Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
>>zsm_Latn<< All citizens of the Roman Catholic Vatican City.
>>zsm_Latn<< People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times because all of this can be found in nature in its original form and are relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
>>zsm_Latn<< Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely soil, water, air, and fire.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is more like four properties of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although she also theorizes that they turn into new substances to form what we see.
>>zsm_Latn<< Basically mixed metals are a mixture of two metals or more.Remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
>>zsm_Latn<< Elements like calcium and potassium are metals, of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
>>zsm_Latn<< You can also have alloy metals containing small amounts of non-logam elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, all matter is made of small particles called atoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< The atomic size is small so that the point at the end point of this sentence can contain several trillions of atoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< During its appearance, pencils became good friends for many people.
>>zsm_Latn<< Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the status and use of degraded pencils.
>>zsm_Latn<< People now write messages on a computer screen, never having to use a divider.
>>zsm_Latn<< People can only wonder what the cube will be when something newer appears.
>>zsm_Latn<< Fire works on the principle that energy is needed to form an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart over the hill, kicking the nucleus again and then releasing some of that energy.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some atoms have unstable cores that mean atoms tend to break up with little or no touch.
The Moon's surface is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called crust.
>>zsm_Latn<< The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km on the nearest side.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the plateau.
>>zsm_Latn<< There may be more dark areas on the near side because the crust is thinner.Lahars are easier to climb to the surface.
>>zsm_Latn<< The theory of satisfaction centers on finding what makes people excited or interested in them.
>>zsm_Latn<< These various theories show that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they move on to adulthood.
>>zsm_Latn<< This theory analyzes the characteristics of people who make them want something, and factors in the environment that make them do or not do certain things.
>>zsm_Latn<< Two well-known charge theories are Maslow Needs Hiirki Theory as well as Histzberg's Two Factors Theory.
In general, two behaviors can appear when the manager begins to lead their former colleagues.
>>zsm_Latn<< Such managers have trouble taking unpopular decisions, performing disciplined actions, evaluation of performance, assigning responsibilities, and asking for people's accountability.
>>zsm_Latn<< At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual, who feels he must change everything the team has done and do it alone.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
>>zsm_Latn<< This behavior often leads to divisions between leaders and team members.
>>zsm_Latn<< Virtual teams have the same standards of superiority as conventional teams, but there are few differences.
>>zsm_Latn<< Virtual team members often serve as contact points for their direct physical group.
>>zsm_Latn<< They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their team may meet in accordance with various time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
>>zsm_Latn<< ← The fate tim of the sirens  Really (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
>>zsm_Latn<< - Tim simun - is a team of management in which each member is reporting.The invisible team sets standards for each member.
>>zsm_Latn<< Why would organizations want to go through a process that takes time in establishing learning organizations? one of the purposes of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
>>zsm_Latn<< When all available resources are used effectively throughout the functional departments of the organization, creativity, and intelligence can take place.
>>zsm_Latn<< As a result, the process of an organization that works together to address problems can bring up a new innovative process in order to serve the needs of the customer.
>>zsm_Latn<< Before the organization can be innovative, leadership must create innovation culture as well as sharing the science and learning of the organization.
>>zsm_Latn<< Angel (2006), explaining the Continuum approach as a method used to help the organization achieve higher performance levels.
>>zsm_Latn<< Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition investigation.Therefore, this data narrows the area of research and makes it much more precise.
>>zsm_Latn<< The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
>>zsm_Latn<< It has long been known that brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors impact behavior changes and some mental functions.
>>zsm_Latn<< The appearance of new technology allows us to look at and investigate structures and brain processes that have never been seen before.
>>zsm_Latn<< This gives us a lot of information as well as material in compiling simulation models that help us understand the process within our mind.
>>zsm_Latn<< Even though Making Intelligence has strong connotations of scientific fiction, Making Intelligence forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with conduct, learning and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
>>zsm_Latn<< Research in Creative Intelligence involves making machines to automate jobs that require intelligent behavior.
>>zsm_Latn<< Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnosis and customer questions, as well as the introduction of handwriting, voice and face.
>>zsm_Latn<< Things like these are already a separate discipline of science, which focuses on presenting solutions to real problems in life.
>>zsm_Latn<< AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and military, as has been built on some home computer applications and video gym software.
Darmpitata is an important part of the school, often a teacher happily takes his students to a place that can't use a bus.
>>zsm_Latn<< Technology offers a solution with virtual tourism. Students can see museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art as well as sit in their classroom.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sharing the works of tourism is also a good way to reflect on travel and sharing experiences with future classes.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, every year students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website on their journey to the state capital, each year the website is changed to its shape, but the old version remains stored online to be made a sample book.
>>zsm_Latn<< Blogs can also help improve student writing skills, while students usually begin to feel the experience of making blogs with less grammar and spelling, the existence of audiences generally changes it.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since learners are usually the most critical audience, blog writers start trying to improve the quality of writing in order to avoid criticism.
>>zsm_Latn<< ← In addition, blogs also - force students to be more literate about the world around them » The necessity to satisfy audiences inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004)
