How long have these symptoms lasted?
>>zsm_Latn<< And all chest pain should be dealt this way especially in your age
and together with fever
>>zsm_Latn<< and blood pressure as well as cholesterol you also need to check
And are you having a fever now?
And do you feel this chest pain now?
And do you also have difficulty breathing?
>>zsm_Latn<< and can you tell you about other symptoms you experience along with these symptoms?
And ever until how high is your fever?
And I'm coughing too.
And I'm a little picky and coughy.
And I feel heavy chest pain today
And this is the rhinitis allergy season
and feel chest pain
And I think I'm also a little fever.
And I want you to explain where your chest pain is
And they also had fever.
And with your diabetes history
And know you, my chest feels like it's going to be crushed.
And know you, people always cough towards me
And you feel chest pain
And you say that there's pressure in your chest
>>zsm_Latn<< anyone in the family who has heart problems, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
>>zsm_Latn<< Are there any symptoms or other problems that you notice along with muscle pain?
>>zsm_Latn<< Is there someone else who is sick like you at home with the same symptoms?
>>zsm_Latn<< Do you feel other symptoms?
Have you ever felt so full of breath?
Are you still feeling chest pain?
Because it's the flu season.
but we should also not limit chest pain from the heart
But the more important problem now is this chest pain
And I'm having difficulty breathing
But I know a lot of people coughing towards me.
but we have to deal with every chest pain very seriously
>>zsm_Latn<< but at the moment you can breathe properly?
I really forgot the cause of this chest pain
Does it feel like someone squeezes your chest?
Still felt like a breath.
are they complaining about the same symptoms?
>>zsm_Latn<< Do you have chronic problems such as high blood pressure or the like?
>>zsm_Latn<< Do you have medical problems or other chronic diseases such as diabetes?
Do you feel assassinated with the chest pain?
Are you suffering from high blood pressure?
Do you feel as though you are breathing all the time with those symptoms?
do you know what symptoms he is experiencing?
Did you see the picture?
Drink plenty of liquid today
However I have diabetes tests
But it has a kind of symptoms similar to mine
How high is your fever?
How's your blood pressure?
if your fever continues
If your fever is a hundred two or higher
>>zsm_Latn<< if you think symptoms or problems you need a better inspection
I got a fever yesterday.
I'm also a little fever.
I got a fever yesterday.
I'm feeling pain coming in here, in the chest.
I'm also having trouble breathing.
I'll send you pictures
I feel chest pain today
I just feel a little headache and fever today
In my opinion, it's a flu.
In my opinion, it's a little flu.
Does it feel like there's a very heavy person sitting in your chest?
>>zsm_Latn<< All start out of headaches with fever at almost the same time
Feels sick in my middle chest.
pressure like chest pain
On my chest
in the middle of my chest
>>zsm_Latn<< in the middle of the chest
I've had pain in my chest.
I'm so worried about this chest pain
I want you to explain this chest pain
>>zsm_Latn<< Like high blood pressure or diabetes
It's like right in the middle of the chest.
For his fever, you can drink sweet tachifirina
Mary, how many days have you experienced this symptom?
You say that you feel chest pain
sometimes I feel chest pain
All right, if there's any other symptoms with these symptoms besides pain
Or someone sitting in your chest?
>>zsm_Latn<< Nearly identical to fever, cough, headache, and muscle pain
Right in the middle of my chest
show me this picture where you feel sick
'Cause you have fever.
So, do you think some of these symptoms might be related to pregnancy?
So, your children have some of the same symptoms?
talk about your chest pain
fever rises at night
My fever has lasted for two days.
fever began to rise last night
This is a Porter doctor at the center of an emergency room triase.
Can you tell me more about your chest pain?
I feel pain in the front of my body, here, in the chest.
I feel a strong pain in my chest
when I felt the pain in my chest
>>zsm_Latn<< What kind of pain do you feel in your chest?
>>zsm_Latn<< When did this chest pain start?
>>zsm_Latn<< in which part do you feel pain in the chest?
>>zsm_Latn<< in which part do you feel chest pain?
You feel like suffocating in your chest
Do you know I suffer from diabetes and other diseases?
You say that you feel this chest pain
>>zsm_Latn<< The cumulative incident of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that increased rapidly in the European Union/Europe Economic Area and Great Britain, January 1 to March 15, 2020
>>zsm_Latn<< The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European/European Economic Areas and Great Britain confirm that, although the stage is different depending on the state, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very rapidly in all countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< Based on the experience of Italy, the country, hospitals, and intensive care unit should increase its readiness for the increase of COVID-19 patients who will require health care, particularly intensive care.
>>zsm_Latn<< On December 31, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
>>zsm_Latn<< On January 9, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China reported the causative agent of this disease was a new coronavirus now called the coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
>>zsm_Latn<< Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections have been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
>>zsm_Latn<< Evidence to date shows that about 80% of COVID-19 sufferers experience mild disease, namely respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, with most of these sufferers cured.
>>zsm_Latn<< In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease and requires hospital care, while 6% of the other cases experience a critical disease requiring intensive care.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mortality of patients treated in hospitals due to COVID-19 about 4%.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this study, we studied the trend of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 states of the European Union/EEA Economic Area (EU/EA) and Great Britain (UK) then compared it to an incident in Hubei Province, China.
>>zsm_Latn<< We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries with the number of cases in Italy during January 31 - 15 March 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< Case of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
>>zsm_Latn<< After China, COVID-19 experienced further geographical dispersal and the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in other parts of the world today follow the pandemic dynamics in China.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 11, 2020, Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< In Eurosurveillance 2020 of March 5, Spistere et al. reported the first Europeans with COVID-19 cases confirmed based on WHO's case definition.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 on people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 15, 2020, the case of COVID-19 had been detected throughout 30 EU/EEA and Ingris Raya (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with that date including, there were 39.768 cases and 1.727 deaths reported, with 17.750 cases and 1.441 deaths from Italy alone.
>>zsm_Latn<< Getting a cumulative number and a cumulative incident case COVID-19
>>zsm_Latn<< At the European Disease Prevention and Control Center (ECDC), the amount of COVID-19 cases that each country across the world was informed were updated every day at 8.00. This amount was obtained only from official sources such as the country's Health Sustainability, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
>>zsm_Latn<< This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as compare it to trends in Italy.
>>zsm_Latn<< As the prevalence proxy of the active COVID-19 case, we calculate a cumulative incident dated 14 days, so take into account the natural travel of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK country, in the January 1 -15 period of March 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< We also present a cumulative case number that each country was informed to March 15 2020 at 8.00 compared to the Italian case during the January 31th -15Maret 2020 period.
>>zsm_Latn<< COVID-19 Train in EU/EEA and UK countries
>>zsm_Latn<< The cumulative incident trend is dated 14 days of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries generally follow trends in Hubei Province (Tikkok) (Gambar 1).
>>zsm_Latn<< For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase about February 21, then increased sharply about February 28, 2020 (Addernal texts).
>>zsm_Latn<< This trend was primarily triggered by a rapid increase in reported number of cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a trend of a similar cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (An additional one).
>>zsm_Latn<< Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries compared to the number of cumulatives in Italy during the January 31 -15 period of March 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< The data highlights that, up to March 15th at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less than that.
>>zsm_Latn<< Our results indicated that the amount of COVID-19 cases informed increased rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
>>zsm_Latn<< The trend observed at the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 signaled that the pandemic increases at comparable speeds in all countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is despite the difference in the stages that countries experience, variations in public health response, and possible differences in case definition between state and protocol differences to choose patients who must be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
>>zsm_Latn<< In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region explained the situation of about 10% of COVID-19 patients need intensive care and media sources report that hospitals and intensive care units in this region have reached its maximum capacity.
>>zsm_Latn<< Currently, the acceptance data of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units at the EU/EA level are only available for each 6% and 1% cases (data is not shown).
>>zsm_Latn<< However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete current surveyal data that focuses on the number of cases reported and death figures.
>>zsm_Latn<< The study conducted in 2010-2011 showed a great variation in the availability of intensive care beds and the care of bodies in Europe, ranging from 29,2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 populations in Portugal.
>>zsm_Latn<< This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive treatment beds and treatment of hosts per 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
>>zsm_Latn<< Modeling scenarios associated with the saturation of health care capacity, with the estimation of prevalence of COVID-19 cases of infertility for each EU/EEA and UK countries associated with risk >90% beyond the capacity of intensive treatment beds, provided in the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< Because as far as the case is ranked in certain regions in the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals as well as intensive care units usually serve a specific regional service coverage population, information about cases and intensive treatment beds is best provided at the regional Unit Name level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
>>zsm_Latn<< The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very quickly in the US/EEA and the UK.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, the state, hospital, and intensive care unit should prepare for SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenarios and the improvement of the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, particularly intensive care, as it occurs in the affected region of Italy.
>>zsm_Latn<< As shown in the recent rapid risk assessment of ECDC, a quick, proactive, and comprehensive approach is crucial to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the transition from the protective approach to mitigation, due to the rapid increase in number of cases, as anticipated, may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept, and adapt the proper response if it is not applied before.
>>zsm_Latn<< The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< There is a short opportunity window as the state has the possibility of improving its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
>>zsm_Latn<< If failed, another EU/EEA state health care system will likely face an increase in patients requiring intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
>>zsm_Latn<< The outbreak of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed over 3,000 people and infects more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, which has led to disasters for humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< Similar to his homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which led to SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, COVID-19 has a lower degree of severity and Mortality than SARS, but is more infectious and more about elderly than young people, as well as more on men than women.
>>zsm_Latn<< In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this newly emerging disease, this article tries to provide timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly growing research subject.
>>zsm_Latn<< We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although we still have many unanswered questions, we hope that this review will help us to understand and deal with this threatening illness.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unforgettable and memorable memory for all Chinese people who were instructed to stay at home during vacation and a few weeks after it was due to the outbreak of a new virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< This virus was very homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) which caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease it caused was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
>>zsm_Latn<< Epidemies started in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread throughout the country and to almost 50 other countries around the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until March 2, 2020, this virus has resulted in 80,000 COVID-19 cases confirmed, with over 40,000 patients being returned and 3,000 patients died.
>>zsm_Latn<< Warning that COVID-19 is the voracious enemy of number 1 - and potentially destructively more powerful than terrorism.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that established isolated viral sequences from some patients, more than 200 papers have been published about COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and its treatments.
>>zsm_Latn<< This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in this rapidly growing new subject field.
>>zsm_Latn<< As possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, namely Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
>>zsm_Latn<< We will also discuss what has been learned so far about prevention and prognosis of disease as well as some other yet unanswered questions, but urgent.
>>zsm_Latn<< Based on tradition, CoV is considered nonletal pathogens for humans, especially causing about 15% of pickles 4.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, in this century, we have found a very pathogenic CoV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing an outbreak that started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with horror and morbidity.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
>>zsm_Latn<< As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the pneumonian cluster with unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
>>zsm_Latn<< Seven days later, CoV sequences were launched.
>>zsm_Latn<< On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
>>zsm_Latn<< Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< On January 20, the infection of health care providers was reported, which signaled that human-to-human transmissions might occur.
>>zsm_Latn<< On January 23, the territory quarantine was imposed in the city of Whanan and the entire public transport was discontinued.
>>zsm_Latn<< On January 24, the first clinical study of this disease reported that, from 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients were directly contacted with the Wahan seafood market considered to be the initial location of infection from unknown animal sources.
>>zsm_Latn<< On January 30, WHO declared this outbreak to be a global health emergency.
>>zsm_Latn<< By the time this report was written, it had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).2).
>>zsm_Latn<< Because the situation develops very quickly, the final coverage and severity of the plague must still be set.
>>zsm_Latn<< On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study on 8.866 patients, which included 4.021 COVID-19 patients confirmed, presented the following more updated epidemi imagery (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at the age of 30-65.
>>zsm_Latn<< Almost half (47.7%) of infected people are over 50 years old, few are under 20 years of age, and only 14 are infected under 10 years of age.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 more infects men (0,31/100,000) than women (0,27/100,000).
>>zsm_Latn<< COVID-19 extends in the cluster, especially inside and around Hubei.
>>zsm_Latn<< HVID-19 takes an average time of 5 (2-9) days from song to diagnosis.
>>zsm_Latn<< The average incubation period is 4.8 (3,0-7,2) days.
>>zsm_Latn<< The average time from song to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) day.
>>zsm_Latn<< The basic reproduction rate (R0) is 3,77 (95% CI: 3,51-4,05) and R0 is 2,23-4,82.
>>zsm_Latn<< The number of people infected increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, corresponding to the time of massive transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mortality of patients with a confirmed case of 1.44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%) and customized mortality for all patients by 3.06% (95% CI: 2,02-4,59%).
>>zsm_Latn<< Three major risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (man), age (€60), and weight pneumonia.
>>zsm_Latn<< CoV is a subfamily of a large coverd virus that contains a single strand of RNA sequence.
>>zsm_Latn<< CoV can be divided into four genus, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< Glycoprotein bumps or spikes (S) cover binds to its cell receptor, angiotensin exchange enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and peptide peptide peptide 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
>>zsm_Latn<< RNA genomes are released into the cytoplasm; after replication of viral genomes, genomic RNA is accompanied by the glycoprotein cover and nucleopasid proteins form a vesicle containing virion, which then undergoes fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were reported on January 10, 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 is a new beta-CoV type with a genetic similarity of more than 99.98% of the 10 sequenced samples; the sample is taken from the site of the outbreak's origin, namely the Huan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
>>zsm_Latn<< Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in the very thin part of the epithelium of human breath channels.
>>zsm_Latn<< ACE2 humans are found to be receptors for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, S SARS-CoV-2 proteins bind to ACE2 humans are weaker than their bonds to S SARS-CoV proteins, which correspond to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes non-parse infections of SARS-CoV in patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins that are encoded with orf3b and proteins secreted with orf8 passwords.
>>zsm_Latn<< The protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional or motive domain.
>>zsm_Latn<< On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete cryo-EM ACE2 structure of humans at the resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with amino acid transporters B0AT1.
>>zsm_Latn<< They found that complexes, which have open and closed conformations, are arranged forming dimers and complexes of ACE2-B0AT1 can bind to two S proteins, which are evidence for recognition and CoV infections.
>>zsm_Latn<< B0AT1 can be made therapeutic targets in drug filtering to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< The mother of origin and intermediate
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each transmitted to humans through worms and camels.
>>zsm_Latn<< Through the analogy of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, the intermediate host that helps the virus cross species barriers to infect humans is still unknown, and the transmission route must still be explained.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ji, et al. proposed a snake as a carrier of viruses from bats to humans involving homologous recombination within the S protein.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that marginalized, long-term mammals commonly used in traditional Chinese drugs, potentially as an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of genetic homology on CoVs found in marginal and SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, 1% of the difference spread throughout the genome is still a great difference; therefore, the conclusive result as concrete evidence is still not obtained (Gbr. 3).
>>zsm_Latn<< The physics nature of SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown.
>>zsm_Latn<< In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and moisture 40%-50%.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant containing chlorine, permeable acid, chloroform, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidin, effectively disables viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< Generally, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is susceptible to this new virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< Currently, no detailed studies report on immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, we can only refer to other CoV research prior, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).4).
>>zsm_Latn<< In general, after invasive host, the virus is identified by the built-in immune system through pattern identifier (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
>>zsm_Latn<< Through different pathways, viruses induce expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and interferon synthesis of type I (IFN) which restrict the spread of viruses and accelerate viral antigen phagocytosis by macrophages.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, the N protein on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune response.
>>zsm_Latn<< Soon thereafter, adaptive immune responses joined in the battle against this virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< T, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this defense.
>>zsm_Latn<< T cells CD4+ stimulates B cells to produce antibodies that are specific to the virus, and T cells CD8+ kill infected cells directly.
>>zsm_Latn<< T cells produce proinflamatory cytokines to help protect cells.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
>>zsm_Latn<< Humoral immunity, which includes complements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, isolated antibodies from already cured patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce a large number of locally free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, on the worst scenario, failure of compound organs and even death.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 infection, marked by song claster, is more about elderly with chronic diseases and pregnant women.
>>zsm_Latn<< Generally, the person exposed to the virus in large numbers or whose immune function is interrupted has a higher risk of infection than others.
>>zsm_Latn<< Estimation of the average SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on the study of 425 first cases in Wuhan.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
>>zsm_Latn<< A newer study, as described above, shows that the period of incubation 4.8 (3,0-7,2) days based on the 8.866 case demographics.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is essential that health authorities adjust the time of quarantine effectively based on the most accurate incubation period thus preventing an infected person, but without symptoms, transmitting the virus to others.
>>zsm_Latn<< As a common practice, people exposed to viruses or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
>>zsm_Latn<< Should quarantine time be extended up to 24 days?
>>zsm_Latn<< fever is often a major and initial symptoms of COVID-19, with or without being accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, suffocating breath, muscle pain, stomach pain, headaches, throat pain, dynore, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some patients suffer from dyspnea and/or hypoposemia a week after the attack of the disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< In a severe case, the development of the patient's disease takes place quickly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acid, and coagulopathy.
>>zsm_Latn<< Patients with fever and/or symptoms of acute breathing and fever, although without pulmonary imaging disorders, should be diagnosed with the virus for early diagnosis.
>>zsm_Latn<< A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that a percentage of symptoms of 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilator support.
>>zsm_Latn<< Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies, namely studies on family classmates and classmates caused by transmissions from asymptomatic people.
>>zsm_Latn<< Compared to that, a study of demographics in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also suffered from fever (98%), dry coughs (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their primary symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher MERS legitimacy than COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< Diare (26%) and throat disease (21%) are also observed in MERS patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat disease (13-25%) are shown as major symptoms and ventilation support are needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until February 14, COVID-19 morbidity of 2% with confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
>>zsm_Latn<< Compared to that, the quality of SARS in November 2002 by 10% of the 8.096 case confirmed.
>>zsm_Latn<< For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, a 37% mortality of 2.494 cases was confirmed.
>>zsm_Latn<< The previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached a height of 6,47 with a trust interval (CI) 95% by 5,71-7,23, while R0 SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
>>zsm_Latn<< A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, morbidity, and R0 are given in Table 1.
>>zsm_Latn<< The numbers show that SARS-CoV-2 has higher spreading capabilities compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as fast as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, the challenge of controlling SARS-CoV-2 pandemics is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
>>zsm_Latn<< Classed branches are often found in one family or from a group or vehicle such as a passenger ship.
>>zsm_Latn<< Patients often have travel stories or live in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before the singing.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, it is reported that people can carry viruses without showing symptoms over two weeks and patients returned from the hospital can carry the virus again.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the early stages, patients had either a count of white blood cells perifer (especially lymphocytes) normal or decreased.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, lymphopenia with the count of white blood cells < 4×109/L, which includes the lymphocytes count < 1×109/L, and the rate of aminotransferase aspartate as well as increased viremia was found at 1.099 COVID-19 patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< The levels of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin increase in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and blood deposit rates increase in most patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer rate increases, namely fibrin waste products that are in the blood, and the lymphocyte count decreases progressively.
>>zsm_Latn<< Photo abnormalities are found in large amounts of COVID-19 patients and are marked with bilateral cloud shadows or ground-glass optimizations in the lungs.
>>zsm_Latn<< Patients often experience a thin pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury, and acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
>>zsm_Latn<< When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly exacerbates gas exchange disorders.
>>zsm_Latn<< The pneumocytes type I and type II dysfunction lowers the surface pressure and thus lowers the lung's ability to expand and increase the risk of pulmonary corruption.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, the worst findings in thorax photos are often parallel to the most severe disease levels.
>>zsm_Latn<< On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocytes deformation, the formation of a hialin membrane, and interstitial lymphocytes infiltration, as well as the synsitial cells committed much in the patient's lungs that died of this disease, in accordance with viral infection pathology and ARDS as well as pathological analysis of SARS patients and MERS.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, due to the high level of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relied only on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< Similar situations also occur in SARS diagnosis.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, a combination between history of disease, clinical manifestation, laboratory trials, and radiologic findings is essential and is a must to make effective diagnosis.
>>zsm_Latn<< On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the protocol use of STHERLOCK-based techniques CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects the RNA fragments SARS-CoV-2 synthetics at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a folding stick in less than an hour without requiring complicated instrumentation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hopefully, this new technique can greatly increase sensitivity and ease if verified on clinical samples.
>>zsm_Latn<< Due to a lack of experience with new CoV, doctors primarily offer support care to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that were once used or proposed for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).2).
>>zsm_Latn<< This therapy includes current existing therapy and potential therapy with antivirus drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasmas from already healed patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
>>zsm_Latn<< Even plasma from a recovering patient is proposed for use in therapy.
>>zsm_Latn<< Pharmaceutical companies develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs expressing ACE2 in lower levels, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and the main cause of death.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, breathing support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be supported with extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is a modified cardiopulmonary shortcut technique used for the treatment of heart failure or life-threatening breathing.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of vital organ function is also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< The excessive immune system reaction is known to result in cytokine storms in SARS patients and MERS.
>>zsm_Latn<< The cytokin storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response marked by the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNFα, IL1-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNβ, and MCP-1.
>>zsm_Latn<< These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and the failure of compound organs.
>>zsm_Latn<< Immunocompression is very important in the handling of the cytokine storm, especially in severe patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< Corticosteroids and Tociizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, has been used to handle the cytokine storms.
>>zsm_Latn<< Other immunosuppression handling for the cytokin storms includes the modulation of immune responses directed by the T cells; the blocking of IFN-α, IL-1, and TNF; the inhibition of JAK; blintumobab; the pressure of the cytokin signal 4; and the HDAC inhibitors.
>>zsm_Latn<< Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, steroids on high doses are not useful for heavy lung injury in SARS patients and COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, steroids can result in heavy side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which strongly influences prognosis.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, giving short corticosteroids at low to moderate doses is encouraged to be carefully administered in critical COVID-19 patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< At the time of writing this review, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, intravena remedeivir-giving, which is a nucleotide analog, is found to be nutritious in a COVID-19 patient from America.
>>zsm_Latn<< Remdesivir is a new antivirus drug developed by Gilead, re-for treatment of disease caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< Later, remedeivir also showed an inhibition of other single strand RNA viruses, which included MERS and SARS viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< Based on this, Gilead provided this compound for China to perform a series of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the results were highly anticipated.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, baccitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lapivirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute breathing symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< Diare, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side reactions can occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
>>zsm_Latn<< This interaction of therapy with other drugs that the patient uses should be carefully monitored.
>>zsm_Latn<< Plasma of the already cured patient and the making of antibodies
>>zsm_Latn<< There is a long history of patient blood collection that is already cured of infectious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from being exposed to the disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< Indeed, patients who are already cured often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
>>zsm_Latn<< Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced lymphocytes B to fight pathogens as well as other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules on pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
>>zsm_Latn<< Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of already cured patients from COVID-19 and injected into 10 severely ill patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by a decrease in inflammatory and viral burden as well as increased oxygen accuracy in the blood.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, verification and clarification need to be done to submit the method for large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effect, some deficiencies related to plasma should be considered carefully.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, antibodies can stimulate immune responses excessively and cause cytokin release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
>>zsm_Latn<< The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and plasma is needed in large amounts to care for critical patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< Development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to counter the global epidemic is difficult to do.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from already cured patients and identify genetic codes that encode antibodies effectively or perform effective filtering antibodies against proteins that are important for viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this way, we can easily increase the production scale of antibodies.
>>zsm_Latn<< TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
>>zsm_Latn<< The effect, however, largely depends on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most effective components are still unknown or not yet clear because it is difficult to extract or verify that component or its optimal combination.
>>zsm_Latn<< Currently, because effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 has not yet existed, TCM becomes one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and capsules of Lian Hua Qing Wen are found encouragement for COVID-19 therapy.
>>zsm_Latn<< The top level of recovery in COVID-19 patient therapy is observed in some Chinese provinces that use TCM at 87% of its patients, which includes Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which uses TCM only at about 30% of its patients COVID-19, has the lowest rate of recovery (13%).
>>zsm_Latn<< However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of the patient, should be included in the evaluation.
>>zsm_Latn<< On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends participated in a study that compared western drug therapy (WM) only with combined therapy of WM and TCM.
>>zsm_Latn<< They found that the time required for the recovery of body temperature, loss of symptoms, and inap treatment was very much shorter in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
>>zsm_Latn<< More impressively, the level of symptom hunting (from mild to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group only (7.4% than 46.2%) and lower morbidity in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, the ethics and security of TCM still await controlled trials better on a larger scale and in more research centers.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another interesting thing is to characterize working mechanisms and clarify effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most patients suspected or confirmed COVID-19 feel extremely afraid of this highly contagious and even lethal disease, and the person who is quarantined also feels boredom, loneliness, and anger.
>>zsm_Latn<< Further, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and side effects of therapies such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor disturbances, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even susidity have been reported.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tracking a mandatory contact history and quarantine, as part of the public health response to COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and feel guilty related to the effects of infectious, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected people, and those who contact them, as well as the general public in need.
>>zsm_Latn<< Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and therapy plans as well as the use of professional devices and electronic applications to avoid contact near each other.
>>zsm_Latn<< Effective vaccines are very important to burst the transmission chain from animal reservoirs and humans infected to vulnerable hosts and are often equipped with antivirus therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by viral exposure.
>>zsm_Latn<< Efforts have been made to develop protein-based vaccines of S, which in the long run and effectively make the antibodies of attraction and/or immunity protecting against SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< For SARS, the living-weaked vaccine has been evaluated on experimental animals.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, the emulation in vivo of these vaccine candidates on the elderly and the model of letal challenges as well as its protection against zoonotic virus infections still had to be determined before clinical studies began.
>>zsm_Latn<< This may be because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
>>zsm_Latn<< Instead, the case of sporadis and MERS clasters continued to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in the endemic area.
>>zsm_Latn<< The vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS by using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and has partly been evaluated in experimental animals.
>>zsm_Latn<< The development of vaccines against the safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 for non-imun people is a very urgent and important task of controlling the ongoing epidemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, this difficulty is not easily overcome due to a long time of developing vaccines ( average 18 months) and dynamic CoV variations.
>>zsm_Latn<< As a new disease, COVID-19 just began showing its full clinical journey to thousands of patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< In most cases, patients can flow well without sequela.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and morbidity in patients with heavy cases.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, the formation of the disease prognosis model is crucial to the health care agency in order to prioritize its services, particularly in areas with limited resources.
>>zsm_Latn<< Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
>>zsm_Latn<< Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< COVID-19 occurs mainly at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age in the study contain 8.866 cases as described above.
>>zsm_Latn<< Patients in need of intensive care tend to have the comorbidity of the wealthy and complications as well as significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (median age 66 years than 51 years), which signals age as a prognostic factor for the final outcome of COVID-19 patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< Gender: SARS-CoV-2 more infects men than women (0.31/100,000 than 0.27/100,000), as described above.
>>zsm_Latn<< Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care have more likely to experience acute heart injuries and arithmia.
>>zsm_Latn<< The heart's event also facilitates the main reason for death in SARS patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be able to bind to colangiocyte with ACE2-positive, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is important to note that the age and underlying disease are highly correlated and can influence each other.
>>zsm_Latn<< Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein levels (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammatory or tissue injury and are proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
>>zsm_Latn<< The correlation between CRP levels and severity as well as COVID-19 prognosis has also been proposed.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), aminotransferase can also help predict the final outcome.
>>zsm_Latn<< These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and released during tissue damage.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
>>zsm_Latn<< Main clinical symptoms: thorax photos and development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict the final outcome and complications of COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are numerously used immunosuppressants as long-term therapy for infection disease in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since high dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many people who survive this disease end up suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and short-term centuries in COVID-19 patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer tremendous stress because they have to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< Psychological counseling and long-term support should be given to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
>>zsm_Latn<< Based on the studies of demographics so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological image with SARS.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the initial phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause pickles.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, in the initial phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce a large amount of virus during daily activity, which creates great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, SARS-CoV transmissions are believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most do not occur in the early phase.
>>zsm_Latn<< Thus, COVID-19 outbreaks are currently much more severe and difficult to control than SARS outbreaks.
>>zsm_Latn<< Currently, great efforts are being made in China, which includes the CANntina region of Whanan and surrounding cities as well as the sustainable quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of shutting down SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although this act greatly damaged the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients declined, which indicated the decline of the epidemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< The most optimistic estimation states the outbreak would end in March and the decline phase lasted for 3-4 months.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, some of the other experts are not as optimistic as they are.
>>zsm_Latn<< Paul Hunter et al. affirms that COVID-19, which seems much more infectious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ira Longini, et al. makes a model to predict the end result of the epidemic and states that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of the global population.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-conca conversations and throats of patients who were already cured and returned from hospital 2 weeks earlier. This suggests that re-emerged viruses can be a recurring episode, similar to influenza.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, promising signs occur in China, if seen based on a decline in the number of new cases, which shows that current strategies may be successful.
>>zsm_Latn<< The reproducible Ebola will lead to one million cases with half also death.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, with quarantine and strict isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
>>zsm_Latn<< Perhaps as well, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappears or becomes a virus not too pathogen that can be associated with humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< A comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Gbr. 5).
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit through cough or comb, and may also through direct contact with materials contaminated by viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< The virus is also found in the fases so that it brings up the possibility of new transmissions, namely the feces-to-mouth transmission.
>>zsm_Latn<< Recent studies in 138 cases report that 41% of cases may be caused by nosomial infections, which include 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health care providers.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, careful precautions must be taken to protect humans, particularly health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even people who happen to contact patients or infected people.
>>zsm_Latn<< The first defense line that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (a series number of 1860s) help control viral spread.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mask keeps the lubricating of a potentially infected person out of contact with air or attaching to the surface of the material, where the lubrication can be passed on to others.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, only the N95 mask (a series number of 1860s) can protect against the inhalation of virion with a small size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virions can be fully reactive; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both of which are about 85 nm.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since the particles can synthesize even five surgical masks that are stacked into one, the health care providers that directly contact the patient must wear the N95 (a series number of 1860s) and not a surgical mask.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to the mask, health care providers must wear appropriate isolation cloaks to further reduce contact with the virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< Virus can also infect a person through the eye.
>>zsm_Latn<< On January 22, 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 infected doctor even though he wore an N95 mask; the virus might enter his body through eye inflammation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, health care providers must also wear a face shield of sighted face or glasses while working with patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended for each person to wash his hands with a dissected soap more often than usual, try to stay at home in order to use self-sufficiency quarantine, and avoid contact with a potentially infected person.
>>zsm_Latn<< The three-foot distance is believed to be appropriate for keeping the distance from the patient.
>>zsm_Latn<< These acts are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection as well as preventing viral spread.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must be a great warning for China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Whanan Disease Control Center calmed the population by saying that this new virus has a low spreading nature and limited reproductive capacity from man to man and prevention and the prevention of the disease is not a problem.
>>zsm_Latn<< This message was very soothing to the fears of the community, especially as the whole country was preparing the Spring Festival, so this critical time was passed to contain a small-scale disease in Wuhan.
>>zsm_Latn<< The disease control agency in China should pick up lessons from this and make great improvements in the future.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, this body should (1) be more cautious as making public announcements because each word is noticed by the residents and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to the information not normal of the clinic than wait for official reports from the doctor or officer in charge; (3) more restricting the potential of epidemics at the early stage, and not trying to appease the public; and (4) more often issue targeted and effective exercise in order to increase public awareness of the epidemic of disease and test as well as to improve the community response system of the periodic response.
>>zsm_Latn<< COVID-19 outbreaks were caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to plague in late December 2019.
>>zsm_Latn<< In less than 2 months, the plague had spread throughout China and over 50 countries in the world at the time of writing this review.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, COVID-19 outbreaks affect like SARS outbreaks are repeated.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, there are some obvious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important for protecting epidemics and dealing with patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< COVID-19 is more about elderly than young people and more about men than women, as well as mortality rates are also higher in elderly compared to young people.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS Mortality is higher than COVID-19 modality (10.91% than 1.44%).
>>zsm_Latn<< COVID-19 patients transmit viruses even when they are without symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit viruses as they are seriously ill. This makes a greater difficulty in preventing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
>>zsm_Latn<< This explains some of the reasons SARS-CoV-2 spread faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< Regular RNA training for checking SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results to some COVID-19 patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, patients who are already cured can give more positive results to viral examinations.
>>zsm_Latn<< This finding greatly increases the risk of viral spread.
>>zsm_Latn<< With such rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important problems still have to be solved, that is:
>>zsm_Latn<< Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
>>zsm_Latn<< Although found a genetic homology of 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs similar to bat-SARS, we are still unable to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
>>zsm_Latn<< What animal is the intermediate species to transmit viruses from the original host, say bat, to humans?
>>zsm_Latn<< Without knowing the answer number 1 and 2, we cannot shut down transmission effectively and outbreaks can replan at any time.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although molecular modeling and biochemical sensations show that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter into the respiratory tract cells and result in subsequent pathological changes?
>>zsm_Latn<< Does this virus bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs as well?
>>zsm_Latn<< Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis as well as effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
>>zsm_Latn<< How does the virus evolve genetically during transmission between humans?
>>zsm_Latn<< Will this pancreas be a worldwide pandemic, ending like SARS, or being repeated periodicly like flu?
>>zsm_Latn<< The answer to the above question and many other statements is very important, but it may take time to find them.
However, no matter what the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to a normal life.
>>zsm_Latn<< The origin of the zoonotic virus of human crown
>>zsm_Latn<< For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved the co-evolution of the crown virus (CoV) and its host, including humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoV) were known to cause mild diseases, such as selemma.
>>zsm_Latn<< The acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverses the state and reveals how HCoV infections can be very destructive and life threatening.
>>zsm_Latn<< The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in central China by the end of 2019 has made CoV a highlight back and surprised us with a high transmission, but with a lower pathogenesis compared to his brother, SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< HCoV infection is zoonosis, therefore, understanding of the origin of HCoV will benefit us.
Most HCoVs come from bats.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mother reservor intermediates some HCoVs have also been known.
>>zsm_Latn<< The identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
>>zsm_Latn<< The investigation of CoV-ining interactions in animals can also provide important insights about CoV pathogenesis in humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this review, we present a general picture of the current knowledge of seven HCoV, with a focus on its invention history as well as its zoonotic origin and its interspecies transmission.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most importantly, we compare and contrast that HCoV from the point of view of evolution and recombination of the genome.
>>zsm_Latn<< The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, the successful host transition requirements and the implications of viral evolution in the severity of the disease were also eliminated.
>>zsm_Latn<< The corona virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of RNA viruses covering, positive induction, and single-winged.
>>zsm_Latn<< The virus has the largest genome with a size of 26 to 32 kilograms among the RNA viruses called αCoV - due to its crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
>>zsm_Latn<< Based on its structure, CoV has an unsigned genome that has similar completion.
>>zsm_Latn<< About two thirds of the genome consists of two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap. Both are translated into polyprotein replication pp1a and pp1ab.
>>zsm_Latn<< Polyproteins undergo further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
>>zsm_Latn<< The rest of the genome consists of open reading framework (ORF) for structural proteins, which include bumps or spikes (S), envelopes or envelopes (E), membranes (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
>>zsm_Latn<< A number of complementary proteins specific to certain lineages are also conditioned by various CoV lineages.
>>zsm_Latn<< Based on differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified into four genus (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among those four genus, beta-CoV genus has the most HCoV and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
>>zsm_Latn<< Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while poultry is the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< For thousands of years, CoV continues to cross species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< To date, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoV).
>>zsm_Latn<< Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the heavy acute respiratory coronary virus (SARS-CoV), the Middle Eastern respiratory corona virus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as pickles and/or diarrhea.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are very pathogenic, causing low respiratory tract infection at relatively more patients and have a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and manifestation outside pulmonary organs.
>>zsm_Latn<< The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the selesus of patients who were selesma in the mid 1960s.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since then, the more knowledge is collected through a deep study of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which both cause healing symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak occurs.
>>zsm_Latn<< The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most damaging outbreaks in today's history, which infects over 8,000 people with a rough death rate of about 10%.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a continuous epidemic in the Arab Peninsula with the spread of sporadics to various other parts of the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< The new HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), which is next called SARS-CoV-2, is a causative agent for the epidemic of crown virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3.120 people and infected more than 91,000 people to 3 March 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< The alarm is already ringing and the world has to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< The seven HCoVs all have the zoonotic origin of bats, mice, or pets.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many evidence supports the origin of evolution of all HCoVs of bats.In bat, CoVs are well adapted and are nonpatheemic, but show great genetic diversity.
>>zsm_Latn<< The COVID-19 epidemic has raised tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< HCoV background tracking gives a framework to understand natural history, driving power, and limiting factors occur between species displacement.
>>zsm_Latn<< This study can also guide or facilitate the search for reservoid, intermediate, and SARS-CoV-2 hosts, which have important implications in the prevention of future spread.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this review, we provide a general picture of the origin of zoonotics, interspecies transmissions, and HCoV pathogenesis.
>>zsm_Latn<< We specifically highlight and discuss the general topic that HCoV's parent virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but becomes pathogenic after interspecies transmission to new hosts.
>>zsm_Latn<< We also reviewed the trend of HCoV evolution that increased transmission capabilities were often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenesis.
>>zsm_Latn<< The final results of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic are also discussed in this context.
>>zsm_Latn<< CoV has been known since the late 1930s.
>>zsm_Latn<< Before HCoV-229E isolation of the first B814 strain of the innus of the infected patients of selemma, various CoVs have been isolated from various infected animals, which include turkey, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the last few dasawars, seven HCoVs have been identified.
>>zsm_Latn<< A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative clue.
>>zsm_Latn<< The HCoV-229E was first isolated from the patient's respiratory tract that had upper respiratory infections in 1966, which was further adapted to be grown in the WI-38 lung cell line.
>>zsm_Latn<< HCoV-229E infected patients showed symptoms of selemma, which included headaches, chills, diarrhea, and sore throats, accompanied by fever and coughs seen in 10~20% of cases.
>>zsm_Latn<< Next in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and sequenced series lines in the still sucking brain.
>>zsm_Latn<< The clinical image of HCoV-OC43 may seem similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomaticly indistinguishable from other respiratory tract pathogenic infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
>>zsm_Latn<< HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and tend to be most transmitted during the winter in temperate areas.
>>zsm_Latn<< Usually, these two viruses incubation times are less than a week and are followed by a period of illness for about 2 weeks.
>>zsm_Latn<< Based on a human volunteer study, a healthy person infected with HCoV-229E experienced mildelerma.
>>zsm_Latn<< Only a few patients with a weakening immune system show the infection of the lower respiratory tract.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS, also known as the αpneumonia of the atapist α is a pandemia caused by the first well documented HCoV in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
>>zsm_Latn<< The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
>>zsm_Latn<< The SARS epidemic resulted in 8.096 cases reported with 774 deaths, which were spread in many countries and continents.
>>zsm_Latn<< Despite the super regulars, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with incubation time 4 to 7 days and viral load peak seen on the 10th day of the disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< The patients infected SARS-CoV were initially suffering from myalgia, headaches, fever, diarrhea, and shivering, followed by dyspnea, coughs, and respiratory disorders as advanced symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< Limphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased creatin kinases are common lab disorders in SARS.
>>zsm_Latn<< Alveolar diffusion damage, epithel cell proliferation, and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< Next, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include gastrointestinal, liver, and kidney channels can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokin storms, which can be lethal, particularly in patients whose immunity is weak.
>>zsm_Latn<< Virus was first isolated from open lung biopsies of zero patients who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since then, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
>>zsm_Latn<< HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands by the end of 2004.
>>zsm_Latn<< The virus was originally very common in small children, elderly, and patients whose immune system suffers from respiratory disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< The description of coriza, conjunctionitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common to be found in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another independent study explains the same viral isolation of the nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spreading worldwide.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of general respiratory diseases and the peak of events occurred in early summer, spring, and winter.
>>zsm_Latn<< HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laringitis, also called groups.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been cared for unexpectedly because of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma exasperation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 are found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< The four HCoVs of this community have entirely adapted to humans and generally have a small likelihood of mutating into a very pathogenic disease.Despite that, the unusual case does indeed occur for unknown reasons, as in the case of HCoV-NL63 more virulens recently reportedly lead to underweight respiratory infections in China.
>>zsm_Latn<< Generally, when having the ability to move efficiently and continue to maintain themselves within humans, this virulent and pathogenic HCoV is also reduced.
>>zsm_Latn<< MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of 60-year-old patients who had acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although most cases of laboratory confirmation are from the Middle East, import cases with occasional secondary deployment to close contacts have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another secondary plague occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
>>zsm_Latn<< The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to the clinical manifestation of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
>>zsm_Latn<< Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which so far only occurs in MERS among HCoV-cause diseases.
>>zsm_Latn<< More than 30% of patients exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until February 14, 2020, over 2500 cases confirmed labs were reported with high case deaths, which is 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most terrifying viruses known to humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< In mid to late December 2019, a pulmonary patient cluster that was retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
>>zsm_Latn<< The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the outbreak of undersea respiratory infection is in progress and is caused by SARS-CoV-2 as Global Health Emergency as well as naming the disease COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed around the world, with a rough case death rate of 3.4%.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is worth noting, the death of the case in Hubei, China, by 4.2%, while the death of the case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a fever, cough, and suffocation of breath.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop quickly into acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology, by 82%, both group into different phylogenetic tree branches.
>>zsm_Latn<< The SARS-CoV-2 pathogonity is obviously lower, but is more infectious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< Subjects infected SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been reported and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
>>zsm_Latn<< Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows very interesting equations and differences.
>>zsm_Latn<< First, incubation times and duration of HCoV disease travel are very similar.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
>>zsm_Latn<< Second, COVID-19 severity lies between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (the HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
>>zsm_Latn<< On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture seen on Community HCoV infection, which includes an image of mild nonspecific symptoms or even without symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, a small portion of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infection even with a slightly lower ratio.
>>zsm_Latn<< Thirdly, SARS-CoV-2 transmissions also show interesting patterns characteristics, having similarities to both HCoV community and SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmission capabilities are at least as high as HCoV community.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, decreased lack of SARS-CoV-2 transmission capabilities after some pathways in humans still need to be verified, as the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lastly, just like any other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a fases sample.
>>zsm_Latn<< —Is SARS-CoV-2 transmissions play an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmissions, at least in a certain situation, it still has to be clarified by subsequent studies-
>>zsm_Latn<< It is also very important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of HCoV community.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, the SARS-CoV-2 image, which includes transmission capabilities, pathogenesis, and continuous spread in some pathways in humans, will have a profound effect on the fate of an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak end.
>>zsm_Latn<< Four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< In view of another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
>>zsm_Latn<< In other words, both HCoV and humans may be the species of an ancient HCoV pancreas.
>>zsm_Latn<< HCoV which causes severe diseases in humans and humans who have severe HCoVs have been eliminated.
>>zsm_Latn<< In order for this to happen, HCoV must replicate in humans in sufficient amounts to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations in order to counteract the limiting factor of the host.
>>zsm_Latn<< Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the more likely this virus is to adapt fully to humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< If the virus adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to halt with quarantine or other steps of control of infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< Over the years, four CoVs of the community circulated in human populations and triggered selemma in imonocompetence people.
>>zsm_Latn<< This virus does not require animal reservoirs.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans and its transmissions in humans cannot be maintained.
>>zsm_Latn<< Both must defend themselves and do breeding in zoonotic reservoirs as well as look for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, likely through one or some intermediate host and amplifiers.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 has an image similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted like HCoV community, at least now.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCoV community and is not as pathogenic SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< Still it should be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt fully to humans and circulate in humans without the host of pets or intermediates.
>>zsm_Latn<< Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of evolutionary host, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and HCoV amplifiers.
>>zsm_Latn<< Animals act as HCoV evolutionary hosts if they have close-related ancestors and share high homology at nucleotide sequence levels.
>>zsm_Latn<< Viruses usually adapt well and are nonpathogenic in this host.
>>zsm_Latn<< Likewise, the reservoric host carries HCoV continuously and over a long period of time.
>>zsm_Latn<< In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts for HCoV or parent viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, if HCoV simply enters the intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters the human, the virus has not adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
>>zsm_Latn<< This intermediate host can serve as a source of zoonotic human infection and play a role as an amplifier host by allowing viruses to temporarily replicate, then transmitting it to humans to modify the scale of human infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< HCoV can experience end-up infection if it cannot maintain its transmission in an intermediate host.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemics.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
>>zsm_Latn<< Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the SARS zero case had a history of contact with hunted animals.
>>zsm_Latn<< Further research suggests that the animal solder had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG than the general population.
>>zsm_Latn<< The moon-like Musang (SARS-CoV which is almost identical to SARS-CoV's wild dog in the living animal market is the first to be identified to carry a virus-like virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the snails in the market were killed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Such a trend, it is reported that the moon's snails from the wild or unexplored farm to the living animal market largely yield negative test results for SARS-CoV. This implies that the moon's worm may only act as an intermediate amplifier host, but not a natural resorvoir of SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< It should be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be set aside that perhaps many small mammal species also serve as an intermediate amplifier host of SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< All of these hosts seem to be the final host of SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< The search for natural animal host for SARS-CoV next reveals the close kinship CoV CoV, which is called CoV bat Rhinopus relative-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in China's horse-pal bat bat.
>>zsm_Latn<< This bat gives positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequences.
>>zsm_Latn<< This coV and other bat CoV share homology of nucleotide sequences 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< This study became a foundation for the new concept that bats are host to newly emerging human pathogens.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV) are also identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< 2 (ACE2) modifier enzymes are known to be SARS-CoV receptors.
>>zsm_Latn<< WIV1 derived from bat fases samples is shown using ACE2 bats, snails, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
>>zsm_Latn<< Interestingly, serum of convalent SARS patients can neutralize WIV1.
>>zsm_Latn<< So far, the WIV1 represents the ancestor that is closest to the SARS-CoV in the bat, with a homology sequence of nucleotides by 95%.
>>zsm_Latn<< Despite the height of homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the SARS-CoV direct parent virus and the bat is not the direct maintainor host of SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< Physogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
>>zsm_Latn<< CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoVs use the same host receptor, namely peptide peptide 4 (DP4), as a viral entry path.
>>zsm_Latn<< RNA polymerase sequences are physiologically closer to their matching in the beta-CoV bat identified from Europe and Africa.
>>zsm_Latn<< To date, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
>>zsm_Latn<< MERS-CoV and its nearest relatives CoV-HKU25 bats only share 87% homology sequence nucleotides.
>>zsm_Latn<< As such, bats may not be directly reservory host MERS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, the study in the Middle East shows that the Arab camel gave a sleopative result for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just as the Middle Eastern camel is native to some African countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans is isolated from the history story of the Arab camel.It further indicates that the camel is the actual reservorate host for MERS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is also important to note that the decay of the massive virus with symptoms that are usually light observed on the experimental camel infected with MERS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is worth noting, the camel who is infected with the virus is not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of the viral decay of the bat.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, the question is still unanswered because many confirmed MERS cases have no history of contact with the camel before the song of symptoms, likely as a result of human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with the RaTG13 bat CoV isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis bat.
>>zsm_Latn<< As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, sequences differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to establish parent relationships.
>>zsm_Latn<< In other words, bats may not be directly reservory host SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical CoVs are found later.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is possible, the inter animal host of SARS-CoV-2 is among the species of wildlife sold and killed at the Huan Sea Food Grosir Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are associated with this market, which indicates the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some of the latest studies based on metagenomic sequences show that a group of endangered small mammals, known as trends of javanica, may also carry ancestral beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< This new CoV triggering gene shares 85-92% homology sequence nucleotides with SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, the CoV is closely related to RaTG13 with a resemblance of 90% at the rate of nucleotide sequence.
>>zsm_Latn<< Both are grouped into two subline-generations of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in phylogenetic trees, one sharing receptor binding domains (RBD) which are more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with the similarity of amino acid sequences of 97.4%.
>>zsm_Latn<< What is striking, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are further different, even though the level of sequence homology the entire genome is higher.
>>zsm_Latn<< The previous study on the diseased trending also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which turned out to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< This study adopted different methods of drafting and manual curation to produce partial genome sequences consisting of about 86.3% of complete viral genomes.
>>zsm_Latn<< We cannot set aside the possibility of grinding as one of the shared animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 derived directly from the trending due to the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 marginalized.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathway in bat, incline, and other mammals must still be established.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although the highest sequence homology in RBD is found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 trendsing, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology at the level of sequencing the entire genome.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is highly speculated if it is said that the high level of similarity between the beta-CoV RBD relative-SARS-CoV-2 trending and SARS-CoV-2 is activated by a convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
>>zsm_Latn<< The match hypothesis supports recombination between beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 trendsing and RaTG13 in third wild species.
>>zsm_Latn<< As an evolutionary drive factor, recombination occurs much among beta-CoVs.
>>zsm_Latn<< Researchers are still unable to decide about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to very pathogenic HCoV, the zoonic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
>>zsm_Latn<< Philogenetic evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from the bat's CoV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 carrier viruses have been found in rodents.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is reported that a bat's CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in a three-colored North American bat shows a close kinship with HCoV-NL63.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to other bat CoVs, with the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with Camelidae thought to be also its intermediate host.
>>zsm_Latn<< To make it clear, current knowledge of the origin of known HCoV animals is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
>>zsm_Latn<< A phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of HCoV interspecies transmission in history.
>>zsm_Latn<< In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed species of cattle to infect humans, the presence of respiratory infections was recorded.
>>zsm_Latn<< The history of HCoV-229E interspecies transmission is not very clear.
>>zsm_Latn<< Alfa-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E have been found.
>>zsm_Latn<< Between the two, there is alpha-CoV alkak.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< First, humans, not arse, who may be in contact with bats in a joint ecological loop.
>>zsm_Latn<< Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with the alkawa.
>>zsm_Latn<< Second, alfa-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E exist a variety and nonpathegenics in bats, while alpha-CoV asthma causes respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lastly, the alpha-CoV alkak is not found in feral animals.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, the possibility of the alkawa getting alpha-CoV relative-HCoV-229E from humans cannot be set aside.
>>zsm_Latn<< In fact, bats are a direct source for human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another possibility, while the alfa-CoV bat acts as a muddle of the HCoV-229E gene, the Arab alphabet and camel may serve as an intermediate host that transmits the virus to humans, exactly like the MERS-CoV case.
>>zsm_Latn<< MERS-CoV is an excellent example for interspecies transmission from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< The origin of MERS-CoV evolutionary from bats is known on the early identification of viruses and is also reinforced with subsequent findings.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is clear that bats are rich species of viruses for exchange of interspecies genetic fragments and interspecies transmissions.
>>zsm_Latn<< Long age, closely organized colonies, close social interaction, and strong flying ability, all are conditions that support the bat to be an ideal 'viral preacher'.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered the Arab camel for decades.
>>zsm_Latn<< This virus has adapted to camel which has changed from intermediate host to stable and natural reservoir host.
>>zsm_Latn<< MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains relatively low mutation rate in this animal.
>>zsm_Latn<< His spatial transmission to humans occurred by chance and man remained the final host for MERS-CoV because its transmission could not continue.
>>zsm_Latn<< Unlike the role of the camel in the MERS-CoV transmission, the rotational role, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmissions is different.
>>zsm_Latn<< In particular, beta-CoV trending is very pathogenic in rounding.
>>zsm_Latn<< The edge may be the final host for the beta-CoV relative SARS-CoV-2, similar to the snail in the SARS-CoV case.
>>zsm_Latn<< In future studies, some possible SARS-CoV-2 interspecies transmissions from animals to humans should be taken into account or set aside.
>>zsm_Latn<< Firstly, bats could have been a reservory host for SARS-CoV-2 relatives virus that was almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< Humans can share ecological loops with bats through drilling or coal mining.
>>zsm_Latn<< Secondly, the trending could have been one of the intermediate amplifier hosts for the newly incoming SARS-CoV-2 related virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< Humans get viruses through breeding and consumption of hunted meat.
>>zsm_Latn<< Perhaps, many mammals, which include pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< Antibodies survey of pets and wild animals need to be conducted.
>>zsm_Latn<< Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that contact both bat and tiling.
>>zsm_Latn<< The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 animals is still taking place.
>>zsm_Latn<< Despite the various types of animal hosts, the three main factors of the virus side are also important to facilitate CoV across species barriers.
>>zsm_Latn<< First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
>>zsm_Latn<< Compared to another single-armed RNA virus, the estimate of the speed of CoV mutation can be considered -assang - to - high - with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per base, depending on the CoV adaptation phase against the new host.
>>zsm_Latn<< CoV has a correctional exoribonuclease, deletion that results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
>>zsm_Latn<< Interestingly, Remdesivir nucleotide analogs are known to suppress CoV replication through this exoribunuclease inhibitor and aRNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
>>zsm_Latn<< Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical experiments.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, the speed of the CoV mutation is about one million times higher than the rate of its host mutation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Also, the rate of mutations is often high when CoVs have not adapted to host.
>>zsm_Latn<< Compared to SARS-CoV which has high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is actually lower, signaling higher adaptation rates to humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< Likely, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts that are closely related to humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV which has adapted to the Arab camel.
>>zsm_Latn<< Theoretically, it is less likely that genetic contamination will quickly make vaccines and antivirus agents to SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
>>zsm_Latn<< Second, the large RNA genome in CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolutionary evolution, which is favorable for the emergence of new CoVs as conditions fit.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is supported by many unique open reading skeletons and protein functions that are conditioned towards the end of the 3- genome.
>>zsm_Latn<< Thirdly, CoV frequently replaces the template randomly during RNA replication through the mechanism - select-salisali.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the host that serves as a mixing container, the transition of the strand frequently occurs during the transcription of the CoV RNA.
>>zsm_Latn<< A complete and very homologous subgenomic RNA can undergo recombination to form a new CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, so is in the CoV of animals such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
>>zsm_Latn<< The virus-inang interaction in relation to transmission
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptors is another major factor that influences interspecies transmission.
>>zsm_Latn<< Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
>>zsm_Latn<< Based on computational analysis between human-CoV SARS-CoV isotopes and snails, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptations in various hosts, particularly with mutations on RBD proteins S.
>>zsm_Latn<< Generally, RBD proteins S CoV interact with cell receptors and intensively into host antibodies response targets.
>>zsm_Latn<< In SARS-CoV, RBD is 318 to 510 amino acids on S1 fragments, which bind to human ACE2 as well as its acceptor as a viral entry path.
>>zsm_Latn<< The SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to recognize various ACE2 receptors, which include bats, worms, rats, and wild dogs, thus allowing transmission of interspecies viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< In fact, only 6 amino acid residues are observed to differ between the human virus isotope and the spinal cord in RBD and 4 of which are located in receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV has a K479N and S487T mutation in its RBD, which may increase the affinity for the interaction of the fundamental protein with human ACE2 receptors.
>>zsm_Latn<< In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit S implications the affinity for protein binding S with ACE2 humans are likely to have changed.
>>zsm_Latn<< In fact, a cryo-EM study shows the affinity of human ACE2 binding and S SARS-CoV-2 proteins 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV proteins.
>>zsm_Latn<< Also important to know is whether there is another acceptor that may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission..
>>zsm_Latn<< Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with different parts on S.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidesse N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-erasociated cythic acid for HCoV-OC43.
>>zsm_Latn<< These receptors may also play a role in the success of these CoV adaptations in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal host.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to cell receptors, the final results of interspecies HCoV transmission are also regulated by the dependent factors and other host restrictions.
>>zsm_Latn<< This difference in host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arab camel, and rodent animals can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
>>zsm_Latn<< HCoV must take over the host's dependent factors and boil the host restriction factor in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this respect, these important molecular identifiers in the field of viral interactions still have to be identified and characterized.
>>zsm_Latn<< The thinning of the entire genome is not biased to see the dependent factor and restriction of SARS-CoV-2 hosts using advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
>>zsm_Latn<< The result of a new HCoV: back to the beginning of the outbreak
>>zsm_Latn<< CoV diversity gave great opportunities for the emergence of new HCoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this case, CoV bat acts as a fracture of HCoV genes.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, quick mutations and genetic recombination also move the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, the acquisition or loss of a gene of new proteins can potentially drastically modify viral phenotypes.
>>zsm_Latn<< Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans due to an isolated relative-SARS-CoV bat virus found to encode a variety of ORF8 proteins.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV with a distinctive feature of the removal of 29 nucleotides found in strain isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< This removal separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that supports the host transition.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, SARS-CoV may have a recombination history with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineage, with large amounts of recombinant regions smaller identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
>>zsm_Latn<< Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and partial nsp14.
>>zsm_Latn<< Similarly, the recombination events between the various lineages were shown to take place in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in the Arab camel in Saudi Arabia.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed on other HCoVs where HCoVs undergo recombination with the CoV of other animals in its nonstructureal genes.
>>zsm_Latn<< Also it should be noted that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes in the viral genome, likely resulting from the release of the virus from the pressure of the selection experienced, such as by the host immune system.
>>zsm_Latn<< An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 on the HCoV-229E prototype strain as a result of the removal of two nucleotides.
>>zsm_Latn<< While whole ORF4 can be observed on the bat virus and camel related to HCoV-229E, the alfa-CoV cage shows a single nucleotide side that results in a skeleton shift.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lastly, the new HCoV evolution is also activated by the selection pressure in its reservoir host.
>>zsm_Latn<< Light symptoms or without symptoms are detected as the bat is infected with CoV, which shows the adaptation between CoV and bat.
>>zsm_Latn<< It seems that bats adapt well to CoV anatomically and physiologically.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, defects in the activation of proinflammation responses on bats will decrease the pathology triggered by CoV efficiently.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the rise in the regulation of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the level of expression of the low class's main histocompatibility complex molecular expression.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of high bat metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and influence erection by exoribonucleases thus giving selection pressure for highly pathogenic straining of viruses as it enters the new host.
>>zsm_Latn<< More pathogenic strains may also develop through recombination, which results in the acquisition of a new protein or protein feature for host adaptation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two dasawars.
>>zsm_Latn<< CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir host, such as bats and camels.
>>zsm_Latn<< CoV replicates strongly without triggering strong host immune responses.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is where the secret lies the presence of carriers without symptoms and the cause of heavy cases on human infections.
>>zsm_Latn<< Heavy symptoms are mainly due to excessive immune response activation as well as cytokine storms, with increasingly severe pulmonary damage if immune responses become stronger.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, on the carrier without symptoms, immune responses have already escaped CoV replication.
>>zsm_Latn<< The same strategy for deciding the link between immune responses may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
>>zsm_Latn<< Interferon responses are especially strong on bats.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, providing type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, the activation of NLRP3 in the bat is defensive.
>>zsm_Latn<< For this reason, NLRP3's inflamosomes with MCC950 may be beneficial in handling COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general groove of the occurrence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< While the beta-CoV bats that share 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there are also CoV bats that share 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although the worms and other animals in the market were found to carry viruses that were identical to SARS-CoV, the immediate intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 was not found.
>>zsm_Latn<< Beta-CoV trending is very homologous with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which suggests that trends may play a role as one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV trending may contribute to gene fragments in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans either intentionally or unintentionally.
>>zsm_Latn<< CoV is again a center of attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
>>zsm_Latn<< CoV studies in bats and other animals have greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCoV on human transmission.
>>zsm_Latn<< Very much evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from bat and transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
>>zsm_Latn<< Given that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and worms in the wet market, it may be wet market closure and murder all of the snails in it that end the SARS epidemic effectively.
>>zsm_Latn<< For the same reason, railing should be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-CoV line trends that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, the truth and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted to humans through the trending and other mammals still have to be clarified in future research.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arab camel for a long time.
>>zsm_Latn<< It serves as an important transportation tool as well as as as a main source for meat, milk, skin, and wool products for the local community.
>>zsm_Latn<< Arab elements are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, we cannot possibly kill all camels to control MERS, as done in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach must be made to develop a vaccine for an effective camel against MERS-CoV and combined with another infection control step.
>>zsm_Latn<< Before we succeed in eliminating this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause outbreaks.
>>zsm_Latn<< Various zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
>>zsm_Latn<< In particular, the potential zoonotic coV bats are very diverse.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are many possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and experience recombination, which results in the emergence of a new CoV that is easier to transmit and/or more lethal for humans in the future.
>>zsm_Latn<< Culture feeds on wild animals in some places in China must be left to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
>>zsm_Latn<< With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparations and counter planning should be applied.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet ever since.
>>zsm_Latn<< These viruses are in its natural reservoir until there is an opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many features that support the spread of viruses, the chances of humans contact bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from wild animals.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sustainable Surveilans to mammals need to be done to better understand CoV ecology and its natural hosts, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
>>zsm_Latn<< In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is that humans must keep the distance from the ecological reservorate natural zoonotic virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some of the SARS-CoV-2 derivatives of the SARS-CoV-2 puzzles have not been found.
>>zsm_Latn<< First, if the bat transmits SARS-CoV-2's ancestry virus to the trending, conditions when bats and trends share ecological loops are important to know.
>>zsm_Latn<< Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans interact with bats must be determined.
>>zsm_Latn<< Thirdly, if there is a third mammal that plays a role as an actual intermediate host, the way the mammal interacts with other species, which include humans, bats, and trends should be clarified.
>>zsm_Latn<< Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infections and surveyians should be done.
>>zsm_Latn<< Either bat, guming, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its almost identical parent virus can be identified in its natural host in the future.
>>zsm_Latn<< Continued investigation in this field will outline the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary pathway in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< Diagnostic criteria update - the expected case ← and ← the confirmed case - COVID-19 needs to be done
>>zsm_Latn<< On February 6, 2020, our team published quick advice for diagnosis and handling of new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide was based on our experience and became a good reference to fighting the pandemic around the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experiences; therefore, diagnosis and handling strategies are also continually updated.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this letter, we answer one of the comments on our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for the αfrontal α and αcassus confirmed - based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guide to COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
>>zsm_Latn<< In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) had caused outbreaks, which are now formally called coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease and the virus was named coronaviruses of acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 11, 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed quick advice guides and the guide had been published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< The guide has been a lot of attention since published.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, it needs to be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experiences; therefore, diagnosis and handling strategies are also continually updated.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example the Diagnosis and Treatment Guide to COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions with a portion of context has been changed quite much.
>>zsm_Latn<< Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple score-giving proposal based on their clinical experience.
>>zsm_Latn<< Their work adds new evidence to our guidance as well as being valuable references to this pandemic around the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< We support their significant work results and express our appreciation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, their work results also require updates based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Guide for the latest COVID-19 (seven trials version) and the latest studies.
>>zsm_Latn<< Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the chance case requires a combination of one of the epidemiological history descriptions with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or necessary fulfillment of three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
>>zsm_Latn<< Epidemiological history: (1) the history of travel or living in the city of Wuhan and its surrounding area, or another community where the case of COVID-19 has been reported in 14 days before the singing of symptoms; (2) the history of contact with the case of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) the history of contact with patients suffering from fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and its surrounding area, or other communities of COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the singing of symptoms; (4) a contact with a confirmed case cluster (98 cases with fever and/or of symptoms occurring weeks in small offices, etc.
>>zsm_Latn<< Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) features imaging of COVID-19 infection; (3) total count of white blood cells show the count of normal lymphocytes, decreased, or decreased in the early song stage.
>>zsm_Latn<< Diagnosis should be based on the expected case with any of the pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a sequence of the entire virus genome shows high homogeneity for the new known coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or a positive change in IgG specific-SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or an increase of positive, or increased β4 fold in recovery rates above the acute rate.
>>zsm_Latn<< We can see that the real-time nucleic acid PCR tests in a sample of respiratory tract or blood were added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (January 22, 2020).
>>zsm_Latn<< Pathogenic detection in blood samples was added in the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); then, serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
>>zsm_Latn<< This modification based on the ongoing research of researchers to search for optimal nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood production, which increase the availability of various specimens, and support the inclusion of certain antibody positive results into confirmed criteria.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, there is an increasing amount of evidence that reminds us to be aware of patients with the symptoms of atherapeutic and without symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< Therefore, Zhou et al. alial chart should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as -beresics are low -
>>zsm_Latn<< The score system also needs to be verified in practice and clinical studies in the future.
>>zsm_Latn<< As a close, we hope more direct evidence will appear and ask the reader to give comments.
>>zsm_Latn<< For an categorical diagnosis - a foreseen α and αcassus confirmed - we recommend following and following the latest guidelines in each country.
>>zsm_Latn<< Our team will also update our guides periodically as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
>>zsm_Latn<< Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on that day.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is the highest death rate in one day as a result of the virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of recorded cases of infection including 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases living at home.
>>zsm_Latn<< Total 17 deaths.
>>zsm_Latn<< In an online news tactic, the director of IEDCR, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, says death covers four men and a woman.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years, and one case between 41-50 years.
>>zsm_Latn<< He also said the two victims were from Dhaka.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one who died was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti Corruption Commission, who was treated at Maistie's Kuwait Hospital.
>>zsm_Latn<< On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Minister of Road Transport and Bridge, Obaidul Quader said public transportation would be discontinued longer than originally planned, until Saturday came.
>>zsm_Latn<< This public transportation termination has begun since March 26, and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
>>zsm_Latn<< Transport of basic goods -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
>>zsm_Latn<< The first recorded COVID-19 infection incident in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people who had just returned from Italy as well as one of them.
On March 19, the three men were cured.
>>zsm_Latn<< SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds the number of one million worldwide
>>zsm_Latn<< On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 crown virus infection exceeds one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
>>zsm_Latn<< At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the crown virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< The peak occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first corona virus infection and Zambia experienced its first death associated corona virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country was one of the few countries that remained free of corona virus infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051.635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 in the Middle European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the United States (AS), there are recorded over 244 thousand cases of crown virus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
>>zsm_Latn<< The CBS News Office reports, citing Johns Hopkins University data, there are over 1,000 deaths in the US resulting from corona virus infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< Worldwide, countries announce stricter actions to inhibit the spread of disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow, extended the territory quarantine until May 1.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russian citizens would remain paid without having to go to work until the 30th of April.
>>zsm_Latn<< Portugal's Parliament made a vote to extend national emergency status for 15 days; the vote departed with 215 support votes, ten abstain votes, and one voice refused.
>>zsm_Latn<< Saudi Arabia extended the evening hours in the holy city of Mecca and Madinah all day; earlier, the night hour only occurred between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
>>zsm_Latn<< Thailand plans to apply the evening hours between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ohio governor, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home until May 1.
>>zsm_Latn<< Stores in Australia lower the cost of purchase of toilet tissue per transaction
>>zsm_Latn<< On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, the Australian Woolworth and Coles store network each dropped the toilet tissue purchase constraint to two and one pack per transaction at all stores at the national level.
>>zsm_Latn<< ALDI also applied a limit of one pack, on Monday.
>>zsm_Latn<< This restriction is announced as a message on the comb and on its network Facebook page.
>>zsm_Latn<< Buyers are reported to accumulate supplies resulting from COVID-19 fears if the community has to do independent isolation.
>>zsm_Latn<< On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet tissue for delivery to home to one pack per order.
>>zsm_Latn<< This change followed the restriction of four packages per transaction previously applied Woolworths and Coles respectively on March 4 and 5.
>>zsm_Latn<< In his media statement of March 8th, Coles reported that by imposed the restriction of the four packs, - many stores were still running out in one hour since the shipments - and called the request - have never occurred before - while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, calling it » unpredictable
>>zsm_Latn<< The sales - going up by - last week, according to one Woolworths spokesman.
>>zsm_Latn<< Costco stores in Canberra also limit the amount allowed up to two packages last week.
>>zsm_Latn<< To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered packs larger than suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotion activities available earlier.
>>zsm_Latn<< Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Peritel Association, said that the perimeter was trying to increase supplies, but local government agencies' limitations for the time of truck delivery made it difficult.
>>zsm_Latn<< It anticipates a rise in production costs, as suppliers strive to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
>>zsm_Latn<< On Tuesday, ALDI announced that as it had removed supplies early, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from the Queensland University of Technology, said the store filled supplies every night.
>>zsm_Latn<< It emphasizes that toilet tissue is a largevolume item so that the amount of supplies it is low and, if it is sold out, make lots of empty space on the shelf so that the scarcity of goods gets more and more flavored.
>>zsm_Latn<< Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there is a lot of goods on the shelf, if products such as toilet tissue and sanitation can be [bought] and there is in large numbers, panic may be minimized, Russel Zimmerman's ujar via ABC News Office.
>>zsm_Latn<< Products of recycling toilets Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday last that they were running out of supplies.
>>zsm_Latn<< Kimberly-Clark, who made Tisu Toilet Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorgent, stressed them working 24/7 to keep the supply, according to News.com.au reports.
>>zsm_Latn<< Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some property sellers offer free toilet tissue to the first auction bidder in Melbourne, as fewer auctions are held because the buyer takes a pause for the long holiday weekend.
>>zsm_Latn<< The NT News Thursday edition, a daily printed in Darwin, includes eight side pages intended to be cut and used as toilet tissue.
>>zsm_Latn<< The stores were rightly reluctant to implement the constraints, according to the ABC Australian report on March 3, they said that they were not planning to apply the purchase constraints.
>>zsm_Latn<< Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, sanitation, dry foods, handwash soap, and flour.
>>zsm_Latn<< Likewise outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon English online supermarket Ocado observed limiting the purchase of Andrew's toilet tissue to two packs containing 12 rolls.
>>zsm_Latn<< The World Health Organization (WHO) states COVID-19 as a pandemic
>>zsm_Latn<< On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated the plague of COVID-19 that was in progress - a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2–as a pandemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although the word -pandemia - refers only to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to encourage the government to act:
>>zsm_Latn<< All countries can still change the journey of this pandemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates, and mobilizes its people in response, the U.S. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreesus, director of General WHO.
>>zsm_Latn<< We are very cautious both because of the alarming rate of spread and severity as well as due to the degree of infancy of alarming action.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to Dr. Tom Frieden, the former director of the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic was - have never occurred before .
>>zsm_Latn<< He said, in a record published CNN in February, - aside from influenza, no respiratory tract virus was ever tracked from its appearance until a sustained global spread-
>>zsm_Latn<< Ghebreesus expresses a similar view, by saying - we have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus -
>>zsm_Latn<< He goes on, - and we have never seen a controlable pandemic at the same time -
>>zsm_Latn<< The new status of the pandemic followed WHO's decision in January which declared this outbreak to be a debauching crowd.
>>zsm_Latn<< The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Faucin, says about this outbreak, -it is, of course, this outbreak will worsen -
>>zsm_Latn<< Until Thursday, Associated Press reported there are at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
>>zsm_Latn<< The 2019-2020 pandemic is the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) that is ongoing and is caused by the coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
>>zsm_Latn<< The plague was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a Public Health Emergency Concerning the World on January 30, 2020, and declared as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until April 10, 2020, about 1,61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial territories, resulting in about 970,000 deaths.
>>zsm_Latn<< About 364,000 people have recovered.
>>zsm_Latn<< The case's fatality figures are estimated to be 4% in China, while worldwide range from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
>>zsm_Latn<< Common symptoms include fever, coughs, and breaths.
>>zsm_Latn<< The complications can include pneumonia and acute breathing syndrome.
>>zsm_Latn<< Time from exposure to symptom singing in general is about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
>>zsm_Latn<< There has not been any known vaccines or specific antivirus treatments.
>>zsm_Latn<< The main treatment of symptomatic and complementary therapy.The recommended preventive action includes washing hands, closing the mouth while coughing, keeping the distance from others, and monitoring and self-explanation for those suspected of infected.
>>zsm_Latn<< Authority around the world has responded by enforcing travel constraints, quarantine, night hours, workplace hazards control, and the closure of facilities.
>>zsm_Latn<< This epidemic has led to heavy global economic social disorder, delay or cancellation of cultural, political, religious, anxiety, and the extent of the scarcity of the waste supply of things multiplied by the purchase of panic.
>>zsm_Latn<< Schools and universities have closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the population of learners worldwide.
>>zsm_Latn<< The misinformation of this virus has spread online and there is an incident of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with Eastern and Southeast Asia's descendants and appearance, and people who come from areas with significant cases of viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< As a result of the reduction in travel and the closure of the heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions declined.
>>zsm_Latn<< Health authorities in Wuhan, China (ibukota province of Hubei), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and investigations were conducted in early January 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< The cases are mostly related to Huan Sea Food Grosir Market and therefore the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
>>zsm_Latn<< Viruses that caused outbreaks are called SARS-CoV-2, the virus that was newly discovered and related to the bat's coronavirus, the marginal coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was then known to fall ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no clear relation to the wet market cluster mentioned later.
>>zsm_Latn<< Among the early case clauses reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a connection to the market.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, on a 55-year old man from Hubei province, likely was the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with new cases reported decline in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time.
>>zsm_Latn<< There may be a large number of cases not reported, especially among people with milder symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< Up to February 26, relatively few cases reported among youths, with people 19 years of age below forming 2.4% of cases worldwide.The leading British scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the British population need to be infected before group immunity can be reached.
>>zsm_Latn<< The case refers to the number of people who have been tested COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positively according to the official protocol.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
>>zsm_Latn<< A study published on March 16 found that in China, up to January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that this undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of the documented cases.
>>zsm_Latn<< A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be greater than the reported case.
>>zsm_Latn<< The initial estimate of base reproduction figures (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
>>zsm_Latn<< A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was possibly 5.7.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most COVID-19 sufferers were cured.
>>zsm_Latn<< For those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since April 10, 2020, about 970,000 deaths are associated with COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< In China, up to February 5, about 80% of deaths occur in people over 60 years old and 75% have pre-existing health disorders, which cover cardiovascular and diabetes diseases. official death count of COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to people who die giving positive test results for COVID according to official protocol.
>>zsm_Latn<< The actual fatality rate as a result of COVID-19 may be much higher, given the official number likely not including the person who died without being tested, for example, at home, at the carehouse, etc.
>>zsm_Latn<< The partial data from Italy found that the amount of excess death figures during the pandemic went beyond the calculation of official COVID death with 4-5 times factors.
>>zsm_Latn<< A female spokesman for the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, ← We know [proclaimed death numbers] it is lower than the actual numbers - a statement confirmed by nonscientific reports of calculations too low in the U.S. The too low count often appears in the pancreas, as on the H1N1 pig flu epidemic of 2009. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
>>zsm_Latn<< Up to 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
>>zsm_Latn<< Up to 13 March, over forty countries and territorial regions have reported death, on every continent, except Antarctica.In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
>>zsm_Latn<< These figures vary according to regions and over time, as well as are affected by the amount of testing, quality of health care systems, management options, time since the first outbreak, and the character of the population such as age, gender, and health as a whole.The ratio of death to the case reflects the number of deaths is divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a specified interval of time.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality ratio to cases is 6.0% (97,039/1.617.204) per 10 April 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< This number varies according to the region.
>>zsm_Latn<< In China, the ratio of death to cases decreases from 17.3% (for people with a song of symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptom singing after February 1, 2020). Other measurements include case reality figures (CFR), which reflect the percentage of diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the incidence rate of infection (IFR), which reflects percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died of certain diseases.
>>zsm_Latn<< These statistics are not bound time and follow a particular population from infection to case resolution.
>>zsm_Latn<< A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
>>zsm_Latn<< Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the fatality of infection for the pandemic as a whole between 0.1% and 0.39%.
>>zsm_Latn<< The upper limit of this range of estimates is in line with the result of the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical insertion that analyzes the impact of tests on CFR estimates.
>>zsm_Latn<< WHO asserts that this pandemic can be controlled.
>>zsm_Latn<< The peak and end duration of this outbreak is unclear and may differ according to location.
>>zsm_Latn<< Boni's Maciej of Penn State University states, ‘Without control, infectious outbreaks are usually horizontal and then begin to decline as the disease runs out of the available host.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, it is almost impossible to make the current reasonable projections about when it happens »
>>zsm_Latn<< China's senior government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan contends that - this outbreak may end June - if the whole country can be bombed to follow WHO's advice on measures to stop viral spread.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 - would continue to circulate, possibly up to one or two years-
>>zsm_Latn<< According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures will be required » so vaccines are available (probably 18 months or more) )
>>zsm_Latn<< William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, ‘I feel little likely that this coronavirus is, as it is very easy to transmit, can disappear as a whole-and this disease-may-be turn into seasonal disease, which comes back every year' -
>>zsm_Latn<< The recurrent Virulence will depend on group immunity and mutation rates.
>>zsm_Latn<< COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively not specific and infected people can be without symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
>>zsm_Latn<< Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory sputum (flegma), loss of breathing power, constipation, joint pain and muscle pain, throat pain, headaches, shaking, vomiting, hemoptosis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people becomes severely ill and has difficulty breathing.
>>zsm_Latn<< The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including breathing difficulties, stressed chest or settled chest pain, sudden confusion, walking difficulties, and blueness on face and lips; medical attention is immediately recommended if these symptoms arise. Further development of disease can be severe pneumonia, acute breathing syndrome, sepsis, septitis, and death.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some infected people may be asymptomatic, that is, without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are closely contacted with the confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and checked to ensure not infected.
>>zsm_Latn<< Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
>>zsm_Latn<< The period of incubation (time between infection and symptom singing) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example uncertainty, an estimate of the number of COVID-19 sufferers who lost the sense of smell initially 30%, then decreased to 15%.
Details about how the disease spreads are still being studied.
>>zsm_Latn<< The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur primarily at close contact times and through small droplets produced when coughing, gasping, or talking; close contact is contact within a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
>>zsm_Latn<< Research found that uncovered coughs could lead to 4,5 meters (15 feet) pushed droplets ( 8.2 meters (27 feet).
>>zsm_Latn<< Some researchers estimate viruses may also be transmitted by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when speaking. Breathing drumlets can also be produced while exhaling, including while speaking, although these viruses are generally not transmitted through air.
>>zsm_Latn<< Droplets can fall in the mouth or nose of the person who is nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the heart (RJP), can make respiratory secretions turn into aerosol and then spread through air.
>>zsm_Latn<< Spreading can also occur when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches the eye, nose, and mouth.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although there are concerns that viruses can spread through fases, this risk is believed to be low.
>>zsm_Latn<< China's government narrows the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by fecal-oral.Virus most contagious within the first three days after the singing of symptoms, although spread may occur before symptoms are seen and in further stages of disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< People give positive test results up to three days before the singing of symptoms, which signal transmission may occur before significant symptoms occur.
>>zsm_Latn<< Only a small amount of asymptomatic case reports are laboratoryly confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries when an investigation into contact.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Center for Prevention and Prevention of European Disease (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. This virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
>>zsm_Latn<< In particular, it was found that viruses could be detected for up to three days on plastic (polopropilen) and rubber-proof steel 304, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positively COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although British authorities recommend hand washing after contact with animals, such as after contact with a surface that may already be touched by infected people.
>>zsm_Latn<< 2 acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
>>zsm_Latn<< All new features of SARS-CoV-2 viruses are associated with coronaviruses in nature. Outside of the human body, this virus can be destroyed if exposed to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the early SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< Virus is estimated to have a zoonotic origin.
>>zsm_Latn<< Genetic analysis reveals that the coronavirus is genetically classed with the genus Betacononavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (the B lineage) along with two bat-based grooves.
>>zsm_Latn<< This virus has 96% in the entire level of the genome with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
>>zsm_Latn<< In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a difference of one amino acid in certain parts of genome sequences between marginal viruses and human viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< To date, the comparisons of the entire genome find most of the same as 92% of genetic material between the marginal coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, are not enough to prove that the marginality is an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< The virus can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, but confirmation is eventually done through reverse transcription polymerase (rRT-PCR) chain reactions on infected or embarrassing CT imaging.
>>zsm_Latn<< A study that compares between PCR and CT in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with much of the imaging features overlap with pneumonia and other disease processes.
>>zsm_Latn<< In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended -CT should not be used for filtering or as a first line test in diagnosing COVID-19-
>>zsm_Latn<< WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were distributed first on January 17.
>>zsm_Latn<< Testing using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
>>zsm_Latn<< Testing can be done on breathing or blood samples.
>>zsm_Latn<< Results are generally available in several hours to several days.
>>zsm_Latn<< Generally, this test is performed in nasofaring conversation, but throat talk can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing a serological test that detects antibodies.
>>zsm_Latn<< As of April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved to be accurate enough to be widely approved for use.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the US, the serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by certified labs.
>>zsm_Latn<< The characteristics of radiography imaging features and concomputed tomography (CT) in a symptomatic person include the optimization of ground glass peripheral asymmetry and no pleura diffusion.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Italian Radiological Society is building an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
>>zsm_Latn<< Because overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation of PCR has limited specifies in identifying COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< A large study in China compared the results of chest CT to PCR and showed that although it is less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as a filtering tool in the area of the epidemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< An artificial intelligence-based neural network has been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
>>zsm_Latn<< The strategy of preventing the transmission of the disease involves maintaining a comprehensively good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eye, nose, or mouth before washing the hand, and wearing the tissue while coughing or combing and immediately throwing the tissue into the trash.
>>zsm_Latn<< People who may already have been infected are recommended to wear surgical masks in public places.
>>zsm_Latn<< Physical restriction measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in various regions have restricted or discourageed to stop all unisensitial trips to and from countries and areas affected by outbreaks.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, viruses have reached the level of spread of community scale in most regions of the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< This means that viruses have spread in the community, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected.A medical care provider handling people who may be infected is recommended to perform standard prevention acts, contact prevention actions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
>>zsm_Latn<< The use of location data from cell phones by the government for this purpose has triggered a privacy problem, with the release of statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for this type of surveyal restriction.
>>zsm_Latn<< Various cellular applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts working on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user distance proximity to other mobile phones.
>>zsm_Latn<< Next, the user will receive a message if they are close to a person who is positively tested for COVID-19.Bers a misunderstanding of how to prevent infection; for example, brushing the nose and muttering with an ineffective mushroom drug.
>>zsm_Latn<< There has not been a COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
>>zsm_Latn<< Washing hands is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hand is seen dirty; before eating; as well as after rubbing noses, coughs, or combs.
>>zsm_Latn<< This encouragement is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that damages its protective layer.
>>zsm_Latn<< Furthermore, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitation with alcohol content at least 60% based on volume when soap and water are not available.
>>zsm_Latn<< WHO encourages people not to touch the eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands.
>>zsm_Latn<< The surface can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (in one minute exposure is synthesized for the surface of rust-proof steel), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50%, hypoglorit sodium 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another solution, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidin gluconet, is less effective.
>>zsm_Latn<< CDC recommends that if there is an unexpected or confirmed case of COVID in a general facility, such as the office or place of child storage, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, electronic devices together such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control, and ATM machines used by sufferers, should be infected.
>>zsm_Latn<< Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with elbows that are pierced or use the tissue when coughing or combing, then quickly discard the tissue.
>>zsm_Latn<< Masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because of using masks can limit the volume and distance of the exposure droplet that is spread when speaking, breathing, and coughing.
>>zsm_Latn<< WHO has issued instructions on the time and manner of masking.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, - Eating masks can reduce people's tendency to touch the face with an unhygienic hand, which is a primary source of transmission »Masker is also recommended for wear by someone who cares for others who may suffer from this disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people who care for COVID-19 sufferers, although WHO also acknowledges that using masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some countries have already begun to encourage the use of masks to members of the community.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the US, CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of cloth. China specifically recommends the use of medical masks once used to healthy societies, especially when adjacent (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hong Kong recommends surgical masking when using public transportation or living in crowded places.
>>zsm_Latn<< Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them every day.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited its society from going out into public places without wearing masks or covering the nose and mouth.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Austrian government requires everyone entering the toilet to wear face masks.
>>zsm_Latn<< Israel asks all its citizens to wear face masks while in public places.
>>zsm_Latn<< Taiwan, which produced ten million masks per day since mid March, requires railway passengers and intercity buses wearing face masks per April.
>>zsm_Latn<< Panama requires the use of face masks whenever out of the house, as well as recommending the making of self-made face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
>>zsm_Latn<< Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
>>zsm_Latn<< Social restriction (also called physical restriction) is an act of infection control intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
>>zsm_Latn<< Social restrictions methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
>>zsm_Latn<< People can apply social restrictions methods by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping physical distance from others.
>>zsm_Latn<< Today, many governments require or undermine social restrictions in areas affected by outbreaks.
>>zsm_Latn<< The maximum number of people assembled recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced, starting from 250 people (if unknown there is a COVID-19 distribution in a region) to 50 people, and then 10 people.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people.The Netherlands and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and disturbed immune systems that had serious and higher complications were recommended CDCs to be at home only as possible in areas that had outbreaks at the community level. By March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term - social restriction - to make clear that its purpose is to reduce physical contact by keeping social relationships, either virtual or distant.
>>zsm_Latn<< The use of the term - social limitation - suggests that people should isolate themselves completely socially and do not encourage people to stay in touch with others through alternative ways. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the time of the pandemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< This recommendation includes encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and do not have viruses or viral symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< Self isolation in the home is recommended for persons diagnosed with COVID-19 and the person suspected of being infected.
>>zsm_Latn<< Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct self isolation.Many governments require or recommend private quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
>>zsm_Latn<< The most strict self-containing quarantine instruction is issued for people who include high risk groups.
>>zsm_Latn<< A person who may be exposed to COVID-19 and a person who has recently traveled to a country or territory with a wide spread of COVID-19 is recommended to perform a self-containing quarantine for 14 days since the possible time of the last exposure.
>>zsm_Latn<< The strategy in the control of the outbreak is prevention or depression, as well as mitigation.
>>zsm_Latn<< The dam was done at the early stage of the outbreak and aimed to track and isolate the infected person as well as perform other measures for the control of infection and vaccination that aim to stop the spread of disease throughout the population.
>>zsm_Latn<< When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of disease, the next attempt turns to the mitigation stage: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health and society care systems.
>>zsm_Latn<< The combination of safety and mitigation actions can be performed at the same time.
>>zsm_Latn<< Depression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pancreas by reducing the base reproductive numbers to less than 1.The passage of the management of infectious disease outbreaks is trying to lower the epidemi peak, which is known by predicting the epidemi curve.
>>zsm_Latn<< This lowers the risk of unemployment on health care and gives more time to the development of vaccines and treatments.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nonfarmation interventions to handle outbreaks include acts of individual prevention, such as handwashing, wearing face masks, and self-containing; measures at the level of society aimed at physical restriction, such as closing schools and canceling mass meeting events; society's engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in this kind of intervention; as well as measures at environmental level, such as surface cleanup. Other drastic actions aimed at preventing outbreaks are being performed in China as the severity of plague is becoming evident, such as labeling the whole city and setting up a strict ban on travel.
>>zsm_Latn<< Other countries also implement various measures aimed at limiting viral spread.
>>zsm_Latn<< South Korea introduced a local mass filtering and quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
>>zsm_Latn<< Singapore provides financial support for infected people who do their own quarantine and wear a large fine for those who fail to do so.
>>zsm_Latn<< Taiwan increases the production of face masks and penalizes medical supplies. Simulations for England and the United States indicate that mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and depression (returning the growth of the epidemic) have a major challenge.
>>zsm_Latn<< Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the peak demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
>>zsm_Latn<< Depression can be selected, but needs to be maintained as the virus still circulates in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first one achieved), because if not, the transmission will jump back quickly as the compression measures are tolerated.
>>zsm_Latn<< The long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brought an impact on social and economic.
>>zsm_Latn<< No specific antivirus drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are being made, which includes existing drug testing.
>>zsm_Latn<< Taking free flu drugs, drinking enough water, and rest can help alleviate symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< Depending on severity levels, oxygen therapy, intravena fluid, and respiratory support may be needed.
>>zsm_Latn<< The use of steroids can worsen the patient's condition.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some compounds previously approved for the treatment of another virus disease are being researched to be used in treating COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< WHO also states that some of the traditional and home-based treatments can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< WHO says that improving capacity and adapting health care for the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic step in responding to outbreaks.
>>zsm_Latn<< ECDC and European regional WHO offices have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care to divert resources at various levels, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible canceling the elective procedures, separating and isolating positive patients COVID-19, as well as improving intensive care skills by training personnel as improving the number of ventilators and beds.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are various theories about the origin of the first case (which is called zero patients).
>>zsm_Latn<< The first known new coronavirus case can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
>>zsm_Latn<< In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
>>zsm_Latn<< These cases are largely related to Huan Sea Food Grosir Market, which also sells living animals, and one theory says that viruses come from one of these kinds of animals; or, in other words, viruses have zoonotic origins. A pneumonian cluster with unknown causes is observed on December 26 and dealt with by the doctor Zhang Jixian at Hubei Province Hospital, who informs CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27.
>>zsm_Latn<< On December 30, a group of doctors at the Whanan Center Hospital told their colleagues about -coronavirus-like SARS-
>>zsm_Latn<< Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading fake rumors, and the others, Ai Fen, were reprimanded by his superior for the warnings it issued.
>>zsm_Latn<< The City Health Commission then issued a announcement to the public on December 31 and informed WHO.
>>zsm_Latn<< Quite a number of unknown cases of pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan who then triggered an investigation in early January, at the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
>>zsm_Latn<< In early and mid January 2020, viruses spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during the New Year Imlek and because Wuhan was a transportation center and the main railway transit place.
>>zsm_Latn<< On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
>>zsm_Latn<< Further official data showed that 6.174 people had experienced symptoms on 20 January 2020.Per 26 March, the United States had exceeded China and Italy with the highest confirmed cases in the world. Up to April 9, 2020, over 1,61 million cases had been reported worldwide; over 970,000 people died and over 364,000 were cured.
>>zsm_Latn<< About 200 countries and territorial territories have at least one case.
>>zsm_Latn<< Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Territory limit free movement and make border control.
>>zsm_Latn<< The national response includes measures of protection, such as quarantine (known as domestic order, sheltered order in place, or quarantine of territory) and night hours. On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are in a type of quarantine of territory in the United States, over 50 million people are quarantined regions in the Philippines, about 59 million are quarantined regions of South Africa, and 1.3 billion are quarantined regions in India.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in a type of region quarantine condition, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, namely about one third of the world's population.
>>zsm_Latn<< The first confirmed COVID-19 case can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report shows the earliest case on November 17.
>>zsm_Latn<< Zhang Jixian observed the cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 26; this observation was informed of his hospital to CDC Jianghan on December 27.
>>zsm_Latn<< Early genetic testing of the patient's sample on December 27, 2019 indicates the presence of SARS-like coronaviruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< Public announcement was released by the Whan City Health Commission on December 31.
>>zsm_Latn<< WHO was informed on the same day.
>>zsm_Latn<< When this notice was carried out, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police because α deses - spreading about the plague.
>>zsm_Latn<< The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there is no - evident evidence versus transmission from man to man.
>>zsm_Latn<< By the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by the secretary general of China's Communist Party Xi Jinping as the people's war - to defend the spread of viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< In a carantina referred to as the largest -kartina in human history - cordon satitaire or sanitary restriction was announced on January 23 to stop the trip in and out of Wuhan, and expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, which affected a total of about 57 million people.
>>zsm_Latn<< Personal vehicle use is prohibited within the city.
>>zsm_Latn<< The New Year's celebration of Imlek (January 25,) was canceled in many places.
>>zsm_Latn<< The authorities also announced the construction of the temporary hospital, the Huushenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another hospital was also built after it, the Leishenshan Hospital, to deal with additional patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to the newly built hospital, China also changed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as the convention center and stadium, into a temporary hospital. On January 26, the government arranged further steps to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including releasing health declarations for tourists and extending the summer Festival holiday.
>>zsm_Latn<< All universities and schools within the country are also closed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hong Kong and Macau regions apply several steps, particularly in regard to schools and universities.
>>zsm_Latn<< Steps to working from a distance are applied in some areas of China.
>>zsm_Latn<< Travel restrictions are imposed inside and outside Hubei.
>>zsm_Latn<< Public transport was modified and museums across China closed temporarily.
>>zsm_Latn<< Control for public movement was applied in many cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some sort of restriction outside the house.After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent - importing the virus from other countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, Beijing imposed a forced quarantine 14 days for all international tourists who entered the city.On March 23, the only case of mainland China was transmitted within the country five days earlier, in this case through a tourist who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 24, 2020, China's Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted within the country had basically been blocked and the plague had been controlled in China.

>>zsm_Latn<< This also led to a lack of self-protecting tools around the world, and WHO warned that this would endanger health.
>>zsm_Latn<< In Australia, the pancreas provides new opportunities for purchasers of daigou to sell Australian products within China.
>>zsm_Latn<< This activity resulted in the scarcity of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in North Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were spared from food shortages.
>>zsm_Latn<< Chinese and Italian measures in combating the storage and illegal trade of important products were successful so that a lack of anticipated acute food would occur in Europe and North America could be avoided.
>>zsm_Latn<< Northern Italy, with its massive agricultural production, has yet to experience a decline in meaning, but prices can increase according to industrial representation.
>>zsm_Latn<< The empty food shelf was found only temporarily, even in the town of Whanan, as Chinese government officials removed pork reserves to ensure society's nutritional possession.
>>zsm_Latn<< A similar law exists in Italy, which requires food manufacturers to store reserves for such an emergency.
>>zsm_Latn<< The decline in global economy has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was severely hit in the first two months of 2020 as a result of the measures taken by the government to withstand viral spread, and the sale of an ajkkknal retail by 20.5%.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since mainland China is a major economic center and manufacturing, viral outbreaks are considered to cause a major threat of destabilization to the global economy.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the market will remain vibrating until there is a clearer picture of the potential final outcome.
>>zsm_Latn<< In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the collapse of the epidemic on global growth could go beyond the outbreak of SARS in 2002-2004.
>>zsm_Latn<< An estimation from experts at Washington University in St. Louis stated the plague affected over $300 billion on the world supply chain, which could last up to two years.
>>zsm_Latn<< Earth's Oil Exporting Organization (OPEC) reported -kucar-cacir - after oil prices suffered a sharp decline as a result of a decrease in demand from China.

>>zsm_Latn<< Many people think economic recession may occur.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mohamed El-Erian praised the central bank emergency measures and the timely state.
>>zsm_Latn<< The central bank reacted faster than they did at the time of the 2008 monetary crisis.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to the ban on travel, the closure of public places including tourist sites, and government actions that restrict travel around the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< As a result, many airlines cancel flights because of the slightest demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
>>zsm_Latn<< The impact on the shipping line industry is at a level that has never been seen before.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Epidemies coincide with Chunyun, the main travel season related to New Year's New Imlek holiday.
>>zsm_Latn<< A number of events involving many were canceled by the central government and the area, including the annual New Year's festival of Imlek, and private companies also privately closed shops and tourist sites, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many New Year's events Imlek and tourist sites were closed to prevent mass meetings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions.
>>zsm_Latn<< In 24 of 31 provinces, municipalities, and Chinese territories, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday to February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to be reopened until the date.
>>zsm_Latn<< These regions are the product of 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hong Kong increased the prevention of infectious diseases to the highest level and announced emergency, closed the school to March, and canceled the New Year's celebration. The retail sector was impacted globally due to a reduction in working hours or temporary closure.
>>zsm_Latn<< Visit to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
>>zsm_Latn<< North American retailers and the Middle East experienced a decrease in 50-60%.
>>zsm_Latn<< This also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
>>zsm_Latn<< The international shopping center operator imposes additional measures, such as increased sanitation, the installation of thermal scanners to check the purchase temperature, and canceling of events.In estimates of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, the recessions caused by the pandemic can cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million people compared to situations without a pandemic.
>>zsm_Latn<< In January and February 2020, during the epidemi peak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most of China's 300 million rural migrant workers settled at home in the interior or trapped province of Hubei, by March 2020, over 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates, coronavirus outbreaks can cause the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rates can reach 32%. The territory of India caused tens of millions of migrant workers (who were paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. A survey from Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of households in Canada experienced some sort of job loss. Nearly 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since it was imposed on the territory quarantine in mid March 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers submitted temporary unemployment allowances and 1 million British workers submitted a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany submitted short-term work schemes were subsidized by the government for its employees, called Kurzarbeit.
>>zsm_Latn<< The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
>>zsm_Latn<< Around the world, the art sector and cultural heritage are impacted greatly by the pancreas, which influences the operation of the organization as well as individuals, both the employed and the independent.
>>zsm_Latn<< The art and culture sector organizations seek to uphold their missions (which are often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, keep employee and community safety, and support artists if possible.
>>zsm_Latn<< By March 2020, around the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, show places, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with exhibits, events, and shows being canceled or postponed.
>>zsm_Latn<< In response, intensive efforts are exerted to provide alternative services through digital platforms.The adverse effects of this new and highly developed disease are the cancellation of religious services, large sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences, as well as foam lamps.
>>zsm_Latn<< The film industry also suffered interference.The Vatican announced that the festival of the Holy Week in Rome, which fell in the last week of the pre-Christian repentance season, was canceled.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many bishops encourage the Christian elderly to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services through radio, online broadcasts or television, while others offer drive-in or program worship.
>>zsm_Latn<< With the closing of the church and chapel by the Roman Catholic Bishops as well as clearing the Saint Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and limited public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and curtains.
>>zsm_Latn<< Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by outbreaks and places of worship was then closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to holy places in Mekah and Madinah.
>>zsm_Latn<< This pandemic has caused the most significant interference to the world sports calendar since World War II.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most major sports events were cancelled or delayed, including the EUFA Champions League 2019-2020, the Premier League 2019-2020, UEFA Euro 2020, NBA season 2019-2020, and NHL season 2019-2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< The plague messed up the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be destined for again until after 2020, but would not be more than summer 2021 - The rest of the world, casinos and places of the game were closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
>>zsm_Latn<< This has caused many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites report significant new enrollment increases.The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delaying or canceling concert tours.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many large theaters such as Broadway also delayed all shows.
>>zsm_Latn<< The artist explores various ways to continue producing and sharing works via the internet as an alternative to traditional direct shows, such as online live broadcast concerts or make -festival - web-based for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their work.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many Internet memes are distributed online with many people turning to humor and distracting in the midst of uncertainty.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as against people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< The incident of fear, suspicion, and hostility is observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia-Pacific regions.
>>zsm_Latn<< A report from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) records the sentiment of racists expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese deserve to receive the virus or accept the thing they claim as a uniform reward.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some countries in Africa also experience an increase in anti-Tikkok sentiment.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many of Wuhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination because of their area's origin.
>>zsm_Latn<< There has been support for Chinese people, both online and offline, and for people in infected areas of the virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< Bringing the development of outbreaks to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to have serious outbreaks of COVID-19, could also be targets of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries include Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to prohibit Chinese people from entering their country in an attempt to stop disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan became a trend on Twitter.
>>zsm_Latn<< Chinese as well as other Asians in Great Britain and the United States reported increased rate of racist abuse and attack.
>>zsm_Latn<< US President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus as the αVirus of China - a term that critics consider racist and anti-Tikko.
>>zsm_Latn<< The protesters in Ukraine attacked buses that brought Ukrainians and displaced foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
>>zsm_Latn<< Students from East India, who are bordered with China, and learning in large Indian cities are reported to have had coronavirus-related abuses.
>>zsm_Latn<< President of the Bharatiya Janata state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh states that China has destroyed nature and -that's why God retaliated against them -
>>zsm_Latn<< The statement was then challenged by the Chinese consulate at Kolkata, by calling it -kiliru - In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Tiongo people spreading because of the pandemia, with foreigners described as the α foreign spice α and targeted for the α-boiling α.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many newspapers that use paid bindings have deleted it for part or all of their coronavirus coverage.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many scientific publishers make a plague-related scientific paper available with open access.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some scientists choose to share the results quickly on a preprint server, such as bioRxiv.
>>zsm_Latn<< A new infectious disease - A new pathogen infection occurs, often new in the range of outbreaks or its infectious methods

>>zsm_Latn<< Laboratory testing for coronary respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods that detect the presence of viruses and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< The presence of viruses in the sample is confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
>>zsm_Latn<< This testing is specific and is designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 viral RNAs.
>>zsm_Latn<< This testing is used to confirm new or still active infections.
>>zsm_Latn<< Antibodies detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population surveys.
>>zsm_Latn<< Antibodies test shows the number of people already intelligible, including the person whose symptoms are too light to be reported or that without symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< An accurate number of diseases and group immunity levels in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
>>zsm_Latn<< Because testing is limited, until March 2020, no country has any reliable data about viral prevalence in its population.
>>zsm_Latn<< Up to March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there are major variations in the amount of testing that the countries have performed.
>>zsm_Latn<< This variation may also significantly influence reported case fatality figures, which are likely to be counted too high in some countries.
>>zsm_Latn<< Using a real-time transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on breathing samples obtained with various methods, including nasofaring or sputum samples.
>>zsm_Latn<< Generally, the results are available in several hours to two days.
>>zsm_Latn<< RT-PCR tests performed on throat talk can only be relied upon in the first week of the disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< Later on, the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
>>zsm_Latn<< Alternatively, for infected people tested in the second week, sample material can be taken from deep breath ducts by using an steam catheter or material removed through a cough (sputum) can be used.
>>zsm_Latn<< One early PCR test was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
>>zsm_Latn<< UK also developed testing on January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed PCR-CoV-2-based SARS detection tools (PowerChek Coronavirus) that were clinically related on January 28, 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< This device is looking for the gene -E - which has all of the coronary betas, and RdRp genes specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Product Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tools. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes Diagnostic Panel RT-PCR Real-Time Koronavirus 2019 (2019-CoV) to the public health laboratory via International Rea Resource.
>>zsm_Latn<< One of the three genetic tests in the old version test tools provides convincing results due to reagent errors, and the amount of testing at CDC in Atlanta is limited; this results in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< Testing using two components is deemed unreliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only after that state lab and local labs were allowed to perform testing.
>>zsm_Latn<< This test was approved by the U.S. Drug and Food Management Agency based on Emergency Use Authority. The U.S. commercial lab began testing in early March 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< Per 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19-based RT-PCR testing on national scale.
>>zsm_Latn<< Likewise, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationally on March 9, 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< No quantity limits are announced; collection and processing of specimens must be done according to CDC requirements.
>>zsm_Latn<< In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and VECTOR Biotechnology.
>>zsm_Latn<< On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveyans in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that could be done in 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine could do about 4.128 testing within 24 hours.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the authorization of emergency use (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; the previous FDA had issued the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for testing that took about 45 minutes.
>>zsm_Latn<< The FDA has approved testing that uses an amplification technology of isothermal nucleic acids that are not PCRs.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since it does not require a series of temperature replacement cycles, this method can give positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses monoclonal antibodies that specifically binds to the new nucleopasid (protein N) coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15 to 20 minutes such as rapid influenza tests.
>>zsm_Latn<< A library review published in March 2020 concluded that αphoto thorax has a small diagnostic value at an early stage, as opposed to the findings of CT [computedomography] may already exist before the singing of symptoms ]
>>zsm_Latn<< The typical feature on CT includes the multilateral ground-glass optimization with the distribution of peripheral, asymmetry, and posterior.
>>zsm_Latn<< Subpleura domination, crazy paving, and consolidation form as the disease progresses.
>>zsm_Latn<< In Wuhan, a study that compares PCR to CT at the current stage of the pandemic shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many features of overlapping imaging with pneumonia and other disease processes.
>>zsm_Latn<< In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended -CT should not be used for filtering or as a first line test in diagnosis of COVID-19-On March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for initial filtering.
>>zsm_Latn<< Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
>>zsm_Latn<< It can be used to detect infection in individuals since about 7 days after the singing of symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveys. Examinations can be performed in central lab (CLT) or with point-of-care testing (PoCT).
>>zsm_Latn<< An automated system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this examination, but its availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
>>zsm_Latn<< For CLT, generally used one peripheral blood specimen, although a series of specimens can be used to follow immune responses.
>>zsm_Latn<< For PoCT, generally used one peripheral blood specimen obtained through skin stabilization.
>>zsm_Latn<< Unlike PCR methods, extraction measures were not required before examination.On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provided notice to the agency as needed and therefore could now distribute their antibody tests.
>>zsm_Latn<< On April 7, 2020, only one test had been approved by the FDA based on the authorization of emergency use.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Etopope Diagnostics got European approval for their test tools that could detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
>>zsm_Latn<< The testing capacity is up to several hundred samples in several hours, so it is much faster than conventional PCR examination of virus RNA.
>>zsm_Latn<< Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after infection singing.In early April, Britain found that none of the antibodies test tools it bought were good enough to use.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hong Kong compiled a scheme so that the expected patients could stay at home, αdepartement of emergency will give the patient a specimen tube, - they spit it into it, send it back, and get the test results a while later. The British NHS announced that the NHS is pioneering the emergency case testing scheme at home so that it eliminates the risk of patients transmitting others if they come to the hospital or have to infect an ambulance if used. In the program testing for the planned case of COVID-19, a professional health force will take a sample using appropriate prevention action.
>>zsm_Latn<< The program testing center has helped South Korea perform the fastest and widest tests compared to any country. On March 2, the National Association of Statistics Health Insurance Physicians Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in road care order and 10.700 tests had been performed in the previous week.
>>zsm_Latn<< Costs are borne by health insurance if tests are requested by the doctor.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to president Robert Koch Institute, Germany had a total capacity of 160,000 trials per week.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 19, the program test was offered in several large cities.
>>zsm_Latn<< As of March 26, 2020, the number of tests performed in Germany is unknown because only positive results are reported.
>>zsm_Latn<< A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples had been tested until and included weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) positive tests for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion Hospital and Rambam developed and tested methods to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only further testing if combined samples were found positive. Wuh, emergency detection labs of about 2,000 square meters called \"Huo-Yan\" (Mandarin language: »Mata, or in Indonesian, open language of February 520) can be processed by more than one day.
>>zsm_Latn<< With its construction being supervised by the founder of BGI Wang Jian and it takes 5 days, modeling shows that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and associated costs for carantina handling could double if this testing capacity did not exist.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Wuhan lab was soon followed by the Huo-Yan lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
>>zsm_Latn<< Per 4 March 2020, its total daily capacity of 50,000 trials per day.The multix design of open source released by Origami Assays can test as much as 1.222 patient samples for COVID-19 by using only 93 checks. This balanced design can be run in small labs without the need of robotic fluid handling.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until March, insufficient shortage and number of reagents had been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, Great Britain, and the United States.
>>zsm_Latn<< Because of that, a number of researchers were trying to explore the sample preparation protocol involving sample heating at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the Arab Emirate Union reportedly performed more coronavirus testing per capita of the population compared to any country, and was ready to increase the testing scale to reach most of the population.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is accomplished through a combination of program testing and mass outcome lab purchases of Groups 42 and BGI (based on emergency detection lab -Huo-Yan - in China).
>>zsm_Latn<< Built in 14 days, this lab was able to perform tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and was the first lab to have this scale outside of China.
>>zsm_Latn<< Various testing recipes targeting various parts of coronavirus genetic profiles were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
>>zsm_Latn<< The World Health Organization adopted German recipes for the production of test tools sent to low-income countries without resources to develop themselves.
>>zsm_Latn<< The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; a protocol developed by the U.S. Disease Control Center was not available until January 28 so as to slow testing available in the US. At the beginning of the plague, China and the United States were troubled with the reliability of test tools; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test tools to meet requests and recommendations of testing health experts.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, experts say that the wide availability of testing in South Korea helps to reduce the spread of new coronaviruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< The testing capacity, mostly in private sector labs, was built in several years by the South Korean government.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow down the increase in the COVID-19 pandemic. A high demand for testing due to the wide spread of viruses caused hundreds of thousands of testing waiting for operations in the U.S. private labs, and the supply of dialogue tools as well as chemical reagents to be stressful.
>>zsm_Latn<< In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems on their test tools.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the United States, the test tool developed by the CDC is αcacat; the government then removed bureaucratic obstacles that prevented testing by private.The Spanish bought a test tool from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
>>zsm_Latn<< The company explains that incorrect results may be the result of failure in collecting samples or using test tools correctly.
>>zsm_Latn<< Spaniards said that they would attract equipment that produced incorrect results, and replace it with other test tools provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic of China gave incorrect results.Slovaa bought 1.2 million test tools from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
>>zsm_Latn<< Prime Minister Matovič suggested that this test tool be removed to the Danube river. Ateş Kara of Turkish Health Kementrian said the Turkish-bought test tool from China had - a high level of error - and they didn't use it - the UK bought 3.5 million test tools from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test tool could not be used.
>>zsm_Latn<< Testing, followed by a positive tested quarantine of people and tracking people who contact a positive person SARS-CoV-2, gives a positive outcome.
>>zsm_Latn<< Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the first death location as a result of COVID-19 in Italy, performed two rounds of testing on a whole population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
>>zsm_Latn<< About half of the positive tested people have no symptoms, and all cases found are quarantined.
>>zsm_Latn<< With the restrictions of traveling to this community, new infections are completely eliminated.
>>zsm_Latn<< With aggressive contact tracking, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pancreas in Singapore develops much slower than other developed countries though without extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail companies.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many events were canceled, and Singapore advised residents to stay home on March 28, but schools were reopened on time after vacation on March 23.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some other countries also handle pandemics with aggressive contact tracking, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive territory quarantine, such as Iceland and South Korea.
>>zsm_Latn<< A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower case fatality number, perhaps because these countries were more capable of detecting people with mild symptoms or without symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity, and national labs with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference labs for confirmation testing.
>>zsm_Latn<< Of the 16 reference labs, 7 exist in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the following chart, the column - The positive results of the testing - are influenced by the country's testing policy.
>>zsm_Latn<< A country that only tests the persons treated in the hospital will have % positive results higher than the country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors the same.
>>zsm_Latn<< Washing hands, also called by hand hygiene, is an act of cleaning one's hand aimed at eliminating dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
>>zsm_Latn<< Washing hands with soap consistently on -saturately - particular all day long prevents the spread of many diseases, e.g. diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
>>zsm_Latn<< People can also be contagious of respiratory diseases, such as influenza or selemma, if they do not wash hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucosa membranes).
>>zsm_Latn<< Five critical moments throughout the day it is very important to wash hands with soap are: before and after a great drain, after cleaning a child's butt or changing a diaper, before feeding a child, before eating as well as before and after preparing food or cooking raw meat, fish, or poultry.
>>zsm_Latn<< If water and soap are not present, hands can be cleaned with ashes.The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
>>zsm_Latn<< Before, when, and after preparing food.
>>zsm_Latn<< Before and after caring for the sick.
>>zsm_Latn<< After replacing a diaper or cleaning a child who has just used a toilet.
>>zsm_Latn<< After cleaning the nose, coughing, or combing.
>>zsm_Latn<< After touching animals, animal food, or animal dung.
>>zsm_Latn<< Medical hand hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
>>zsm_Latn<< Washing hands before giving medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clear hands from pathogens (bacteri, virus, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
>>zsm_Latn<< Washing hands has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, corona virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing causing infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
>>zsm_Latn<< as well as reducing infant morbidity figures at home childbirth.
>>zsm_Latn<< The study conducted in 2013 showed that increased handwashing practices can slightly increase the high growth of the toddlers.
>>zsm_Latn<< In developing countries, the child's Mortality figures resulting from respiratory and diarrhea diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
>>zsm_Latn<< This simple act can reduce the mortality rate as a result of the disease to almost 50%.
>>zsm_Latn<< The intervention that encourages handwashing can reduce the diare case to about a third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
>>zsm_Latn<< 48% of diare cases reduction can be associated with handwashing with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ISPA), as conscious low behaviours performed at home, school, and society around the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< Pneumonia, which is the primary ISPA, is the cause of the number one child's death; this disease causes death of about 1.8 million children per year.
>>zsm_Latn<< Diare and pneumonia cause death of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to UNICEF, to wash hands with soap before eating and after using toilets into embedded habits can save more lives instead of any vaccine or medical act, as well as reduce the death of diarrhea resulting to almost half and death from acute respiratory infections to a quarter.
>>zsm_Latn<< Washing hands is usually combined along with other sanitation actions as part of a water program, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).
>>zsm_Latn<< Washing also protects oneself from the competition transmitted through direct physical contact.
>>zsm_Latn<< The small side effects of hand washing are hand washing that is often done can cause skin damage as a result of skin drying.
>>zsm_Latn<< A study conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that hand washing excessively could lead to the conditions of the skin bite and cyclical, known as hand exim or hand dermatitis, which especially occurred among health officials.
>>zsm_Latn<< Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD).
>>zsm_Latn<< There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important in order to reduce the transmission of the disease by fecal-oral, that is: before and after using the toilet (the small water, urination), after cleaning the child's butt (changing the diaper), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another important time to apply properly handwashing techniques in order to prevent disease transmission is before and after treating the wound; after washing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal dung or handling animals; and after touching the garbage.
>>zsm_Latn<< In many countries, handwashing rates with soap are still low.
>>zsm_Latn<< A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38,7% of households practiced hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate by 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle by 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate by 23 percent. Now it was available some behavioral change methodology to improve adoption of handwashing habits with soap at critical times. Washing hands grouping for learners at a time that had been determined is one option in developing countries to familiarize hands in child behavior.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Basic Health Care Program applied by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of the appropriate scaled action to support the child's health and education.
>>zsm_Latn<< Giving a worm drug twice a year, coupled with washing hands every day with soap and brushing teeth every day with fluoride, is the essence of this national program.
>>zsm_Latn<< The program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
>>zsm_Latn<< The purification of microorganisms from the skin is strengthened by the addition of soap or detergents to water.
>>zsm_Latn<< The main work of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier to solution and increase the solvent power.
>>zsm_Latn<< Water alone is an inefficient skin cleaner due to fat and protein, which is an organic waste component, not easily soluble in water.
>>zsm_Latn<< In such a sense, the cleansing of fat and protein is aided by sufficient flow of water.
>>zsm_Latn<< Solid soap, due to its reusable properties, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
>>zsm_Latn<< A small number of studies researching the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap conclude that transfers are unlikely because bacteria are scattered with foam.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nevertheless, the CDC remains to state - the liquid soap that it spends from the container without hand touched is preferred -
>>zsm_Latn<< Antibacterial soap is greatly encouraged to a health conscious society.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until now, there is no evidence that the recommended use of antiseptics or disinfectants is better for antibiotics resistant organisms in nature.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as the triclosan, which has a broad list of resistant-powered organisms strains.
>>zsm_Latn<< So even if a resistant strain is not targeted by antibacterial soap, it may not be as effective as it is marketed.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to surfants and skin-protecting substances, advanced formulations can contain acid (acetic acid, ascorbate acid, lactate acid) as a pH organizer, benzoate acids as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioners (the crocodile, vitamin, humanol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of the University's Public Health Faculty shows that ordinary soap is as effective as a consumer-level antibacterial soap that contains a trick in preventing disease and cleaning out of the hands.
>>zsm_Latn<< The warm water comfortable to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
>>zsm_Latn<< Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
>>zsm_Latn<< The warm soapy water is more effective compared to the cold water soapy in removing natural oil that retains dirt and bacteria.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, turning back with the belief of many, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
>>zsm_Latn<< Handing or hand antiseptics are non-water-based hygiene agents.
>>zsm_Latn<< By the end of the 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents were non-water-based alcohol suckers (also called alcohol-based brushers, antiseptic hands rubbing, or hand simplification) began to be known.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most of these cleaner agents based on isopropil alcohol or ethanol that are formulated along with thickening materials such as Carbomer (polyceric acid polymers) into gels or together humps like glycerin into liquids or foams in order to be easily used and to reduce the effect of drying from alcohol.
>>zsm_Latn<< The addition of hydrogen peroxide encer increases more antimicrobial activity. Hand-containing which contains at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
>>zsm_Latn<< Alcohol contamination kills bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (containing HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungus.
>>zsm_Latn<< Alcohol-contaminations that contain 70% of alcohol kill 99.97% (log reduction of 3.5, similar to the reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands of 30 seconds after wear and 99.99% to 99.99% (log reduction of 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands of 1 minute after wear. Handing is most effective against bacteria and is less effective against some viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< Alcohol-based hand utilization is almost entirely ineffective against the norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics of hands or alcohol in sufficient quantities should be used to wet or cover two hands thoroughly.
>>zsm_Latn<< The front and back two hands as well as in the cells and the ends of all the fingers are rubbed about 30 seconds to liquid, foam, or dry gel.
>>zsm_Latn<< The fingertip should also be washed well by rubbing it on two palms.The U.S. Center for Control and Disease Prevention is more recommended handwashing instead of scratching hands, especially when the hand is seen dirty.
>>zsm_Latn<< Increasing the use of sanitation agents due to the ease of use and rapid murder activity against microorganisms; however, the utilization agent should not be used in place of proper handwash, except soap and water are not available.
>>zsm_Latn<< The use of alcohol-based hand simplification can often cause dry skin, except if it is amonien and/or skin damper is added to the formula.
>>zsm_Latn<< The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other ammoien to the formula.
>>zsm_Latn<< In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand evaporation that contains amolien causes irritation and skin drought much lower than soap and antimicrobial detergents.
>>zsm_Latn<< Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or aditive substance in alcohol rubbing hands rarely occurs.
>>zsm_Latn<< The lower tendency causes contact dermatitis to interfere with being the attraction of this product compared to washing hands with water and soap.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although effective, non-water agents do not clean hands from organic material, but only infect it.
>>zsm_Latn<< For this reason, handwashers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still in hand.
>>zsm_Latn<< The efficacy of alcohol-free hand utilization depends greatly on its materials and formulations, and according to history, this product significantly works worse than alcohols and alcoholics.
>>zsm_Latn<< Recently, formulations that use benzalconium chloride have proven to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after wear, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy is proven to decrease after repeated use, perhaps due to progressive side effects reactions.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many in low-income communities are unable to buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
>>zsm_Latn<< Dust or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
>>zsm_Latn<< One of the concerns is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ashes may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
>>zsm_Latn<< Like soap, ashes are also desinkant agents because, if contact with water, ashes will form alkaline solution.
>>zsm_Latn<< WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
>>zsm_Latn<< Proper hand washing techniques based on the recommendations of the U.S. Center for Disease Control for disease transmission prevention include the following steps:
>>zsm_Latn<< Wash hands with warm or cold running water.
>>zsm_Latn<< Water flows are recommended because the kept bass may be contaminated, whereas the water temperature seems to have no effect.
>>zsm_Latn<< Put your hand by rubbing it with a lot of soap, including the back of the hand, in the finger cells, and under the nails.
>>zsm_Latn<< The soap lifts germs from the skin, and the study shows that people tend to wash hands more carefully while using soap than while using water alone.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rub for at least 20 seconds.
>>zsm_Latn<< Rubbering creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubs longer removing more germs.
>>zsm_Latn<< The season thoroughly under the water flows.
>>zsm_Latn<< Spilling inside the basskom can make the hand contaminated back.
>>zsm_Latn<< Dry with a dry lap or let it dry in the air.
>>zsm_Latn<< Wet and damp hands are easier to recontaminate.The frequent areas are thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers, and under nails.
>>zsm_Latn<< The artificial nail and the peeling nail paint can store microorganisms.
>>zsm_Latn<< Adequate lotion is often recommended to keep hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
>>zsm_Latn<< A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate handwashing while tap water and/or soap is not available, for example, draining water from a jergen or bottle suspended and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries.In situations when water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-safe solutions, such as α-tap--and other low-cost options.
>>zsm_Latn<< Tappy taps are simple technologies that use water bottles hung with ropes, levers operated by the feet to pour a little water into the hands, and a single soap.
>>zsm_Latn<< Effective hand milling is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in the public toilet.
>>zsm_Latn<< The more research shows that paper laps are much cleaner than electric hand drys found in many toilets.
>>zsm_Latn<< In 2008, a study was conducted by Westminster University, London, and sponsored by the European paper lap industry Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of paper lap hygiene, warm air-hand dryer, and more modern jet air-hand dryers.
>>zsm_Latn<< After washing and drying hands with warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria found to increase by an average of 194% in finger books and 254% in palms.
>>zsm_Latn<< Drying with jet airpower causes the rise in total number of bacteria average 42% in finger books and 15% in palms.
>>zsm_Latn<< After washing and drying hands with paper laps, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in fingerbooks and 77% on palm.The scientist also performed testing to determine cross-contamination potential on other toilet users and toilet environments as a result of every type of drying method.
>>zsm_Latn<< jet air filtering, which secretes air from units at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/hour; 400 mph), is able to blow microorganism from hand and unit and is potentially infecting other toilet users and toilet environment up to 2 meters.
>>zsm_Latn<< The use of warm air-hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dry.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lap paper shows no significant spread of microorganisms.In 2005, in studies conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
>>zsm_Latn<< After hand drying, the following number of bacteria changes are observed:
>>zsm_Latn<< There are many hand dry manufacturing, and hand dryers have been compared to drying by using paper laps.
>>zsm_Latn<< Washing hands by using hand-sustaining tissue is an alternative during the journey if there is no soap and water.
>>zsm_Latn<< Alcohol-based hand sanitation must contain at least 60% alcohol.
>>zsm_Latn<< Medical handwashing was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash hands if they forget.
>>zsm_Latn<< One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of the device.
>>zsm_Latn<< Medical handwashing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, by using soap and water in large amounts or gels to cover and rub each part of the hand.
>>zsm_Latn<< The hands should be rubbed at each other with the fingers coated with each other.
>>zsm_Latn<< If there is dirt under the nails, a fur brush can be used to remove it.
>>zsm_Latn<< Since germs can survive in the water that is in the hand, hands need to be thoroughly rinsed and dried with a clean lap.
>>zsm_Latn<< Once dry, paper laps are used to turn off water taps (and open exits if necessary).
>>zsm_Latn<< This act avoids hand recontamination from the surface.
>>zsm_Latn<< The goal of washing hands in the health care order is to eliminate pathogen's microorganism -kumman- and avoid its infectiouss.
>>zsm_Latn<< The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching the patient so as to transmit microorganisms.
>>zsm_Latn<< One study showed that proper handwashing and other simple procedures could lower the level of catheter-related blood flow infection to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing handwashing standards and hand rubs in the health care sector.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hand hygiene concept can also be seen on its website for public comments.
>>zsm_Latn<< A relevant review is conducted by Whitby et al.
>>zsm_Latn<< Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of compliance to regulations is required.
>>zsm_Latn<< The World Health Organization has -Lima Time - to wash hands:
after exposure to blood/water of the body
>>zsm_Latn<< Before the ascetic task, and
>>zsm_Latn<< after patient care.The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (sapunsa·o medicine  or αantimicroba - serves to kill handwashing materials.
>>zsm_Latn<< The killing function may be desired before performing surgery or in situations when an antibiotic resistant organism is very common. To 'boiled' hands before surgical surgery, it takes a tap that can be turned on and turned off without touching, a chlorhexidine washer or yodium, a sterile lap to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub as well as other sterile instruments to clean the nails.
>>zsm_Latn<< All jewelry must be released.
>>zsm_Latn<< This procedure requires washing hands and lower arms up to elbows, usually 25–6 minutes.
>>zsm_Latn<< An old swimming time (10 minutes) is not required.
>>zsm_Latn<< When draining, the water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
>>zsm_Latn<< After finished washing hands, hands dried with sterile cloth and surgical cloaks worn.
>>zsm_Latn<< To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use hand simplification before and after handling the sick.
>>zsm_Latn<< For the control of staffilococus infection in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands came from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefits gained very little while the hand cleaning frequency was increased above 35%.
>>zsm_Latn<< Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the transmission of infection disease to food than washing with antibacterial soap.The comparison between rubbing hands with alcohol-based solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap with median time each 30 seconds shows that alcohol-based hand rubers reduce bacterial contamination 26% more than antibacterial fertilizers.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based brushers to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and spora Clostridium difficile from hand.Invention to increase hand hygiene in health care arrangements can involve education for staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based handpickers, and written reminders as well as oral to staff.
>>zsm_Latn<< More research is required to know the most effective interventions in various health care arrangements.
>>zsm_Latn<< In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a well-sustained method of cost efficient to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, a lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in residents' homes, schools, and workplaces make targets to achieve universal handwashing behavior a challenge.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing taps near personal toilets or common toilets are rarely available, though available options to make cheap handwashing places.
>>zsm_Latn<< In any case, low levels of handwashing can also occur due to habits that have been embedded and not due to lack of soap or water.
>>zsm_Latn<< The urge and encouragement to wash hands with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and produce long-term population behavior changes.
>>zsm_Latn<< In order to walk effectively, surveillance and evaluation are required.
>>zsm_Latn<< A systematic review of 70 studies found that the community-based approach was effective in improving handwashing in the LMIC, while the social marketing campaign was less effective. One example of handwashing in the school was . UNICEF's Three Starhings that encouraged the school to take simple and cheap steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
>>zsm_Latn<< When the minimum standard is reached, schools can move from one star to the end of three stars.
>>zsm_Latn<< Building handwashing can be part of the handwashing campaign performed in order to reduce the child's illness and death.
>>zsm_Latn<< World Handwashing Day is another example of an increased awareness campaign trying to achieve the goal of behavioral change.Ability of the crown virus's 2019-2020, UNICEF encourages the wear of emoji wash hands.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some studies research the effectiveness of the overall cost of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the prevention of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the age size lost as a result of illness.
>>zsm_Latn<< One review showed that encouraging handwashing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than water intervention and other sanitation.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in a vulnerable state, such as the mother who gave birth or an injured soldier in the hospital, first known in the mid-19th century by two hand-cleaning colporteurs: Hungarian Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, - founder of modern-care in England.
>>zsm_Latn<< At the time, many people still believed that infection was caused by a foul smell called bad miasma or air.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the 1980s, outbreaks transmitted through food and infection associated with health care made the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention more actively encouraged hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< The outbreak of pork flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 increased awareness in many countries the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from the infectious disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< For example, the poster -technic washes the right hand - hung next to the wash sink in the public toilet as well as in the toilet of the office building and airport in Germany.
>>zsm_Latn<< The expression - washing the hand from - something means expressing a person's reluctance to take responsibility for something or to engage in something.
>>zsm_Latn<< The expression comes from the Bible in Matthew's book when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to baptize Jesus Christ, but has become a widely used expression in the British community.
>>zsm_Latn<< In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands constantly to clear the finder's stain; an act that shows her guilt for the crime she does and because she has persuaded her husband to do so.
>>zsm_Latn<< Also it has been known that, after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash hands more often and tend to appreciate more hand washing equipment.
>>zsm_Latn<< Furthermore, the person who is left to wash his hands after the reflection has a smaller durability involved in the act of compensation which - cleanses — such as being volunteer.
>>zsm_Latn<< Religion ordered hand washing for the purposes of cleanliness and symbolism.The symbolic washing of hands, which used water, but without soap to wash hands, was a part of the ritual washing of hands in many religions, including Bahá'í Trust, Hindus, vigilantes and netilats of yadayim in Jews, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also ordered the washing of hands for cleanliness, especially after certain actions.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hinduism, Jews, and Islam required hand washing after using toilets.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam required hand washing before and after eating.
>>zsm_Latn<< Work hazard control for COVID-19
>>zsm_Latn<< The workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of safety methodology and work health for the control of hazards using the prevention of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
>>zsm_Latn<< Proper risk control in the workplace depends on the work location and job tasks, which are based on exposure source risk assessment, the severity of disease in the community, and the risk factors of each worker who may be prone to artular COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to the U.S. Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk work has minimal job contact with the public and other colleagues; for this work, encouraged measures of prevention of basic infections, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if illness, breathing ethics, and performing cleaning as well as routine environmental infections.
>>zsm_Latn<< Work at risk of exposure is involving work that requires close contact or frequent with people unknown or suspected of suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to transmission in the ongoing society or international travel.
>>zsm_Latn<< This group includes workers who have contact with common people such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and high volume retail order.
>>zsm_Latn<< Risk control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high efficiency air filtering, protection against heating, and providing self-protection tools when meeting with COVID-19 sufferers.
>>zsm_Latn<< OSHA assumes health power and a corpse exposed to the known or suspected person suffering from COVID-19 risk of high exposure, which increases to risk exposure very high if workers perform aerosol producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, people known or suspected of COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< The appropriate risk control for these workers includes engineering control, such as negative pressure ventilation space, and self-protecting tools that suit job tasks.
>>zsm_Latn<< COVID-19 outbreaks can have some impact on the workplace.
>>zsm_Latn<< Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to care for others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
>>zsm_Latn<< The trade pattern can change, either in terms of the type of goods requested or how to obtain these items (such as shopping outside of busy hours, through delivery, or lantature).
>>zsm_Latn<< Finally, shipments of goods from a highly affected geographic region of COVID-19 can be disrupted.The readiness and plan for the prevention of infection diseases can be used to guide protection actions.
>>zsm_Latn<< The plan considers the level of risk associated with various workplaces and job tasks, includes exposure sources, risk factors arising from home and community order, as well as the risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
>>zsm_Latn<< The plan also outlines the control required to address the risk and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of plague.
>>zsm_Latn<< The preparedness and plan of the solution of infectious disease may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
>>zsm_Latn<< The purpose of plague prevention includes reducing transmission among staff, protecting people who are at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
>>zsm_Latn<< The severity of the disease in the community where the business is influencing the counterattack taken.
>>zsm_Latn<< The hierarchical control of danger is a framework used extensively in safety and work health to group the control of danger based on its effectiveness.
>>zsm_Latn<< When the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and finally self-protecting tools.
>>zsm_Latn<< Technical control covers isolating employees from work related dangers without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to apply.
>>zsm_Latn<< Administrative control is a change in policy or work procedures that require workers' or employers' actions.
>>zsm_Latn<< Self-protecting tools (APD) are considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative control, but can help prevent partial exposure.
>>zsm_Latn<< All types of APDs must be selected based on dangers in workers, properly installed as they occur (e.g., respirators), worn consistently and properly, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed to avoid contamination.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to the U.S. Department of Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk work has minimal job contact with the public and other colleagues.
>>zsm_Latn<< Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include often thoroughly washing hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, breathing ethics includes covering cough and combing, providing tissue and waste containers, preparing work from distance or work shifts with gradual arrival/reveal delays, if necessary, informing workers not to use tools and other people's equipment, and doing routine cleaning and environmental infections.
>>zsm_Latn<< A quick identification and isolation of potentially transmitted individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
>>zsm_Latn<< The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have acute respiratory symptoms should stay at home until they are free from fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using a fever drop or other symptom-reforming medication, and so that the health leave policy is flexible so that it allows employees to stay at home to take care of sick family members, and that employees know this policy.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to OSHA, the risk of exposure is involving work that requires close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with an unknown or suspected person suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around business locations, or because someone new made international trips to the location with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
>>zsm_Latn<< This group includes workers who have contact with the general public as in school, the working environment with high population density, and high volume retail order. Engineering management for this group and high risk groups includes installing high efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as hot-sellow plastics, and installing drive-thru or linture windows for customer services. Administrative management for this group and high risk groups includes encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-to-to-faced air contact with virtual communication, making work-time/assessistant delaysing trips, halting wireless locations, developing emergency communication plans for workers, including education and high risking diseases, operating personnel, operating personnel, operating personnel, and operating with regular equipment and using a community service service service service service service service, and using a regular service service service service service service service service service service service service service service and using a regular and using a driver and using a service service service service service service service service service service service service service service service provider and using a regular and using a service service provider and using a service service service service service provider and using a regular and using a service provider and using a service provider.
>>zsm_Latn<< Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
>>zsm_Latn<< If a person falls sick on an airplane, proper control to protect the workers and other passengers includes separating the sick person from others by 6 feet, pointing one cabin crew to take care of the sick person, and offering face masks for the sick person or asking him to close the mouth and nose with a tissue when cough or combing.
>>zsm_Latn<< You cabins should wear medical gloves once when caring for sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surface and may be other self-protective tools if a sick passenger suffers from fever, constant cough, or breathing difficulties.
>>zsm_Latn<< The gloves and other items of clothing should be disposed of in a life-threatening bag, and the contaminated surface should be cleaned and infected after.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ideally, medical follow is done in the isolated person's cabin.Despite the spread in the community, for school and child-keeping facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean up or infect if the infected person has ever been in the school building.
>>zsm_Latn<< If there is transmission in society at a minimum to medium level, social restrictions strategies can be applied, which include: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, gradual arrival time and return, restricting nonisencial visitors, and using separate health offices locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< If there is high transmission in local society, in addition to social restrictions strategies, extending school closures can be considered. For law enforcement officers doing daily routine activities, direct health risks are considered low by CDC.
>>zsm_Latn<< The law enforcement officer who must make contact with the confirmed or anticipated person COVID-19 is recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-protecting tools.
>>zsm_Latn<< If close contact occurs during the arrest, workers must clear and infect belts and task equipment before being reused by using sprays or household cleanups and following standard operating procedures to control and remove former APDs as well as to control and wash dirty clothes.
>>zsm_Latn<< OSHA assumes certain health and remains are in the risk category of high or very high exposure.
>>zsm_Latn<< High exposure risk work includes providing health care, support, laboratory, and medical transport power exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< This work becomes at risk of exposure very high if the worker performs aerosol producing procedures on, or takes or handles specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< The aerosol producing procedure includes intubation, cough induction procedures, bronkoscopes, some procedures and dental examinations, or the taking of invasive specimens.
>>zsm_Latn<< House work risks high exposure includes workers involved in preparing known or suspected people's body of COVID-19 cases at the time of death; this work becomes at risk of exposure very high if the worker performs Otopsi. Additional engineering control for this risk group includes isolation space for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol producing procedures are performed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care arrangements and corpses.
>>zsm_Latn<< The specimen must be dealt with with measures of prevention Level of Safety Biology 3.
>>zsm_Latn<< The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to be separated into different waiting spaces based on if they are suspected of COVID-19 cases. In addition to other APDs, the OSHA recommends respirator for people working within 6 feet away from known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, and people who perform aerosol-skilling procedures.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the United States, N95 filter face covering approved NOSH or better should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes conformity tests, training, and medical examinations.
>>zsm_Latn<< Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and increase the comfort of workers. WHO does not recommend an entirely covered garment or coverall because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
>>zsm_Latn<< WHO only recommends a surgical mask for the screening officer at the entry point.
>>zsm_Latn<< For people who take respiratory specimens, care for, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or face shield, cloaks, and gloves.
>>zsm_Latn<< If the aerosol producing procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with a N95 respirator or FFP2.
>>zsm_Latn<< Given that the supply of APD is insufficient throughout the world, WHO recommends minimizing the needs of APD through long distance medical services, physical restriction such as viewing windows, with only people involved in direct care may enter the room containing COVID-19 patients, using only APD necessary for certain tasks, continuing to use the same respirator without releasing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and monitoring the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

>>zsm_Latn<< SUBJEK: [Covid-19] Reduce the burden and prepare for the future
>>zsm_Latn<< TANGAL/WOMAN: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
>>zsm_Latn<< LISTENTION: CC0: No protected rights
We found ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
>>zsm_Latn<< COVID-19 is a thing that makes it clear that global human relationships and the responsibilities we have with each other.
>>zsm_Latn<< We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and development of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
>>zsm_Latn<< The friendship and care that we have witnessed among all colleagues via email, calls, and chats is the tremendous validation of the existence of humans, which we are quite lucky, to work with them.
>>zsm_Latn<< I am grateful and proud to be able to refer to you both as fellow workers.
>>zsm_Latn<< Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
>>zsm_Latn<< They remind me of how useful it is for today's world to be able to access Wikipedia and how strong this is a symbol for this important resource to remain available online for everyone.
>>zsm_Latn<< Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site stays running, helps pay our partner, or helps keep our community safe.
>>zsm_Latn<< The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially today.
>>zsm_Latn<< This is a moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
>>zsm_Latn<< Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
>>zsm_Latn<< Adapting to our work and schedule
>>zsm_Latn<< As mentioned earlier, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
>>zsm_Latn<< In that conversation, we consider the thing we think is a proper response to the challenges we face and the best way to maintain the survival of the organization during this time.
>>zsm_Latn<< We desperately want to eliminate pressure and support our mission for the long term.
>>zsm_Latn<< If you need to reduce the work schedule, it's okay.
>>zsm_Latn<< For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
>>zsm_Latn<< Our daily work expectancy is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, to further notice.
>>zsm_Latn<< We don't set holidays, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission requires you.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, the world cannot be predicted today, and whether you need to care for loved ones, shopping for basic needs, or going to doctors, your well-being is our priority.
We don't monitor your work time.
>>zsm_Latn<< If you are sick, don't work.
>>zsm_Latn<< This should not be said, but we say it.
>>zsm_Latn<< Pain or PTO is not required, enough to know your manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure the main work areas can be completed.
>>zsm_Latn<< (If you are diagnosed positively with COVID-19, hope to know Bryan inside T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets proper attention from management).
>>zsm_Latn<< The colleagues whose wages are clock-based will be paid full.
>>zsm_Latn<< We have said it, and said it again, to respect our commitment to the contractor's colleagues and clock-based staff.
>>zsm_Latn<< Everyone will be paid based on their work hours when it is normal.
>>zsm_Latn<< This includes if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we support you.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many people use work as a means of conveying stress to the world around us.
>>zsm_Latn<< The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
>>zsm_Latn<< Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
>>zsm_Latn<< Our request is that you communicate with your manager so we know things to be anticipated and can take appropriate action.
>>zsm_Latn<< Certain jobs are considered essential.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are some jobs that must keep going.
>>zsm_Latn<< SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, as well as Funding teams, among other things, do important work that may require additional support.
>>zsm_Latn<< We will start the process with all departments to assess our current goals and divert our focus to support the essentials for our mission.
>>zsm_Latn<< There is much to be done for all of us, we will only focus fully on the most essential projects.
>>zsm_Latn<< slowing down the present will be nothing for the future.
>>zsm_Latn<< We don't plan to - work overtime after being left - after this pandemic is passed.
>>zsm_Latn<< You will not be expected to work overtime to meet the unrealistic deadlines of the present.
>>zsm_Latn<< We realized that the situation changed and would attempt to establish a new target and a new timeline if necessary.
>>zsm_Latn<< What about APP (Year Planning)?
>>zsm_Latn<< To adjust to the new reality and expectations of daily work hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the Annual Plan 2020-2021.
>>zsm_Latn<< We mean to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to make a budget so employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and care of loved ones while accommodate those who need or want to work with fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
>>zsm_Latn<< This timeline extension greatly reduces the current workload and planning pressures throughout the organization.
>>zsm_Latn<< We will deliver our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegates and teams on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Thank the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Status, display, and office cleanup
>>zsm_Latn<< Last week, we were told that one of our colleagues based on SF may have been exposed to COVID-19 virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, out of deep concern, we employed antivirus cleaner crews to infect all surfaces in San Francisco's office.
>>zsm_Latn<< They use antivirus fluid equivalent hospitals to infect any surface, lobby, and all elevators that access our floor.
>>zsm_Latn<< The building implements its own safety installation protocol by using products that support the owner's safety.
>>zsm_Latn<< We feel happy that the office will be ready to be worn when we decide to return.
>>zsm_Latn<< Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has distributed COVID-19 protocols to us and all staff members based in DC.
>>zsm_Latn<< Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a full distance work order, in line with a guide shared with San Francisco.
>>zsm_Latn<< As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we are also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
>>zsm_Latn<< This discussion is still going on, but may be delayed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some of our colleagues worked from a long distance for the first time.
>>zsm_Latn<< Our longtime colleagues have long worked long distance realizing that it may need adjustment and they want to advise you:
>>zsm_Latn<< Limit the duration of the meeting for the longest an hour or two.
>>zsm_Latn<< If longer sessions are needed, consider how to divide them into several days.
>>zsm_Latn<< Define clearly, make agendas, and send out earlier publications.
>>zsm_Latn<< Make videos as default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
>>zsm_Latn<< Show the leader to facilitate any meeting, one to monitor the chat for the question and note the list of speakers, and one to help make a close note (or do a collaborative record making).
>>zsm_Latn<< Send an email to technical support if you need a convenient headset.
>>zsm_Latn<< Use your welfare compensation to buy small food.
>>zsm_Latn<< Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about shared work
>>zsm_Latn<< The SDM Operation Team is looking for webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support increased work distributed throughout the Foundation.
>>zsm_Latn<< This recent week we asked all community grant fund recipients to cancel Wikimedia funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO declared the pandemic to be over.
>>zsm_Latn<< We tell them that we understand our requests for cancellation and other restrictions can make them impossible to complete approved grant activities and that no one will be improved because it must delay or modify the target.
>>zsm_Latn<< This coming week we will follow up with additional guidelines on Wikimania and other regional andmatic communities conferences.
>>zsm_Latn<< In general, the sentiment of the entire global community seems to be the grief as a result of this disorder, but at the same time relieved of the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
>>zsm_Latn<< Forward, CRT is trying to prepare pages on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
>>zsm_Latn<< Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
>>zsm_Latn<< We will send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
>>zsm_Latn<< We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect with each other.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
>>zsm_Latn<< Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential information related to COVID-19 at Office Wiki.
>>zsm_Latn<< CRT will continue to update this page and ensure all the information is in one place.
>>zsm_Latn<< We also try to keep regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
>>zsm_Latn<< If you have questions about travel, events, major workflows, or difficulties regarding coverage, or other things that may require help, do not hesitate to inform and work with CRT.
>>zsm_Latn<< We are here to help provide support and be a link as needed.
>>zsm_Latn<< If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Juda, Director of the International Global SDM Operation.
>>zsm_Latn<< None of these changes are seen as neglect of our work and obligation.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the other hand, this change is a recognition that, at present, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in a way that we have never done before.
>>zsm_Latn<< These changes are the measures that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the necessary support of our movement, and give the world the service they trust.
>>zsm_Latn<< The work we've planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
>>zsm_Latn<< For now, this is the time to support each other and create room for important work that will come within a few weeks and perhaps a few months to come.
>>zsm_Latn<< We need you all to create it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so you can work best when needed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
>>zsm_Latn<< Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
>>zsm_Latn<< b'Enzim angiotensant 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface of the cell (the cell's clot) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
>>zsm_Latn<< ACE2 has an activity opposite to an angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it the target of a promising drug to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a point of entry into the cell for some coronavirus.
>>zsm_Latn<< ACE2 versions of humans are often referred to as hACE2.
>>zsm_Latn<< 2 conversion enzymes are metaloenzymes containing zinc located on the surface of endotel cells and other cells.
>>zsm_Latn<< The ACE2 protein has the M2 terminal-N peptide domain and the amino acid transporter domain renal collectrin terminal-C.
>>zsm_Latn<< ACE2 is a single-type passing membrane protein, with an enzymeatic active domain exposed to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
>>zsm_Latn<< The ACE2 extraselle domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and is eventually secreted into the urine.
>>zsm_Latn<< ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane primarily of type II lung alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial endothel cells and veins, and arterial plain muscle cells in most organs.
>>zsm_Latn<< ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
>>zsm_Latn<< The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
>>zsm_Latn<< ACE breaks angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
>>zsm_Latn<< Finally, ACE2 cuts the amino acid fenilalin terminal carboxylic from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-He-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis it into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
>>zsm_Latn<< ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides include [des-Arg9] -bradicin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
>>zsm_Latn<< ACE2 also regulates the traffic of the membrane transporter of neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as a primary entry point into the cell for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
>>zsm_Latn<< More specifically, the binding of the S1 protein on spikes or bumps of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the ACE2 enzymeatic domain on the cell surface results in endocytosis and viral translocation and enzymes into the endosomes located within the cell.
>>zsm_Latn<< The process of entering the virus also requires priming the S protein by a core protease of the host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy.This fact makes people hypothesized that the decrease in ACE2 levels in the cell may help fight infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing ACE inhibitor therapy and standard ARB.
>>zsm_Latn<< A systematic and metaanalysis review, which was published on July 11, 2012, found that â the use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34% decline in the risk of pneumonia compared to control-
>>zsm_Latn<< Furthermore, the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients who have a higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke sufferers and heart failure.
>>zsm_Latn<< The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, though the results are less powerful than the overall risk of pneumonia ?
>>zsm_Latn<< ACE2 human recombinant (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury, and seems to increase hemodynamics of the lungs and oxygen accuracy in the pig's baby with acute breathing syndrome induced by the lipophiliscarides.
>>zsm_Latn<< RhACE2 half time in humans about 10 hours with a 30 minute working song other than the length of the effects (duction) 24 hours.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising cure for patients with intolerance to the inhibitors of the mother-angiotensin system (inhibitor RAS) or on disease with angiotensn II in blood circulation increased.Inthus rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for acute acute respiratory syndrome treatment.
>>zsm_Latn<< b' Application of COVID-19 is a mobile software application designed to help track contact to withstand coronary pandemia 2019-2020, namely the process of identifying people - contact - which may have made contact with infected people.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many applications are developed or proposed, which have official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some frameworks for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
>>zsm_Latn<< Privacy issues are questioned, especially related to systems based on tracking the geographical location of application users.
>>zsm_Latn<< Alternatives that don't overly infiltrate privacy include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other phones.
>>zsm_Latn<< On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support that Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and iOS operating system.
>>zsm_Latn<< In China, the Chinese government, along with Alawa, has spread applications that allow citizens to check if they have been contacted with COVID-19 sufferers.
>>zsm_Latn<< This application is used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is used.
>>zsm_Latn<< This application was developed by the local TI community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched -StopKorona! - a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health care authorities.
>>zsm_Latn<< This application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until April 14, 2020, the application was still waiting for Google Play Store approval and Apple App Store.
>>zsm_Latn<< On April 12, the government stated that contact tracking applications were in an extended stage of development and would be available to be disseminated within a few weeks. Similar applications were planned in Ireland and in France -StopCovid.
>>zsm_Latn<< Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore applications and BlueTrace protocols. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow; this application is designed to ensure they are not leaving home.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur on an application-based system, which includes false positives and possible lack of effectiveness if the data taken applications are limited to a small part of the population only.
>>zsm_Latn<< In order to address concerns about the spread of the application -coronavirus - which is misleading or dangerous, Apple sets limits on the type of organization that can add coronary-related applications to the App Store, namely restricting only to the organization-resmi - or that has a good reputation.
>>zsm_Latn<< Google and Amazon apply similar restrictions.
>>zsm_Latn<< Supporters voice their concern about the implications of mass surveys using coronavirus applications, particularly regarding whether the surveyal infrastructure made to deal with coronavirus pandemics will be halted after the threat passes.
>>zsm_Latn<< Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued statements calling for constraints on these kinds of surveyians.
>>zsm_Latn<< This organization states eight conditions on government projects:
>>zsm_Latn<< Surveys should be - be legal, necessary, and proportional;
>>zsm_Latn<< The expansion of monitoring and survival should have a sunset clause;
>>zsm_Latn<< The use of data must be restricted for COVID-19 purposes;
>>zsm_Latn<< Data security and anonymity must be protected and proven protected based on evidence;
>>zsm_Latn<< Digital surveys should avoid increasing in severity of discrimination and marginalization;
>>zsm_Latn<< Each division of data with a third party must be defined in laws;
>>zsm_Latn<< There must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
>>zsm_Latn<< Participatory means all - my relevant interest-people are needed, which includes community health experts and the nominal group. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issues a check list.
>>zsm_Latn<< The proposed Google/Apple plan meant to address the ongoing survival problems by removing tracking mechanisms from the device's operating system after it was no longer necessary.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some countries use tracking network-based locations, and not applications, thus eliminating the need to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
>>zsm_Latn<< In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
>>zsm_Latn<< Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant privacy problems.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use the central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
>>zsm_Latn<< In South Korea, application-based systems are used to conduct contact tracking.
>>zsm_Latn<< In exchange for using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes cellular device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications through text messages to potentially infected people.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available to the general public, the thing that is allowed with a wide change in information privacy laws after guessing it MERS in the country.
>>zsm_Latn<< This information is available to the general public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using a centralized system as well as a system that protects privacy.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until April 6, 2020, the detail has not been released.
>>zsm_Latn<< Contact tracking that protects privacy is an already established concept, with a large number of research literature starting from at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert group working on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a neutralized and decentralized approach, and not a single protocol. Decentralized Protocol includes a Tracking of Decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called Contact Event Number, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocol and Mechanisms for Cell Contact Tracking (PACT), etc.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this protocol, identified personal data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use techniques that protect privacy while collecting and using location or network intersections to track the spread of COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is based on research from the white sheet -Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic — released in March 2020. Another similar goal is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was originally founded in MIT Media Lab.
>>zsm_Latn<< SafeTrace uses safe hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and officers without sacrificing the privacy of the data.
>>zsm_Latn<< On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was established by groups that had basically the same approach and was a heavily overlapping protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which was a major aspect of achieving broad acceptance.
>>zsm_Latn<< On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its government's official application into open source.
>>zsm_Latn<< On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced initiatives for contact tracking, which they claim would protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
>>zsm_Latn<< They also frame the core technology specification used in the system.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to be launched in three stages:
>>zsm_Latn<< The launch of tools to allow the government to make official applications tracking the coronavirus that protects privacy
>>zsm_Latn<< The integration of these functions directly into Google's iOS and Android and Apple plan to address the problem of data acquisition and ongoing surveys by initially distributing the system through the update of the operating system, then deleting it the same way after the threat passes.
>>zsm_Latn<< b'Reposition of drugs (also referred to as giving new goals, new profiles, or new tasks on medication or therapy transitions) is the use of drugs that have been approved for new treatment purposes, namely for different diseases or medical conditions with the initial purpose of drug development.
>>zsm_Latn<< This pathway is a scientific research pathway that is currently being conducted to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
>>zsm_Latn<< Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and covalent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be drug targets, each protein has several ligand binding sites.
>>zsm_Latn<< An analysis of the ligand binding sites can be the basis of an effective antivirus drug development project against COVID-19 proteins.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are lan-like proteases,RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hussein A A, et al researched several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed the resemblance of its framework to drugs that had been approved and had the highest involvement in speeding up the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potent drugs in its clinical studies to be recommended in clinical study design.
>>zsm_Latn<< Chlorokuin is an antimalaria drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 18, WHO announced that the related chlorokuin and hydrochloricine were two of the four drugs that would be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical test.
>>zsm_Latn<< New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the trials of chlorokuin and hydrochloricine in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxiclorokuin sulphate and phosphate chlorokuin based on the Authorization of Emergency Use (EUA).
>>zsm_Latn<< This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and diorization based on the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are being cared for, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
>>zsm_Latn<< The CDC says that â the use, dose, or duration of hydroxiclorokuin for profilacciosis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 - infection has not been established.
>>zsm_Latn<< The doctor said they used the drug when » no other choice )
>>zsm_Latn<< A Turkish research team in Istanbul was conducting a small study of the use of chlorokuin combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
>>zsm_Latn<< Large studies are underway at Duke University and University of Oxford.
>>zsm_Latn<< Langone Medical School is performing a security trial and efficacy of the use of hydrocyclocrocuin preventives.
>>zsm_Latn<< Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipiravivivivivir proved - clearly effective -
>>zsm_Latn<< Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were negatively tested in median 4 days, whereas the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not accept the drug.
>>zsm_Latn<< In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the number of patients were given favipiravivivir and half more received maniphenavir.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminds the public that evidence exists to support the drug is not too much and too early.
>>zsm_Latn<< On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for supplies and use the military to send the drug to the university hospital, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made a bid to Trump's government on the purchase of the drug, this drug may be less effective in the case of severe disease with the virus that has multlicated.
>>zsm_Latn<< This drug may not be safe if used by pregnant mothers or people trying to contain.
>>zsm_Latn<< A study of lopinavir/ritinavir (Kaletra), which is a combination of lopinavir antiviruses and diinavir, concludes that - there is no surviving benefits )
>>zsm_Latn<< This drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding proteases.
>>zsm_Latn<< A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find compounds that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 proteases.There is criticism in the scientific community regarding the direction of resources to reposition drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
>>zsm_Latn<< Include lopinavir/ritonavir in international Solidarity trials.
>>zsm_Latn<< Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had antivirus activity in vitro against some filo-, pneumo-, paramikso-, and coronavirus.
>>zsm_Latn<< One problem with antivirus treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe diseases and transmissions.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some early pretest studies suggest remedeivir may have high genetic barriers to resistance.There are several clinical trials that are in progress, including two clinical trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital, namely one for people with moderate diseases and another for people with severe illness.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are three clinical trials going on for vitamin C intravena for people who are inpatient and severe COVID-19 disease, namely two controlled placebos (Tiokok, Canada) and one without control (Italia).
>>zsm_Latn<< The State of New York started a test for an azitromising antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) Japan is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, corticosteroid inhalation for asthma, for treatment of new coronavirus infection patients who are presymptomatic.
>>zsm_Latn<< For a form of angiotensant conversion enzyme 2, Phase II trials are in progress with 200 patients will be recruited from severe cases treated in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to know the effectiveness of treatment.
>>zsm_Latn<< Researchers of the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently researching the role of colkisin in reducing inflammatory and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and suffered mild symptoms so there was no need for inap treatment.
>>zsm_Latn<< A woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding or does not use an effective method of contraception is not qualified.

>>zsm_Latn<< b'Vaksin COVID-19 is a hypothesic vaccine to the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
>>zsm_Latn<< Although there has not been a vaccine that completes the clinical test, there are many efforts being made to develop the vaccine.
>>zsm_Latn<< In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of this disease, would not be available within less than 18 months.
>>zsm_Latn<< Five vaccine candidates were in the security study of Phase I in April.
>>zsm_Latn<< COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
>>zsm_Latn<< The great plague spread around the world in 2020, which resulted in large investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
>>zsm_Latn<< Many organizations use the genomes published to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< The CEPI initiative gives a statement in April that the thing to note in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, spread on the required scale, as well as global access.
>>zsm_Latn<< In April, CEPI Indians reported that 10 different technology platforms were being in research and development during the early 2020 to make an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< The main platform target advanced to Phase I security studies, includes:
>>zsm_Latn<< nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Fase I developers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
>>zsm_Latn<< Viruse vector (Fase I expander and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
>>zsm_Latn<< As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others are announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being designed).
>>zsm_Latn<< Phase I-II tests perform initial security tests and immunogenesis, usually conducted randomly, controlled placebo, and in some locations, while determining a more precise effective dose.
>>zsm_Latn<< Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including control groups, and test the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects on optimal doses.
>>zsm_Latn<< Of the 79 active vaccine candidates were developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of which had not yet been in human evaluation (still in the study -practicinal .

>>zsm_Latn<< At the beginning of that town, The Guardian reported that U.S. President, Donald Trump, had offered the -'a large amount of money' for exclusive access to Covid-19's vaccine to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical companies Pfizer announced partnerships with the German company, BioNTech, to together develop mRNA-based vaccines.
>>zsm_Latn<< Currently, mRNA-based vaccine candidates, BNT162, are in clinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 17, 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they would get the results of clinical testing in April 2020 and the vaccine candidates who were in the final stage could start to be tested in humans in the fall.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 19, 2020 in France, the Epidemi Business Innovation Coalition Coalition Coalition (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and Pittsburgh University, with a total investment of CEPI in the development of COVID-19 vaccine reaching US$29 million.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another CEPI investment partner for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates on animals.

>>zsm_Latn<< The vaccine candidate was developed in 14 days after receiving sequences from China.
>>zsm_Latn<< At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funds as large as C$275 million for 96 medical challenges research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago initiatives and Saskatchewan University.
>>zsm_Latn<< At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced funds as large as C$192 million specifically to develop COVID-19 vaccines, with plans to establish -bank vaccines - nationals containing some new vaccines that can be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
>>zsm_Latn<< On April 2, 2020, the researchers at Pittsburgh University Medical School reported PittCoVacc testing, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate, on mice; they stated that \"MNA giving vaccine subunit S1 SARS-CoV-2 raises responses of antigen-specific antibodies that are patented [on mice] which began to be seen 2 weeks after immunization -
>>zsm_Latn<< On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the Waterloo University Pharmaceutical Faculty announced the design of DNA-based vaccine candidates as potential nasal sprays.
>>zsm_Latn<< Using bacteria, DNA is designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless-like particles, which can stimulate immune systems to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities collected resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called nonspecific effects.
>>zsm_Latn<< That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease it prevented.
>>zsm_Latn<< Further tracking tests in Australia are trying to follow 4.170 health officers.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are possible vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
>>zsm_Latn<< Early research to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, shows the need for protective measures to achieve biological safety level 3 in handling living viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
>>zsm_Latn<< Vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested on nonhuman animal models.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until 2020, there was no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that proved safe and effective in humans.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to the research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world.In addition, a proven vaccine for MERS has not yet existed.
>>zsm_Latn<< When MERS becomes prevalent, an existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infections.
>>zsm_Latn<< In March 2020, there was one MERS (mixed by DNA) vaccine that completed a phase I clinical test in humans, and three other vaccines were in the process, all of which were virus-vectored vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MIRS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vector-MVA (MVA-MERS).
>>zsm_Latn<< Social media posts conspiring conspiracy theories claiming viruses behind COVID-19 have been known before and that vaccines have been available.
>>zsm_Latn<< Patents cited by various social media posts refer to the existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus grooves, such as the coronavirus SARS.
>>zsm_Latn<< b' Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
>>zsm_Latn<< Common symptoms include fever, coughs, and breaths.
>>zsm_Latn<< Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of sense of smell, and stomach pain.
>>zsm_Latn<< Time from exposure to symptom singing in general is about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and fail compound organs.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until April 17, 2020, over 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial territories, resulting in over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered, this virus is mainly spread through human contact when close contact occurs, often through sparks or small droplets produced through coughs, gasps, or while speaking.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although produced while exhaling, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious to a long distance.
>>zsm_Latn<< A person can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
>>zsm_Latn<< On the surface, the virus can last up to 72 hours.
>>zsm_Latn<< The virus is extremely contagious for the first three days after the singing of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and after the next stage of the disease. The standard diagnosis method is with the reaction of real-time transcriptional polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) on nasofaring conversation.
>>zsm_Latn<< The use of masks is encouraged for the person who is supposed to be infected with the virus and the person who takes care of it.
>>zsm_Latn<< Recommendations on the use of masks by the general public differ; part of the authority recommends not to use masks, partly recommend its use, and others require its use.
>>zsm_Latn<< Currently, there is no vaccine or antivirus treatment specific to COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
>>zsm_Latn<< A person infected with a virus can be without symptoms or experience symptoms such as flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and a burst of breath.
>>zsm_Latn<< Emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, pain or suffocating in a continuous chest, confusion, difficulty in waking up, and face or lips of boredom; medical handling is immediately recommended if these symptoms appear.
>>zsm_Latn<< Upper breathing symptoms, such as breathing, dehydration, or throat disease, can be found, but are less frequent.
>>zsm_Latn<< Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in a variety of percentages.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some cases in China were originally only with a clinical picture of chest packed and palpable.
>>zsm_Latn<< In some people, disease can develop into pneumonia, the failure of compound organs, and death.
>>zsm_Latn<< This time is called incubation time.
>>zsm_Latn<< Incubation times for COVID-19 are usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who stutter will have symptoms in 11.5 days of infection. Report shows that not everyone who is infected has symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< This role of carriers without symptoms in transmission is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is unknown and are being studied, with the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Center (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all cases confirmed remain without symptoms during hospital treatment.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Chinese National Health Commission began to include the case without symptoms in its daily case on April 1; from 166 infections that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of testing.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sputum and saliva can carry viral loads on a large scale.
>>zsm_Latn<< Talking out loud releases more sparks or droplets than normal speaking.
>>zsm_Latn<< A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can cause the droplets to be pushed up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
>>zsm_Latn<< Although this virus is usually not transmitted through air, the United States National Science Academy shows that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air collectors placed in a hallway outside the room of people produce a positive sample for viral RNA.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some medical procedures, such as intubation and resuscitation of the heart (RJP), can convert respiratory secretions into aerosols and then spread through air.
While there are concerns that viruses can spread through fases, these risks are believed to be low.The most contagious virus in people's fight; although spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
>>zsm_Latn<< The European Disease Prevention and Control Center (ECDC) says that although it is not fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. This virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
>>zsm_Latn<< In particular, it was found that viruses could be detected for one day on cardboard/cardus, up to three days on plastic (polopropilen) and rust-proof steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on copper 99%.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
>>zsm_Latn<< Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products outline the layer of viral protective fat, deactivated viruses, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another solution, such as benzalconium chloride and glutonate chlorhexidin (disinfected surgery), is less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in the median two days after intensive treatment began.
>>zsm_Latn<< In five of the six patients, the first sample shows the highest virus charge, and the sixth patient shows the highest virus charge on the second day testing.
>>zsm_Latn<< Coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the coronavirus of a new acute acute respiratory syndrome, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory disease classmates in Wuhan.
>>zsm_Latn<< All new SARS-CoV-2 virus features exist in the coronavirus related to nature.
>>zsm_Latn<< Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which damages its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-CoV.
>>zsm_Latn<< Paru is the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesss host cells through an angiotensin modifier enzyme 2 (ACE2), the most abundant in lung-type alveolar cells.
>>zsm_Latn<< This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called αspike or tollan α (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
>>zsm_Latn<< Acute heart injuries are found in 12% of infected people who are inhaled in Wuhan, China, and more often on severe diseases.
>>zsm_Latn<< High cardiovascular symptoms levels due to the presence of systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during the development of disease, but acute miokard injuries may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
>>zsm_Latn<< ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in heart function.
>>zsm_Latn<< The high trombosis incident (31%) and tropomebolism of the vein (25%) found in patients of COVID-19 infection in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Otopsi in the person who died due to COVID-19 found the damage of the diffuse alveolar (DAD) and infiltrate inflammation that contained lymphocytes within the lungs.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for respiratory tract epithel cells that express ACE2, patients COVID-19 heavy have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
>>zsm_Latn<< In particular, T cells that secrete pathogenic GM-CSF are proven to correlate with monocyte recruitment that secretes IL-6 inflamatory and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lymphosic inflects have also been reported on otopsi.
>>zsm_Latn<< WHO has framed several testing protocols for this disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< The standard method of testing is the reaction of real-time transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR).
>>zsm_Latn<< This testing is usually done on breathing samples obtained through nasofaring conversation; however, a sample of nasal or scutum conversation can also be used.
>>zsm_Latn<< Generally, the results are available in several hours to two days.
>>zsm_Latn<< Blood testing can be used, but requires two blood samples taken at a distance of two weeks so the result has a small time value.
>>zsm_Latn<< Chinese scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus groove and frame its genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can develop testing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) independently to detect infection by this virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< On April 4, 2020, antibodies tests (which can detect active infections and if someone has been infected before) are in development, but have not been widely used.
>>zsm_Latn<< China's experience with the testing showed its accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
>>zsm_Latn<< The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month.The guidance of diagnosis released by Whan University's Zhongnan Hospital suggested a method of detecting infection based on clinical imagery and epidemiological risk.
>>zsm_Latn<< The multilobar-glass potential with peripheral distribution, asymmetric, and posterior many were found at the beginning of infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (abordination of lobular septum with alveolar filling varies), and consolidation can arise as the disease progresses.
>>zsm_Latn<< A little data is available about microscopic lesions and pathophysiology COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< The main pathological findings on the otopsi are:
>>zsm_Latn<< Macroscopes: pleurisi, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
>>zsm_Latn<< Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
>>zsm_Latn<< Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytes hyperplasia, large antitype pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphatic infiltration, and the formation of giant cells has many implications
>>zsm_Latn<< Heavy pneumonia: the damage of alveolar diffuses (DAD) with an alveolar exudat diffuses.
>>zsm_Latn<< DAD is the cause of acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) and heavy hypoxemia.
>>zsm_Latn<< Pneumonia in the healing stage: an exudate array in alveolar cavity and interstitial fibrosis pulmonary
>>zsm_Latn<< Blood: intravascular coagulation is studied (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reactions
>>zsm_Latn<< Prevention measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing higiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unsanitary hands.
>>zsm_Latn<< CDC recommends shutting the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or heating and recommending the use of the inside elbows if the tissue is not available.
>>zsm_Latn<< The appropriate hand Higiene after coughing or combing is encouraged.
>>zsm_Latn<< CDC recommends the use of face cover from cloth in public places, partly to limit transmission by people without symptoms.The social restriction strategy aims to reduce contact with people infected with many, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public places.
>>zsm_Latn<< Restriction guidelines also include people keeping distances at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
>>zsm_Latn<< No known effective drug prevents COVID-19.For the vaccine anticipated hasn't existed until the early 2021, the main part in dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as the αlimatic curve α.
>>zsm_Latn<< CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after from toilets or when hands look dirty, before eating, as well as after rubbing noses, coughs, or combs.
>>zsm_Latn<< Further CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand utilization that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In commercial hand exploiting areas are not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
>>zsm_Latn<< In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
>>zsm_Latn<< Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is not an active substance for hand antisepsis »
>>zsm_Latn<< Glisterol is added as a humutant.
>>zsm_Latn<< People are dealt with with support care, which can include liquid therapy, oxygen support, and support other affected vital organs.
>>zsm_Latn<< CDC recommends people who suspect they carry viruses to wear a simple face mask.
>>zsm_Latn<< Extracorporeum membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still considered.
>>zsm_Latn<< Self hygiene and lifestyle as well as healthy eating patterns are recommended to increase immunity.
>>zsm_Latn<< Supportive treatment may be useful in people who have mild symptoms at an early stage of infection. WHO and China's National Health Commission have published recommendations to deal with the terminally treated COVID-19 sufferers.
>>zsm_Latn<< Intensive and pulmonary care experts in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into free resources, namely IBCC.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< For symptoms, part of the medical power prefers parasetamol (assetaminephen) compared to ibuprofen for the use of the first line.
>>zsm_Latn<< Prevention measures must be taken to minimize the risk of viral transmission, especially in health care arrangements when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
>>zsm_Latn<< For health power treating COVID-19 sufferers, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Tular-Ra (AIIR) Isolation Room in addition to using standard prevention actions, contact prevention actions, and the prevention act of the soles. CDC outlines guidelines for the use of self-protecting tools (APD) during the pancreas.
>>zsm_Latn<< Recommended equipment is: APD cloak, respirator or face mask, eye protector, and medical gloves. If available, respirator (not face mask) is better.
>>zsm_Latn<< N95 was approved for industry order, but the FDA had authorized this mask to be used based on Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
>>zsm_Latn<< N95 was designed to protect from air-based particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents was not guaranteed for unmentioned use on the label.
>>zsm_Latn<< If masks are not available, CDC recommends using face protectors or, as a last attempt, self-made mask.
>>zsm_Latn<< Most cases of COVID-19 are not too heavy until it requires mechanical ventilation or its alternatives, but some cases are indeed heavy.
>>zsm_Latn<< The type of respiratory support for people who are experiencing a failure of breathing related COVID-19 is actively being researched for people who are inhaled, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal canal or bipositive airline pressure.
>>zsm_Latn<< It is not known if one of these two methods results in the same benefit to the person who is critically ill.
>>zsm_Latn<< Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical vents, when available, as these techniques limit the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal canulas. Heavy cases occur more in the elderly (a person over 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years of age).
>>zsm_Latn<< Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limit the capacity of the health system to deal with a sudden amount of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require instant treatment.
>>zsm_Latn<< A study in China found that 5% entered an intensive care unit, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
>>zsm_Latn<< In China, about 30% of patients with COVID-19 who were bribed eventually entered the ICU.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute breath syndrome (ARDS) occurs at COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
>>zsm_Latn<< Ventilators capable of high pressure control modes and PEEP are required to maximize oxygen delivery at once as well as minimize the risk of lung injury and ventilator-related pneumotoraks.
>>zsm_Latn<< High PEEP may not be available on the old ventilator.
>>zsm_Latn<< Research on the potential care begins in January 2020 and some antivirus drugs are in clinical trials.
>>zsm_Latn<< Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although the development of a new drug may take up to 2021, some of the drugs being tested are already approved for other use or are already in advanced testing.
>>zsm_Latn<< Antivirus drugs can be tried in people with severe diseases.
>>zsm_Latn<< The volunteers recommended WHO participated in the trials of effectiveness and security of potential treatment.The FDA has given temporary authorization to covalent plasma as experimental treatment in a person's life case is very or immediately threatened.
>>zsm_Latn<< Convalent Plasma has not yet undergone the clinical study necessary to prove its security and effectiveness for the disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< Users are asked to include their ID names and numbers.
>>zsm_Latn<< This application is able to detect 'close contact' using surveils data so it can detect the potential risk of infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
>>zsm_Latn<< If potential risks are detected, the application not only recommends self-containing quarantine, but also informs local health officers.Matical analyses on cell phone data, face recognition technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people who contact them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
>>zsm_Latn<< In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed a security agency to track the data of the alleged coronavirus terricular cell phone.
>>zsm_Latn<< The step is taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who may be contacted with infected citizens.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telecom distributed aggregates of telephone location data to the German federal government body, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect carantine offenders.
>>zsm_Latn<< Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera, said he was informed of the mobile phone operator that α40% of the citizens still continued to move out of place )
>>zsm_Latn<< The German government carried out a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
>>zsm_Latn<< In addition, Estonia's President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global call for creative solutions against coronavirus deployment.
>>zsm_Latn<< People can experience the pressure caused by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
>>zsm_Latn<< BBC quotes Rory O'Connor who says, - Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic decline is a perfect storm that endangers the mental health and well-being of the community -
>>zsm_Latn<< It can continue lightly or without symptoms, which resemble other common respiratory diseases, such as pickles.
>>zsm_Latn<< The mild case usually recovers in two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical illness may require three to six weeks to heal.
>>zsm_Latn<< Women may have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection weight based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still less. In part, COVID-19 can influence the lungs so as to cause pneumonia.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the most severe person affected, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute breathing amputation syndrome (ARDS) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or mamuk organ failure.
>>zsm_Latn<< The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
>>zsm_Latn<< Blood clotting disorders, particularly an increase in protrombin time, are observed in 6% of patients COVID-19 treated in a bribed, while kidney function abnormalities are seen at 4% of this group.
>>zsm_Latn<< About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 images show increased liver enzymes (transamines).
>>zsm_Latn<< According to the same report, the median time between the song of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent in the inap treatment.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, patients transferred to the ICU had a seven-day median time between inap treatment and death.
>>zsm_Latn<< In a study researching early cases, median time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
>>zsm_Latn<< In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men have a death rate of 2.8%, while women have a death rate of 1.7%.
>>zsm_Latn<< Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples shows diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromiksoid exudates in both lungs.
>>zsm_Latn<< Cytopathic changes are observed in pneumocytes.
>>zsm_Latn<< The pulmonary image resembles acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
>>zsm_Latn<< At 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage was observed, with increased troponin levels or heart rate.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to the March data from the United States, 89% of people who are being cared for in advance have built-in conditions.The availability of medical and social resources of an area's economy can also influence mobility.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Mortality estimate of conditions varies due to the differences in the region, but also due to the methodological difficulties.
>>zsm_Latn<< Lack of case count can cause death figures to be counted too high.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, the fact that death is the result of a case that has taken place in the past can mean the current Mortality number is calculated too low.
Perikok has a possible 1.4 times greater risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than those who are not smokers.
>>zsm_Latn<< The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a decrease in lung capacity 20% to 30% in some people recovering from disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
>>zsm_Latn<< It can also lead to post-intensive post-recovery post-recovery syndrome.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until March 2020, it is not known if the previous infection gave an effective and long-term immunity to a person recovering from the disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< Imunity is seen to be obtained, if it looks at other coronavirus behavior, but has been reported to be a case of COVID-19 recovery followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
>>zsm_Latn<< This case is believed to be a deteriorating remaining infection, and not a reinfected infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< This virus is thought to be natural and originated from animals, through spreading infections.
>>zsm_Latn<< Originally unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by transmission from man to man.
>>zsm_Latn<< A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, which was published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the date of the singing of the earliest symptoms was December 1, 2019.
>>zsm_Latn<< The official publication of WHO reported the earliest symptom singing on December 8, 2019.
>>zsm_Latn<< Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
>>zsm_Latn<< These numbers vary based on regions and over time, as well as are influenced by the amount of testing, quality of health care systems, management options, time since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, gender, and overall health.
>>zsm_Latn<< At the end of 2019, WHO established a code of U07.1 emergency ICD-10 disease for death from SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed laboratory and U07.2 for death due to clinically diagnosed COVID-19 or epidemiologically without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mortality ratio to the case reflects the number of deaths is divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a specified time interval.
>>zsm_Latn<< According to the University of Johns Hopkins statistics, the global mortality ratio to the case is 6.9% (53,82/2,240.191) by April 17, 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< The number varies based on the region. Other measurements include case validity figures (CFR), which reflect the percentage of diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the number of infections (IFR), which reflect the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
>>zsm_Latn<< These statistics are not bound time and follow a particular population from infection to case resolution.
>>zsm_Latn<< Although not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the plague episentrum in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village containing 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7%) is dead.
>>zsm_Latn<< In Gangalt, the disease is spread through the Karnaval festival, which spreads among young people, causing relatively lower morbidity, and possibly not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 death.
>>zsm_Latn<< Furthermore, the German health system had not yet been overwhelmed.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as tested from blood donors.
>>zsm_Latn<< 69 people (0,004% of the population) were compromised to death due to COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< The affect of the pancreas and its level of Mortality is different for men and women.
>>zsm_Latn<< Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
>>zsm_Latn<< The highest risk for men is at the age of 50s, with the same risk between men and new women not appearing at the age of 90.
>>zsm_Latn<< In China, death figures for men by 2.8 percent and for women by 1.7 percent.
>>zsm_Latn<< The definite reason for this gender-based difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be reasons.
>>zsm_Latn<< Immunological differences based on gender, lower smoking prevalence in women, and men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at age younger than women can contribute to higher mobility in men.
>>zsm_Latn<< In Europe, 57% of people infected are men and 72% of people who die because COVID-19 are men.
>>zsm_Latn<< Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< Studies show that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, influence men and women differently.
>>zsm_Latn<< Percentage of female genitals, particularly nurses, and they have a higher chance of exposure to viruses.
>>zsm_Latn<< The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease was αCOVID-19-
>>zsm_Latn<< Leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus explains that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the time of outbreaks first identified: December 31, 2019.
>>zsm_Latn<< The name was chosen to avoid reference to certain geographic locations (e.g. China), species of animals, or a group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatization. Virus that caused COVID-19 was named coronaviruses of acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
>>zsm_Latn<< WHO also uses the αvirus COVID-19 α and αvirus in charge of COVID-19 - in public communication.
>>zsm_Latn<< Both the disease and common virus are referred to as -cononavirus »
>>zsm_Latn<< At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as αcconavirus α and αchoronavirus Wuhakin-
>>zsm_Latn<< In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in accordance with 2015 guidelines urging not to use location names in the name of disease and virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< The official name of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was issued on February 11, 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< Due to the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital producers print health care materials such as nasal dialogue and ventilator components.
>>zsm_Latn<< In one example, when an Italian hospital greatly requires ventilator valves, and suppliers can't provide on a necessary time scale, a local company overruns and prints 100 valves required overnight.
>>zsm_Latn<< After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theory, incorrect information, and disinformation emerge concerning the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
>>zsm_Latn<< Humans seem to be able to spread viruses to some other animals.
>>zsm_Latn<< The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
>>zsm_Latn<< No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat this disease.
>>zsm_Latn<< International research on vaccines and COVID-19 drugs is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
>>zsm_Latn<< In March, the World Health Organization initiated -SOLIDARITY Trial - to study the effects of the treatment of the already four antivirus compounds with the most promising efficacy.
>>zsm_Latn<< The vaccine is not available, but various agencies are actively developing a vaccine candidate.
>>zsm_Latn<< Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
>>zsm_Latn<< There are three vaccine strategies that are being studied.
>>zsm_Latn<< First, researchers aim to create a complete viral vaccine.
>>zsm_Latn<< The use of the virus, whether the virus is inactive or dead, aims to rapidly trigger the response of the human body to new COVID-19 infection.
>>zsm_Latn<< The second strategy, subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits on the virus.
>>zsm_Latn<< In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on S-spike proteins that help viruses infiltrate ACE2 enzyme receptors.
>>zsm_Latn<< The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine ( DNA or RNA vaccine, new techniques for making vaccinations).
>>zsm_Latn<< Experimental vaccines made with these strategies should be tested to know its security and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
>>zsm_Latn<< Vaccin contains harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes disease. An increase in antibodies has been suggested as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this method is still controversial.
>>zsm_Latn<< There were more than 300 active clinical trials that were taking place in April 2020.
>>zsm_Latn<< Seven trials of evaluating treatments that have been approved for malaria, include four studies against hydroxiclorokuin or chlorokuin.
>>zsm_Latn<< The newly-purpose antivirus drug forms most of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in some countries with a brief reporting time in late April.
>>zsm_Latn<< By April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs was already present. Some of the antivirus drugs that were present were being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, which included remedesivir, chlorokuin and hydroxiclorokuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/tonavir combined with beta interferons.
>>zsm_Latn<< In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for remedeivir efficacy.
>>zsm_Latn<< A clinical improvement is observed in patients treated with remedeivir in emergency treatment.
>>zsm_Latn<< Phase III clinical trials were being conducted in the U.S., China, and Italy. Klorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, were studied in China in February 2020, with initial results.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, there is a call for peer review of the research.
>>zsm_Latn<< Korean and Chinese Health Authority recommends the use of chlorokuins.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, the Whaman Virology Institute, despite recommending daily doses of one gram, notes that double doses are very dangerous and can be deadly.
>>zsm_Latn<< On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued the authorization of emergency use for hydroxiclorokuin and chlorokuin over the doctor's policy that treated COVID-19 sufferers.The 7th edition Chinese guidelines also included interferon, petavirin, or maniphenavir to be used against COVID-19.
>>zsm_Latn<< Early data showed that high doses of satavirin were required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
>>zsm_Latn<< Nitazoxanida has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentration.Research shows that early priming against the protein highlights by the transmembrane protein series 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
>>zsm_Latn<< The study of chlorokuin and hydroxiclochrokuin with or without azitromation has great limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
>>zsm_Latn<< Sytokin storms complications can occur at COVID-19 heavy stages further.
>>zsm_Latn<< There is evidence that hydrocyclocrokuin may have antisitokin properties.Tociizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was completed.
>>zsm_Latn<< This drug is undergoing phase 2 randomized tests at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe diseases.
>>zsm_Latn<< Combined with serum feritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, this drug is intended to fight the cytokine storms, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
>>zsm_Latn<< In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA based on the study of retrospective case for the treatment of the cetokin release syndrome of steroid refractor which was induced by different causes, namely CAR T cell therapy.
>>zsm_Latn<< To date, there has been no random and controlled evidence showing that tociizumab is a potent treatment for CRS.
>>zsm_Latn<< Transfer the purified and compressed antibody produced by the cured person system of COVID-19 to the person who needs it is being studied as a nonvaxin passive immunization method.
>>zsm_Latn<< This strategy was tried for SARS with unconclusive results.
>>zsm_Latn<< Neutralization is a working mechanism expected for passive antibody therapy can mediate defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
>>zsm_Latn<< However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that depend on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
>>zsm_Latn<< Another passive antibody therapy form, for example, uses a monoclonal antibody produced, is in development.
>>zsm_Latn<< Convalent serum production, which is a fluid part of the patient's already cured blood and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be improved for faster use.
>>zsm_Latn<< Coronavius disease, a closely related group of syndromes
>>zsm_Latn<< Li Welliang, a doctor at the Whanan Center, who was then infected and died from COVID-19 after bringing up awareness of viral spread.
