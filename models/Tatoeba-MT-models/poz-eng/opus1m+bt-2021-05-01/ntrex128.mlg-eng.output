Welsh parliament members continued to say 'just like a puppet'
Some of the parliament’s members were impressed when they heard rumors that their call would be changed to MWP (Welsh Parliament Member).
This was the result of an attempt to change the name of the Welsh parliament.
All members of the parliament from all political colors fear that they will become the ridicule of people.
A member of a Labour party's parliament said his group was worried because it was \"fighting with Twp and Pwp\" as it was.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means dik.
Members of the Plaid party also said that all members — not happy — offered other suggestions.
A Welsh Traditionr said that his group has an open-ended - about the change of names, but he says MWP and Muppet are very close.
In this case, the letter —w — in Welsh — is similar to the English language in Yorkshire.
The Parliament Council, which is drafting a law to introduce the current changes of names, says: \"Of course only the members of the parliament will have the last word on which to call the Members of the Parliament\"
The Government of Wales 2017 gave Parliament Welsh the authority to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of questioning the people's opinion on the proposals, and it found that there were many who supported the call of Parliament Welsh.
As for the name to call the members of the parliament, it is that the Council's mind was in the hands of Parliament Welsh or WWP, but MWP is the most supportive option when asked about the opinions of the residents.
The parliament members also seem to have other suggestions, but the head of President Elin Jones, who should give the bill about the change in a few weeks, may be confused by a common search for consensus.
The reform law also speaks of some changes in the way Americans behave, such as rules on the removal of members of parliament in their place and the structure of the commission.
When members of the parliament are discussing the bill, they can vote last on the name to call them.
Macedonian voters vote during a referendum on the country's name change
On Sunday, voters will choose to be changed by the name of their country — the Republic of North Macedonia.
This is a reflection of a ten-year struggle with a neighboring country, Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
The Athenes officials have long confirmed that the name of his northern neighbor is disturbing to his territory, so he has continued to respond to the last request to join the European Union and the NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Mr. Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the public's request to change the name, said that he would think it would be as if there were no votes.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this change is only a response to entry into the European Union and NATO.
The St. Martin Cross is silent as the congregations in Harlem face war
\"In view of the story, the older men who talked to me told me that all the corners of the street had houses and churches,\" says Mr. Adams.
- Unfortunately, it’s all gone.
I can only say that he caused the drinking house to cease.
“People’s interaction has changed a lot — at present, he says.
- There's a lot of work to make the restaurant a rest room for regular people.
For the congregation again, he is concerned that the church leaders will not stand as the money they received from their sale, — or sooner or later they will return to their start —
The congregation, he said, may be replaced by a building that will be served, and that will be covered with such kind of people who will not be troubled by the remains of the holy places that are scattered around.
\"Most people will buy shelters from these buildings,\" he said, \"so sure the time for these churches to be close enough because most of the people who live there aren't sure to be members of the church\"
The two churches were established by white church members, when Harlem was not yet black - Great City in 1870, and became St. Martin ten years later.
The first white Methodist church to be formed left there in 1930.
Thus, a group of black believers gathered nearby took the house into possession.
Rev. John Howard Johnson led the black church to accept St. Martin, this officer led the residents to stop shopping for the total number of shoppers on 125th Street, Harlem street shopping, because they prevented black workers from being hired or black.
The house was badly damaged by drought in 1939, but if Momera Johnson’s church took him back, they set up a number of children's bills.
Rev. David Johnson, Mopera Johnson's brother and his successor to St. Martin, proudly called this many children's play-in-the-crowsy-
The expert who pointed out the many children's plays in July gave a different name: \"Criticism — and a historical background of no substitutes —
This expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted that it was the first number of children to be appointed by black musicians in the world, Dionosio A. Lind, who moved to the larger school in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that in St. Martin no longer sought men in his place.
In recent months the incident in St. Martin has been a little disturbed by the collaboration between the housekeepers and the repair company, some of which were brought to the church by the civic leaders, and others taken by the episcopal goddess.
The church council wrote to the diocese — the church’s administrative office, which included the mayors — in July said his concerns — to move the expense of the diocese — a church council, but the church council did not enter into the agreement with housekeepers and factories sent by the goddess.
Some churchmen complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
A 13-year-old child is attacked by an asphalt in Californie.
On Saturday, a 13-year-old boy in Californie was injured by an assassin's bite while the authorities took a bomb to collect raindrops on the day the fall season opened, says the authorities.
The accident took place at 7: 00 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel’s KSWB-TV account in San Diego, they had been in a crowd for half an hour on Saturday morning listening to the young man crying for help, and several of them quickly lost their boat to approach him and pull him out of the water.
I thought he was so happy that Hammel got a raindrop, but then he realized that he could call it \"I'm sorry!\"
I'm stuck!'
His bones were completely torn off the ground, which Hammel noticed when he arrived next to the boy.
- I cried so strongly that everyone came out quickly in the water: 'There is a gas in the water!' - Hammel said.
The boy was aired to the Lady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his life is still reportedly under threat.
It is not clear what kind of steel was affecting it.
Capt said in an interview with journalists. Larry Giles for relief said that people have seen a knife in the area these few weeks ago, but it is known that it is not the kind of masquerade that bites people.
Mr. Giles' upper portion of the victim's body was severely injured by a bite.
Authorities shut down the beach for 48 hours to Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for investigating and protecting people's lives.
More than 135 Mr. Giles says the typical brand of tarsans in the region, but most of them are thought to be unattractive.
Sainsbury's strategy is marching into the market of a macassette in Royaume-Uni.
Sainsbury's came to compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and using a special skill-based meat-like home-building site.
In an intense search for a place in the 2,8 billion-billion-style Livres market in Royaume-Uni, where fashion and furniture markets are growing steadily, 11 stores around the country will be tested, and they will be picked up to other stores if they appear to be successful.
At the time that the big store is looking for how to use the TV shopping sites, the main micro-ondes and the most ancient items are coming up with money in the form of a moth.
Sainsbury's said it will double the size of the moss square, which will reach as many as 3,000, and will be marked as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will be the first.
The most widely seen types of activity such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have a broader location and will give the same characteristics as those seen in the market such as Boots.
This big store also provides the kind of energy for the development of the look in the bots to keep the market’s products in particular — according to a steady demand from young marketers.
On the other hand, Phragrance Shop, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, will also try to assign a special vendor to the Sainsbury store, and the second will open at the end of this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As the number of people who choose to shop online and buy fewer meals a day in the city market increases, big stores have to make a lot of effort to attract people to visit them.
Mr. Mike Coupe, director general of Saisbury's, said that their sales will become more and more like a big store as they are tried by big stores against consumers like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products other than food.
Sainsbury's shop Argos has put a lot of money on the market, and he has added many Habitas since the time he bought two stores two years ago, stating that the daily sales and increased profits from his stores have increased dramatically.
The former efforts of this big store to bring new life to the nature of the father’s face and the sale of hers have been cut short.
In early 2000, Sainsbury's tried to spend money with Boots, but the partnership was ruined by the dispute over the sharing of money from the shop shopkeeper's stores.
This new scheme was born three years ago when the Sainsbury's 125 million Livres sold to Celsio, owned by the association of the 281 pharmaceutical network of Lloyds Pharmacy.
He claimed that Lloyds would have a role in this format, adding a wider set of fruits for such skin-skilled brands as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
In particular, Dr. Paul Mills-Hicks, director of the trade in Sainsbury's, said: \"We have fully adapted the outside appearance and experience that is available in our cultural development to make the world better for us customers.
We also used the money on top of the special training colleagues, who were ready at all times to comment.
There's a product that is up to the needs of everyone in us and that because of the attractive and general setting we've become an indispensable place for a fascist, changing the old style of market -
Peter Jones would have been 'strong' if Holly Willoughby had broken the 11 million Livres deal
Peter Jones, the best-known player in Dragons Den, was so deeply impressed by the fact that Holly Willoughby, television broadcaster, rejected the 11 million Livres deal with his business of living, because he instead focused on the new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly's toolsman's brand.
People said this trade was similar to the Goop brand that Gwyneth Paltrow's.
On Instagram the present 37-year-old This Morning program host said he had broken the contract.
Peter Jones, the best-known player on Dragons Den, was so overwhelmed by Holly Willoughby's latest appeal to the banking company’s money-funded business - that he rather focused on his new deal with Marks & Spencer and the ITV.
Jones’s claim to be \"surprising\" when Jones admitted the most lucrative TV host at a Tuesday meeting at Marlow's main company office, Buckinghamshire, that as a result of the new agreements he received — as long as 1.5 billion Livres — he no longer had time to be separated from the Tally factory brand.
People compared this trade with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and thought that Willoughby's wealth, which is estimated to be 11 million Livres, would double.
Jones, who left Grande Bretagne for one of his vacation homes, told Instagram, now 37 years old, that he would be separated from Truly.
One source says: \"Truly is the first priority for Holly.
This is what their far-reaching future will depend on, and will guarantee it for the next ten years.
Everyone heard his decision to leave.
Not everyone believed when he heard what happened on Tuesday, because the date he was about to open was very close.
There's a store full of goods ready to be sold in Marlow's headquarters -
According to experts, the release of the show host This Morning, which is one of the most expensive stars in Britain, could cause millions of losses to the company, as well as because of the money spent on various products such as red, clothing, and equipment, and because it could slow the start date.
Their long-term friendship may also end there.
Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, are best friends with Willoughby, having three children, and his wife Dan Baldwin.
Capp and Willoughby were co-founding the Truly company in 2016, and in March Jones, 52, came to occupy the position of the Director.
Both are on vacation and Jones has 40 percent of the funds in Baldwin's retail firm.
Willoughby is now seeing the role of the M&S character alphabet and will replace Ant McPartlin with the presentation of the I'm A Celebrity program on ITV.
A news source close to Jones last night said — We can’t talk about his business situation —
\"But we love each other\"
He joked the journalist's criticism of him for making a comment that people would think wasn’t — it's worth the place of the president of North Korea — and because he had the hope of North Korea.
Why was President Trump so tolerant?
Mr. Trump replied and took like the voice of the new offerer —
- I never put up with that. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Kim wants to hold a second meeting, when Mr. Trump said that their first meeting in Singapore last June was a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, the debate on the disarming of nuclear weapons is still suspended.
More than three months after a peak meeting in Singapore last June, Mr. Ri Yong Ho announced the North Korean top diplomat in front of the United Nations Assembly last Saturday that North Korea has not seen a similar attack — in its first stages of disarming the United Nations.
He even added that the United States would continue the punishment aimed at putting more pressure on us.
Trump's way in his speech during the campaign is more hopeful than that.
- Our dealings with North Korea are very difficult,” she says.
\"We've been heading for North Korea's war reading.
Nearly a million people have died.
But now we have a good relationship with them —
Their efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have brought good results — the fusée was stopped, the hostages were released and the American military's bones were returned home.
And she has carefully hidden the unusual view she expresses when talking about her relationship with Kim.
- It's very easy to behave like the President, but we'd rather see 200 people standing here than seeing 10,000 people outside this crowded square,” Trump said, and she's staring at the people who gathered in front of her.
A island in Indonesia is destroyed by tsunamis and earthquakes, hundreds are killed
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, non-governmental organizations received a message that their help was unnecessary.
Although more than 10 percent of the population in Lombok have been affected, no natural disaster statement has been issued, but this is needed to provide international assistance.
- Often, it’s sad that they made it clear that they didn’t ask for international help, so we were a bit too busy,” says Rtoa Sukong.
Even though the Save the Children are preparing a team to be sent to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign workers will be able to work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the disaster office, said that Indonesian authorities are still looking at the situation in Palu to see if they are given permission to assist international offices.
Given Indonesia's regular earthquake, the country's incompetence to face the wrath of nature can be very dangerous.
Of course, there is a shelter if there is a tsunami in Aceh, but the city that forms the other coast does not.
The fact that there was no warning in Palu may have been one of those who had been killed.
Even in the most trouble-free times, it is difficult to travel among the many islands making up Indonesia.
The existence of natural disasters has only made things so difficult for the logistics.
A hospital ship was called in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake that led to Palu, but it would be at least three days away from the disaster area.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving the rotary infrastructure in Indonesia during his election campaign, and he was throwing a lot of money and scraps on the roads and roads.
Mr. Joko's rule is a big deal but the lack of money, especially he will be facing elections in the coming year.
The conflict between different beliefs in Indonesia is also a problem waiting for Mr. Joko, as there are many Muslim believers living in a way that retains more traditionality.
More than 1,000 people have been killed or fled because of the conflict between Christians and Muslims on the streets, using a mass, a piece of weapons.
See: Liverpool's player Daniel Sturridge killed the long-range boat equaling Chelsea's number
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Chelsea's Premier League on Saturday for his89-minute football at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a service from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 27 meters away from Chelsea's dress, which led to 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left first, which he had just forced for the most distant party.
The ball went up very high, saving his right corner of the net.
The ball then passed over Kepa Arizabalaga, who jumped high and got into a net.
- I just tried to save the place, that I got the ball, a player like Shaq who always sent the ball in the first place, which is why I tried to create a long time as I could,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
\"I went to Kante and I thought of the ball once, then I didn't think so much of myself, and I just dropped it right away\"
Chelsea led 1-0 on vacation as the Babylonian star Hazard killed a ball in the 25th minute.
It was then that the Blues soldier returned the football provided by Matthew Kovacic, and then suddenly turned around near the center of the stadium and ran fast towards Liverpool's middle guard.
Kovacic was offering football in the center of the stadium and quickly ran away.
Then he forced the ball through a lot of players and led Hazard to the party.
Hazard lost his grip on the side of the outback and arrived in front of the most distant tree, so he threw the ball away from Liverpool's dresskeeper Alisson Becker on the left.
Liverpool will face Napolo on Wednesday 3 p.m. during a daily battle in the Champions League, in San Paolo Square in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet Videoton in London on Thursday 3 p.m., in the EUFA Europe League.
The number of tsunamis in Indonesia killed 832
The number of deaths caused by earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia is 832, says the disaster office on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have survived under the collapsed earthquake building that reached 7.5 on the scale, resulting in a wave of up to 6 metres, says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the speaker at the press conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by rubble and wood from destroyed houses.
A 32-year-old suspected man was arrested by police and killed a woman in her heart.
The investigation of the killings opened up this morning after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman's body was full of dead bodies when someone found her at 7 hours and 55 minutes in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected of killing her.
Police have sent them to a neighbor who could see or hear something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is about to begin, but it's asking the surrounding people to see or hear something that is suspicious of me to come to us.
I also make a call for people, especially taxi drivers, to receive photos from their cars that might help with our investigations.'
Police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman was a resident in Birkenhead and found her in the house.
This afternoon a friend who was supposed to know my mistress came to the site asking where her body was well seen in the morning.
The investigation continues, and the police say they are now sharing news with relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was about to return home but was stopped by the police because no one was allowed to enter or exit the house before.
He was shocked when he learned what happened next.
Its residents are now informed that they may be able to spend hours in their homes.
Someone heard the police told a man that the whole area is now viewed as the scene of the crime.
A woman came to the place and cried.
He kept saying that.
On 2 p.m., there were two police vehicles in the uninhabitable area, and another car was waiting outside.
A number of police were standing in the uninhabitable area, monitoring the entire building.
The news reporters are asked to send a live message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or send anonymous messages to Crimestoppers by the number 0800 555 111 to state the 227th issue on September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament was the last collection the 'recorded history' has ever been hit by a series.
The removal seems to come back in poetry, in response to its destruction in a way similar to that of the Taliban’s cultural and religious heritages in England by its former followers who claim to be religious strict.
The Cromwell Society has stated that the proposal from Mr. Crick is \"stupid\" — and is intended to re-writing the story —
Mr. John Goldsmith, editor of the Cromwell Association, said: \"There is no way to get around in this debate about the memorial blast that Oliver Cromwell's image of the Westminster Palace must be discussed as well.
Cromwell, however, did not command or execute the destructions of images and statues that took place during the UK's civil war.
Cromwell was not to be sacrificed for what Mr. Thomas had done in the past hundred years.
Cromwell's beautiful face is indeed made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft and a remarkable evidence for the opinion found in the 19th century and part of the image showing the story of a character featured that many today think is still worthy of honor.
The Sunday Telegraph, Mr. Goldsmith, stated: \"There are many people today, and even more than in the late 19th century, consider Cromwell to be a defender of parliament not to be subjected to outside pressure, in his day it is clear that the king and the officers have done so.
However, the monument is still a historical debate to this day as to whether the monument is a true expression of its nature.
Sure enough, the controversy has been developing in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell is a well-known symbol of one aspect of the relationship.
His work as a Lord Protector is also worthy of being celebrated and remembered — . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
A Chinese farmer dies of pig bites
A local journalist said he was killed by a pig bite in a market in the southwestern China.
The man, known as \"Yuan,\" was found near a pighouse, where he was found to have a massive blood vessel broken into him, he was totally bleeding at the Liupanshiu market in the province of Guizhou, as South China Morning Post said on Sunday.
A pigkeeper is preparing to read pigs at the pork market on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
The second Wednesday came from Yunnan province on the other side to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning they saw their dead bodies, and they perceived that the door of a pig's house was opened.
There he saw a big man with his mouth in his mouth.
When the doctors conducted a survey, they confirmed that a 250 - pound [250 kg] male pig had destroyed the farmer and killed him, reports the report.
\"My brother's feet are torn and broken,\" says his brother, named \"Wu,\" as he told Guiyang Evening News.
A video film of the surveillance camera shows that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His remains were seen as an hour later.
The beast that killed him was not even Yan's or his brother's.
The market administrator told Evening News that the pig was first shut down to keep other people from attracting, until the local evidence was discovered by the police.
The Yuan family and the market authorities seem to be dealing with the compensation due to his death.
There has always been, though, a rare incident that has been reported to have caused people to be bitten by pigs.
In 2016 a married couple were tied to their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was severely injured.
Ten years earlier, a large pig weighing 295 pounds [2.5 kg] of the tracteur had forced a Welsh farmer to throw away the animal.
Another time a farmer in Oregon was kidnapped by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pig should never be attacked but that it could be ααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααααα αααααα ααα αααααααααααα αααααααααα ααα α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α ααααααααααααα α α αααα α α ααα α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α ααα α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α α

What remains of the Rosa Storm will bring much rain to the southwest side of the United States
According to weather analysts, Rosa’s power was reduced when colder water was obtained in the south of Mexico’s northern coast.
Rosa, however, will bring a lot of water across the north side of Mexico and the southwestern United States for several days.
Rosa’s wind took up to 135km an hour, which is said to be the 1st Sunday morning storm on the 5th of the East, and on the west 620 km of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is supposed to go north on Sunday.
On the other hand, a dépression begins to form in the Pacific Ocean, the eastern horizon to the western coast of the United States As Rosa approaches the Baja Californie on Monday as a tropical storm, the tropical storm will begin to push the southwestern U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rain up to 25 cm in many parts of Mexico.
Therefore, because of the connection between tropical humidity to the approaching dépression, heavy rains will rise in the southwest part of the day for several days.
If a region gets as much rain as 2.5 cm to 10 cm, there will be dangerous flooding, deforestation, and landslides in the wild.
As a result of heavy tropical droughts, there will be as much rain as 5 cm to 8 cm per hour in some areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected, however, that the rain falls from 5 cm to 10 cm in some areas of the southwest, especially across Arizona.
There may also be flooding due to the sudden deterioration of the weather as tropical rain spots are spreading.
It is important to stop walking out of the world because of the possible tropical rainfall.
As a result of heavy rains, the canon can break into strong rivers and there will also be violent winds and heavy dust as a result of the rain.
The dépression also comes with heavy rains in some parts of the southern coast of Californie.
There may be a rain storm of up to 1.5 cm, which can lead to leaks full of garbage and clear roads.
This is the first rain in the region for the summer.
On Sunday evening and Monday morning, there will be tropical rains scattered toward Arizona, before the rains will rise on Monday evening and Tuesday.
From Tuesday to Wednesday, rain will rise throughout the Four Corners.
In October, temperatures around the United States may change dramatically as Arctique will cool, but the surrounding tropics are still hot.
Sometimes this may lead to significant changes in the temperature of a nearby location.
On Sunday there is a very significant example of this dramatic change in temperature across the central part of the United States.
The contrast between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, will almost reach 20 degrees for example.
In the next few days, the heat left in the spring will try to gather and regrow.
It is expected that the beginning of October will be heated to most of the central and eastern regions of the United States, with temperatures from the South Plain to the eastern North.
Tuesday the temperature may reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit [80 ° C] in New York City, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
It is estimated that the temperature will rise to the average temperature for the eastern part of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's epic testimony, expected to be appointed as a member of the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, accusing her of engaging in sexual misconduct in her late 1980s, on six television shows.
On the other hand, political controversies continue, and television has blocked its approach to report on the most unexpected cases: an agreement formed by the Arizona General Jeff Flyake to allow the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Ms. Ford said in front of the Senate Law Commission that he was sure 100 percent that Mr. Kavanaugh was drunk one day and had his visits met and wanted to remove his clothes at a lycée student party.
Mr. Kavanaugh responded, during a bold witness, but he was assured 100 percent that it wasn't.
It seems certain that more than 20,4 million people reported on by Nielsen followed.
The company has proposed a television network of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number for other TV broadcasts, such as the PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network, is still unknown.
Nielsen is often a little too busy to measure the number of viewers at work.
When there is a simple comparison, it is similar with either the Américain football audience or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel has been a frontline for all televisions, where investigators have been actively supporting the appointment of Mr. Kavanaugh, as its audience's participation reached 5,69 million during its long-term oral arrest, says Nielsen.
The second was ABC, with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million viewers, 2.94 million NBC, MSNBC found 2,89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still very interested after the interrogation.
Mr. Flyake was the focus of all during the turning point in the history of Friday.
When this Republican Modéré's office announced that he would support Mr. Kavanaugh in the vote, the CNN and CBS were able to download a photo album from the protesters while attempting to enter the aceneur to get a hearing for him by the Law Commission.
He stood up but looked down in the crowd for several minutes, as can be seen on CNN television.
\"I am standing before you now,\" said one woman.
- Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
Someone told her that you have authority, but many women don't see it.
A statement from my office has already been published by Mr. Flyake, and he added before the ascenseur concluded that he was still saying something else during his military speech.
The television broadcasts on the train and the satellite followed a live program at the time when the Council of the Constitution made a vote on the announcement of the appointment of Mr. Kavanaugh to the entire Senate.
But Mr. Flyake announced that he would not do so if it was not accepted that the FBI would investigate for a week on the charge of this targeted person, as the Democratic minority requested.
Among those who convinced Mr. Flyake were the conversations he had with his friend, General Chris Coons, Democrats.
Mr. Flake decided after a discussion with Mr. Coons and a few elders later.
There was a force that was chosen by Mr. Flake because it was evident that the Republicans would not have enough to accept the appointment of Mr. Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation of the charges against Mr. Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accused his critics of playing a 'political game' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused security critics of leaving the European Union, of ‘making a 'political game’ in the future of Britain and deploring the country’s interests during a discussion with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May, September 29, 2018, arrived at the Conservateur Party’s opening meeting in Birmingham, Britain.
In a conference near one where the former foreign minister, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, confirmed his accusation of the so-called Chequers' format for Brexit, stating that it is ← funny — the proposal that both Bretagne and the European Union should take the due tax.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being involved in the murder of LSU's player
The police arrested a suspect of a shooting in the LSU, a 20-year-old basketball player named Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned for a deliberate murder, says the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Public officials have published the video of the dispute between Sims and Simpson, and the police have announced that Sims' slogan was lost during the war.
Police took the mask from where the crime occurred, and reported that Simpson had found DNA in his presence, according to WAFB's report, working for CBS.
When Simpson was taken to his mouth, the police told him that he had agreed to have shot and killed Wayde.
His temporary independence rate was estimated to be 350,000, says one lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Office published a temporary report on Friday, which is said to have led to death from head to neck.
The service blessed the prosecution team of people who had fled to state police in Louisiana, the state police department, the Southern University police police and the citizens surrounding the investigation and were able to do this arrest.
Mr. Joe Alleva, an athlete's director at LSU, thanked the regional security forces for their ongoing search for the truth —
Sims is 20 years old now dead.
This 1m82 head figure was big in Baton Rouge, and his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LSU in the city.
During the past year, he was able to get 5,6 and get 2.6 football captures per game in general.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball trainer, Mr. Will Wade, said that the team was in a state of shock — and — after hearing of Wayne's death.
- That's what people worry about at all times, - Mr. Wade.
Mexico City’s volcano publishes ashes
Explosive ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern city of the capital of Mexico.
The National Institute warned the Mexicans of preventing natural disasters on Saturday to avoid the volcano because something was found in his mouth and the number of gas emissions and ash recorded within 24 hours was 183.
The close eye also has a number of noises and vibrations followed by the center.
Photos of ash covering the traffic in many cities around Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, are spreading on social networks.
Geographers and the earth’s flesh note that the volcano's occurrence has increased from 72 km south east of the capital to the 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit Mexico's central center in September 2017.
The volcano called \"Don Goyo\" has been alive since 1994.
Police and Catalan rebels clash as the memorial of the vote for independence approaches
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday when the independence protesters clashed with the police, and thousands joined the march to mark Catalogne's first anniversary for the secession.
A number of people have sided with the police-led separatists who will not move forward, but have given in to eggs and powder, so that the roads should be covered with black dust at such times.
In the evening there was also a coronation, and the police used a typhoid to get rid of the fighting.
A group of independenceists chanted for hours, \"No one forgets, no forgiveness there\" was met with supporters of the country shouting, \"Let Espanne live long\"
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries to protesters, local journalists say.
The struggle is still on two stages of independence, a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid said was illegal, but was celebrated by Catalians.
Almost all voters voted for independence, but few came to vote because those who opposed independence refused to participate in the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year while the police were about to prevent the stoning in a fierce battle that swept across the region.
A group of independent people watched during Friday night to prevent those who planned to protest in support of the national police.
The road was still on the road but had to use a different path.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electric operator who attended the rebel movement with his wife, said that he no longer believed Catalogne would have independence one day.
- Last year we had one of the best things in life.
I remember my parents crying out for joy because we could have a vote, but now we're just a street, she says.
Even though Catalan’s independenceists were able to win a victory, where the big life depended on even a small number of civil elections last December, the party was very difficult this year to maintain the determination that he had earned because many of his leaders went to the same office or to be in prison waiting for a trial for their role in administering the public council and declaring independence later.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old driver, who is filming the protest in support of police on his mobile phone, has announced that politicians from both sides are fighting this dispute.
- Bounds are constantly getting tough, she says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been imprisoned since last year, announced that he would qualify as a member of the European Parliament in the following year.
← Standing up as a candidate for the European election is the best way to read down the rich democratic values and the hardwood pressure we see by the Spanish regime,” she says.
London: A group of men arrested in the house · Global Voices
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years of age, were arrested when a car hit a house in London several times.
The incident took place in the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7 o'clock and a few BST evenings.
The door and wall of the house were the most damaged, says Det Insp Bob Blemmings.
Perhaps someone shot a knife to the house that evening as well.
Livingston defeated Rangers by Menga's brother 1-0
The victory was won by Dolly Menga's first win for Livingston
Livingston suddenly lost the Rangers, a second defeat for Steven Gerrard in his 18th game as the leader of the Ibox team.
It was Dolly Menga's team that changed things, as Gary Holt's team grew to be like the Hibernian second.
Gerrard's team has not yet won a national victory in the Premiership this year and today they face Hearts, which is the top number of eight.
Earlier, however, on Thursday, Rapid Vienna will receive the Rangers in Europe League.
Livingston has never been lost in this recent dance game, since Holt trainers have always won a victory since he paid Kenny Miler a month.
Livingston Can't Cope With Harmless Foreigners
Holt's team continued on its way before her death, as their integrity of attack has created a variety of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson was injured but the ball didn't turn away when he looked at the head, then Alan Lithgow could do nothing but sneak out when he was caught in a trap, the ball that Craig Halkett had hit on his head.
The landlords did not bother to allow the Rangers to play in front of them, as he knew he could have put the visitors in trouble with a high order.
And that's exactly how the number changed the domain.
The Rangers made a mistake in bringing up the coupling-franc and Livingstone sought a way to get around, including Declan Gallagher and Robinson to give Menga a way, which finally won the ball and jumped out of the center of the square.
Rangers, however, were still blocked in the area, but they were unable to pass the owner's estate, so there was little danger of Liam Kelly's dresskeeper,
This seems to have been the case during the second half, even though a shot from Alfredo Morelos had to be arrested quickly by Kelly.
Scott Pittman also nearly killed a ball but was hired by Allan McGregor, a Rangers' nurse, and then Lithgow's shoes were also very different if he received a good draft service from Livingston's player.
The impact on Livingston's dress was constant, but it was always blocked, and there were also two pens — one as a result of Halket's mistake with Glenn Middleton's replacement player, and one as a result of a hand - but all being beaten out.
Livingston’s 'Nothing like that' - research
Alasdair Lamont, from BBC Scotland, at the Macaroni Arena City
Livingston’s games and products were not the same.
They haven't done anything on their own, and never stop doing more than they think they might have done so far.
There has not been much change in their way of playing and building the team since they were able to make their way up to the top, but Holt is particularly praised for his ability to unite the team until he arrives.
There are also a lot of heroes in his team.
The work of the captain Halkett, leading to the best protection, Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to go long during the game.
However, the Rangers did not seem to see much of the explosion.
Their games may at times have been good under Gerrard's leadership, but they have not reached the norm here.
Their attacks are not always over — they are just once trapped from the side of the square — and now should be a warning to the Rangers, as they are now out of position.
Erdogan’s presence in Cologne is very diverse
On Saturday (September 29) was seen in the morning meal shared by the president of Turquie and allelemagne in Berlin.
This was the last day of the critical visit made by President Erdogan in Allemagne — which was intended to reestablish the relationship between rivals within NATO.
Among the issues they have not shared are human rights, freedom of press and Turquie's entry into the European Union.
President Erdogan later won Cologne to set up a new big mosquée.
This city is home to the largest Turkish people outside Turuie.
For security reasons, 25,000 people were prevented by police from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see their president.
The majority, however, were also opposition to Erdogan — and Kurdes — expressing their opinion, condemning Erdogan's politics and Allemagne's approval to take her to live with him.
The image of the foreigner causing the break is seen in the opposite protest, which some Turks have called German citizenship a savior, but others have accused him of being a dictator.
Deptford traffic station: The bus driver hit dead · Global Voices
The motorcyclists in London lost their lives.
The accident took place near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street branch, a popular street in Deptford, in the south east of the city, at 10 o’clock and 15am BST.
The driver stopped, and a doctor came to care, but the man died without water.
What happened to this tragedy was months after a driver killed in a car crash that ran on Childers Street, a half mile [a kilometer] and a half away from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were trying to find out about the man and inform his family.
The road was blocked so the driver had to take a walk and the driver was asked to choose another route immediately.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards injured during the falls
Six prison guards were injured during the fall in a safe prison for men, says the prison office.
Sunday morning at 9 o'clock and some BST started the riot at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire; and has not ended yet.
Specially trained police called \"Torndo\" were invited to work on the riots, which can make eight prisoners, in one corner of the prison.
Prison guards were treated locally for the mild injuries on their faces.
The prison service stated: “There are special prison guards who have been asked to face problems that occur in HMP Long Lartin.
Six prison guards received medical treatment for their injuries.
We don't give up the violence in the prison, and we clearly say that the defendants must be delivered to the police and may help with the time they are in prison —
The HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including the country's most threatened prisoners.
According to a June report, the prison chief was forced to be hospitalized after being beaten by a prisoner.
And in October some prison guards were forced to call police officers to trouble the prison because of a massive ballard football match.
The Rosa hurricane is threatening to bring water to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (it may be an advantage to drought areas)
The tropical dépression is not available in Arizona, but that's exactly what will happen at the beginning of the next week, as the remaining swarms of mosquitoes in the Rosa Storm are moving through the Desert Southwest, and are expected to cause flooding.
The national weather analyst, for Monday and Tuesday west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, has issued a fierce warning to California and Utah, including the city of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa was expected to drive to Phoenix on Tuesday evenings.
The Phoenix’s national climate analysts tweeted that the tropical storm was able to cope with the tropical or dépression test after within 260 km around Phoenix was only ten — until 1950!
Katrina (1967) was the only storm that reached as far as 60 km near the AZ province.
According to the latest estimates issued by the National Disaster Institute model, the rain may reach 5 cm to 10 cm, and it may reach 15 cm in the Moglon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of Desert Southwest, such as the central Rockies and the Great Basin, may be up to 2.5 cm to 5 cm, but there may be some place to get up to 10 cm.
For those who are not concerned about getting fresh water, Rosa’s rain may be a blessing because it is a region of drought.
Of course, flooding is a serious problem, but rain may be good because Southwesterns are now here.
According to the U.S. Department of drought monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona is the worst drought, the second most severe category, reports weatherer.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to enter land on the streets of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On the 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico is located the Revolutionary Rosa, which travels to the north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm's power is decreasing as cold water strikes in the Pacific Ocean.
So it is thought that he will become a trophy when the afternoon or evening of Monday comes to Mexico.
Mexico's rainfall can be severe, and it could cause great floods.
- It is estimated that Baja California will get to the northwest of Sonora, and it may even reach 25 cm in some places,” weather.com says.
Rosa, who is then trophy trophy, will then cross the north of Mexico, before arriving in Arizona’s province on Tuesday morning in a tropical form, she will return to Arizona and arrive in the south of Utah on Tuesday evening.
- The heavy rains in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and Desert Southwest in the United States are the most significant threat that Rosa or her colony is supposed to be affected by,” says the National Institute of Disaster.
As a result of that rain there is fear of the consummation of mighty waters, whereupon the waters of the wilderness overflow with trees and rocks, in a desert place, and the land passes through on the mountains.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Victims of Murder · Global Voices
Three boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected of attempted murder when a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, on Saturday till 4am BST.
He was immediately taken to the hospital and reported to be — without concern — his life.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested that night around Radstock, says Avon and Somerset Police.
The police let people who could have received a photo album know what happened on their mobile phone to approach them.
'Kavanaugh was subjected to the wrath and anger of the Democratic Party', says Mr Trump.
\"The vote for Justice Kavanaugh is a vote for the rejection of the unsustainable and shameful strategy of the Democratic Party,\" says Mr. Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr. Trump declared that during the arrangement for the appointment of Kavanaugh was — the last of the violent and angry — the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh witnessed against Congress, and he flatly rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of committing an act of sexual immorality against him decades ago, while they were both children.
Ford also came to bear witness about his accusation during this time.
Saturday's President said that the American people were aware of Kavanaugh’s intelligence, skill, and courage that day.
\"The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that assigns one of the best legal experts in our lifetime, a well-known judge of the public service since,\" he told the group of supporters who attended him in West Virginia.
The President took advantage of his appointment to speak to Mr. Kavanaugh.
- In the last few weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will come.
I don't fall for elections, but actually I fall for election,” she says.
- That's what makes me go through the war for the best candidates —
Atoa Trump claimed that the Democrats are taking a march — a fight and a break — at least.
The first important vote in the Senate in the order for appointment of Mr. Kavanaugh should take place on Friday, the top GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds have died from earthquakes, tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims is growing steadily
Less than 384 lives were saved, many of which were wiped out by massive sea waves on the coast, following a massive earthquake and tsunami that took place on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said the following Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered to attend a festival on the beach in Palu, where sea waves reached six meters across the beach in the morning, killing many and destroying all that he had covered.
Before the tsunami there was a 7.5 earthquake on the scale.
—In the wake of yesterday's tsunami alarm, people continued to do so on the beach but did not flee, only to become victims,” said U.S. Sutopo Purwo Nugroh, a BNPB spokesman, a natural disaster office in Indonesia, during a conference in Jakarta.
- The tsunami did not come alone, but it ran by car, trunk, house, dreaming of everything it was in the dry land,” says Nugroho, adding that the tsunami's turn on the sea took up to 800 km an hour before it closed the surface.
Someone took a stick from the tsunami, and he didn't kill it, he said.
A total of 16,700 people were transferred to 24 asylums in Palu.
Photos taken from a plane released by a natural disaster office show that many houses and shops are destroyed, bridges are stolen and destroyed and mosquee surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the waves left by the earthquake were still rocking the city of the sea.
There were 2.4 million people living in the region who felt the quakes.
The Indonesian Agency for the assessment and implementation of technology (BPPT) said that the heavy Friday earthquake caused the power of the atom bomb to fall in Hiroshima during World War II had nearly 200 times greater power.
The geography of the city, which is located at the base of a low-sized bay, may have increased the magnitude of the tsunami, they say.
Nugroho has claimed that the damage — the destruction and thousands, he said, the homes, hospitals, markets and hotels have collapsed.
There were dead bodies in the building, he said, and the injured were 540 and 29 were missing.
Nugroho creates the coast, says Nugroho, which may have been more affected and ruined in the Doyata region, 300 km north of Palu, as it is the nearest center of the earthquake.
- The communication is very loud because there is no news to get through - from Dolawa, says Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” says the Red Cross in the statement, and its employees and volunteers have been able to save their devastated areas.
- It's really cruel, but the situation can be worse than this,” she says.
Saturday's service received much criticism because it did not say that Palu had a tsunami, even though the authorities said that shortly after the warning came.
A public photo album was circulated on social networks with men on the floor calling out loud for people on the street below that there were tsunamis.
A few minutes after that, a wave of waves covered the coast, taking it from house to house.
Reuters could not verify the identity of the image file.
As a result of the earthquake and tsunami, nearly all the city's lights were cut off and no one was able to communicate around Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to manage the emergency effort.
The authorities say the army has begun to launch a cargo plane, bringing aid from Jakarta and other cities, but many of the displaced people still need food and cojaja fast every day.
The city airport has been opened for relief first, and will continue to shut down until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is said to visit the camps where the victims were placed in Palu.
More than 800 died from tsunamis in Indonesia.
This is a real danger.
It is true that World Vision workers from Doyata, who have been sheltering workers in a tent in the neighborhood of their workplace, have returned safely to Palu, but they have seen many damages along the way, says Mr. Doseba.
- They found a lot of destroyed houses, he said.
This is a real danger.
There are now many relief groups starting after disaster relief work, but some complain that a very experienced foreign worker with aid has been prevented from going to Palu.
According to the Indonesian law, there must be a national statement that an infected area has suffered from natural disasters before it could bring financial, configuration and foreign workers.
However, there was no such thing as a statement.
—The natural disaster has hit more and more in the past,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
- When the government says, \"Yes, the whole country is affected by this natural disaster\", it is possible to be open to international aid, but we have not yet come to the same place — . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Friday has been a second night in Palu since the earthquake and tsunami, and friends and family of those who have not been seen are still hoping that their loved ones will be among the miracles that bring some joy in this natural disaster.
Saturday is a little boy who lives in a container of contaminated water.
On Sunday, the rescuers took a woman in a damaged house for two days, along with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, an Indonesian national parapensive team trainer, trained two invisible parapenses for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others in the Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, are also members of the pressure.
\"My heart is heavy, as a lubricate in the parapente field,\" she says.
Mr. Gendon relates that a few hours after the news among the MPs that the Roa Hotel was destroyed, he quickly sent a number of messages through WhatsApp, who participated in a meeting on the coast.
The message he sent, however, is only a colored character, not two blue-colored characters.
\"I think they don't even get the message I sent,\" she says.
26.750 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On Friday morning, the British's staff took 26.750 dollars away from Newport's GAB to Levee, according to a press statement from Newport's Police Office.
The driver released the GAB in a hobby site and prepared to raise additional funds, says Det. Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was there, another man — running to the back of the Brink's employee — and stole the basket of money that was about to be offered there.
A number of people saw the witness withdraw from the site, as the statement stated, but the police did not explicitly state the number of people involved in the theft.
It is urged to call Newport police on 859-292-380 who have information about these people.
Kanye West: rap singer has changed her name to Ye
Rap Kanye West has changed its name to Ye.
On Saturday, he wrote about his change of name on Twitter: \"I am known by the official name of Kanye West\"
There was a time when 41-year-old West got the name Ye and it was the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
Before his visit to Saturday Night Live, which is supposed to produce his new album called Yandhi, this change is about to take place.
He is the foreigner to replace Ariana Grande's singer on the show, who suddenly left the team because of its responsibilities,” says the creator of the program.
West announced that it also includes the professional name he uses today and also has a religious meaning for him.
\"I think 'ye' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,' — said West at the beginning of the year, when speaking the title of his album to the Big Boy radio program host.
\"So it is I, and you, and us, that we are.
So it's from the Canye, which means it's the only one, and it's coming to Ye — nothing but good, bad, lost, all of us.
This music album has more insight into how we are affected —
He was one of several famous rap singers who changed names.
Sean Combs, for example, has been called Puff Dad, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
His colleague in the West, JAY-Z, was also there, who agreed that his name could always be kept, whether it was reliced or not, written or written.
AMLO in Mexico has vowed not to use soldiers to fight civilians
The newly elected Mexican President, Andrew Manuel Lopez Obrador, swore that it was his duty to use military forces to fight civilians, as blood was about the 50th anniversary of the student's protests.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Mr. Lopez Obrador promised to send a soldier to kill the Mexican people — . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
In fact, on October 2, 1968, the military shot peaceful protesters at the stadium, killing fewer than 300, during the time that the student movement on left power across Amérique Latine took root.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly supplies for those who are studying and also to open new government universities.
Unemployment and lack of access to education, he says, has attracted young people to corrupt organizations.
The U.S. should double the amount of funding for the I.A.
China is already progressing in the artificile intelligence sector (IA), so the United States should have twice as much money as it uses for research on this platform, says IA investor Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple companies.
That is how he noted when different departments of the U.S. Government made a statement about IA, even though the entire United States did not have an official policy for the IA.
More recently, China announced its order: it is aiming to be a priority in the reform of IA until 2030.
—It's good to start with twice the budget for IA research, as the United States is already much smaller than any other country, and we're waiting for the best new things for the IA,” Lee says.
When the money used is doubled, there may be twice as much of the energy that in the United States the next biggest change in the IA world will occur, Lee said during the CNN conference this week.
Mr. Lee, who wrote the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order — published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director of Innovation Ventures, who created one of the IA's first companies in China, Face++.
In 80 C.E., at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that won the best U.S. Othello player, and later was a senior employee at Microsoft Research and head of the Google service in China.
Lee admitted that the technology competition organized by the former American Government was good, such as Robotics Challenge at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and wondered when the next series was going to be, in order to identify the intellectuals to bring new things in the future.
Lee has often said that researchers in the United States need to work hard for the state's funds.
- But China is not the one who pulls the academic leaders out; it's the company,” Lee says.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology-focused companies have attracted different university stars to focus on the IA sector.
Change of immigration policy may also help the United States to speed up their efforts for the IA, says Lee.
\"I think those with Doctorat on IA should immediately be given a carte verte,\" she says.
In July 2017 the Chinese National Council released the new IA's development format.
The National Natural Science Foundation in China provides people with funding for education centers, similar to that given by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations for American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, says Lee.
In the early part of the year in the United States, the Ministry of Defense set up a joint institution for artificielle intelligence, which is intended to unite partners from industry and education, and Maison Blanche announced that the Committee is now being formed to focus on artificial intelligence.
The DARPA also announced this month of DARPA that it would spend 2 billion dollars on the event called AI Next.
For the NSF, there are now more than 100 million dollars for IA research.
On the other hand, no legal action in the United States has yet been made to establish the National Security Commission on Intelligence artificielle.
Macedonian voters are voting in a referendum on changing the country's names
On Sunday, voters in Macedonia would vote in a referendum to question whether the name of the country would be changed to be the Republic of North Macedonia — the country's name or not, a rule that would end the decade-old controversy with Greece, which prevented its plans to become a member of the European Union and the NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, continues to believe that the name of this neighboring country in the north is destroying its land, and that it continues to cross into NATO and the European Union.
The two regimes agreed with the new name of fraud in June, but some nationalists said that if the name was changed, it would be a force to attract large numbers of Slavs people in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote during the referendum and as a result of the occupation of refusing to participate in the campaign, the number of voters is expected to not understand the 50 percent required to gain power in the referendum.
The question will be raised at the referendum: : Do you agree to the presence of the NATO and the European Union by agreeing to the agreement with Greece? · Global Voices
Supporters of the naming change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said it would be better to accept as a price of joining groups such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born as a result of Yugoslavie's destruction.
\"I'm here today to vote for the country's future, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live in freedom under the European Union because it means a better life for all of us,\" says Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not specified by the law that it must be followed, the number of parliamentarians is enough to say that it will follow the results of the vote to make it change things immediately.
Two thirds of parliamentarians have to agree to the name change.
The national election committee said that up to 1 o’clock in the afternoon no reports said inconsistency.
However, no more than 16 percent of voters came to vote, while 34 percent voted during the 2016 final parliamentary elections, where 66 percent of the registered voters were registered as votes.
- I told my children that I was putting a vote, because we should be in Europe,” says 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
In Macedonia Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and Dushko, came to vote for a referendum on the change of country's name to open its entrance to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was in front of the parliament in Skopje, setting up a small platform and setting up a seat in front of the tent that was set up by the occupyers who refused to take part in the referendum.
\"We are willing to enter the NATO and the European Union, but we want to be honored instead of moving to the curriculum\" said Kavadarkov.
\"We are a poor country, but yet we have a poor one.
When our name is not appropriate for them, we can turn to China and Russia again, and we are members of the European and Asian Declaration Group —
The coming in of NATO will bring an urgent investment for Macedonia, says Prime Minister Zaev, as the unemployment rate is now well over 20 percent.
(I think most of the population will encourage this because more than 80 percent of the citizens are in favor of entering the European Union and the NATO,) said Mr. Zaev after voting.
The victory of the people — he says — will be as strong as our future as possible —
According to a typical survey published by the Supreme Institute for Political Research in Macedonia on Monday that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will be on the vote for the referendum - that is less than necessary.
Another simple study conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia found that 57 percent of the people questioned said they would vote on Sunday.
The 70 percent of those said they would vote — yes —
50 percent of voters with one vote are required to vote, which is only to be found to be a successful referendum.
While this referendum is about to collapse, it will be the first major defeat for the Western government policy since its reign in May last year.
Note: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has visited all the Brighton posts and killed the ball
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling hit Brighton's post as Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's transmission of football seems relatively easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a service from the center of the stadium first.
He crossed between the top three Brighton's post first, and then broke free.
Suddenly, four green players lined Aguero.
He first moved behind an outpost, then ran through the many outposts on the back of Brighton's border.
Then he pushed the ball to the left, and Sterling got it.
When the English fighter threw the first ball into the tree area, it was returned to Aguero, who had fired at the right hand and tricked Mathew Ryan, Brighton's champion, as the ball had entered the right corner of the net.
- Aguero's right foot has a small problem, - says Pep Guardiola, mayor of City, to the journalist.
We talked about only 55 or 60 minutes of playing.
This is what happened.
We were very lucky that he killed football at that time —
Sterling but gave Sky Blues the first benefit in this game for the Premier League.
He killed that ball in the 29th minute.
Aguero was then receiving services in Brighton's land.
It was a beautiful shot that he sent that ball to the left side of the court for Leroy Sane.
Sane took the ball forwards before he led Sterling to the long-term bust.
The football player is about to get out of the stadium, and the Sky Blues bomber is about to go into the net.
On Tuesday 12 hours and 55 p.m. City will deal with Hoffenheim in the group for the Champions League, in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Allemagne.
Scherzer's goal is to play at the Rockies meeting
There is no reason to be forced to play first, as the Nationals are no longer involved in the final process.
Scherzer, however, likes to compete so much that he thinks he's going to join the game on Sunday at the meeting with the Colorado Rockies, the only requirement is that the Rockies have an effect on the end of the game, as they have an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies gained the joker's position when the Nationals won 5-2 nights, but this has been the hope of getting the first festival.
- Even if we don't have anything to fight, at least we will encourage because we know that the air will not go away in Denver's games with the viewers and other teams that I'm sure will bring out the best in it, much more than I've seen this year.
How can I not be too quick to compete with it?
The Nationals have not yet been informed who will play Sunday first, but it seems that Scherzer would have decided to turn the ball if that was the case.
On Thursday, Scherzer became a real footballer, who was going to face the 34th game when it was done, and he would also be on Sunday even on a day of rest.
This right-right footballer in Washington has an 18-7-point score, and for this season it has an ERA 2.53 and a strikeout 300 in 220 2/3.
President Trump has gathered people in West Virginia
The President made a small deal about the situation surrounding Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, whom he chose to be appointed in the Supreme Court, in a discussion of the importance of the arrival of the electoral Republic during his future elections.
- All that we have done in November is high.
In the last five weeks, the election will be one of the most important in our lives.
This is one of the biggest, most important -- I don't fall for elections but in fact I'm falling for election, which is why I'm going all over the country fighting for these good candidates,” she says.
President Trump kept saying, \"You see these very bad Democratic groups, those who do what we say.
And they were ready to overthrow the power again in every way, whereby ye see the oppression and wickedness of the earth.
They don't care who he is, who he will have to get the power and control, which he needs, power and control, but we don't give them it to them — . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Democrats, he said, took a mission to oppose and prevent.
\"You saw what was done in those four days,\" he said, \"that the Devil is cruel, cruel, and evil, and doesn't tell the truth.
He made a special name for the Democratic Community of Dianne Feinstein at the Senate Law Commission, which was signed by the audience.
Do you remember the answers?
Have you published a document?
An, an, what?
No, mm, no, no one I've been waiting for — that's really wrong — it's the worst move I've ever seen ever since —
The Labour Party is no longer a free church.
He does not tolerate those who are timid by nature
It was no wonder that the Momentum party in our town was throwing stones to silence me.
In fact, I was the last parliament of Labour to say that my opinion was unnecessary — the reason is simple: I have been able to comment.
Nothing else has won Joan Ryan, my colleague's parliamentarian, because he could never be detained against the Jews' haters.
For me, it was my opposition to Jeremy Corbyn's opinion that I was the cause of the vote that criticized me.
It is about the importance of the economic policy of accountability, national security, about Europe, which is a joke that Jeremy was a subject of discussion with the former leader.
The document for the meeting of Nottingham East Labour stated on Friday: \"Let's get together for all to share and get out of it\"
During the more than eight years that Labour has been a parliament, the GC gathering has fully met these requirements every Friday night.
Sadly, though, the climate is not like that at many meetings, and it has long been forgotten, even if the political promises have been started — nicer and easier —
It became clear that the disagree was not accepted in the Labour party and people were judged as to whether the party leader would agree or not.
Shortly after becoming Jeremy's leader, I had a colleague with whom I thought I had a similar political view of me in the past began to wait for me to turn around and accept a view that I could not then accept — whether it was about national security or the common market in the European Union.
Every time I speak in public — no matter where I live — there has always been widespread criticism on social networks calling for the removal of my name, criticizing the policies of the central party, saying that I should not be in the Labour party.
And that doesn't happen to me alone.
I know well that it is easier to get me than to get some colleagues because my comments are political.
It seems to me to see the professional and persistent efforts of colleagues who face the same criticisms of men or women every day but never back.
One of the most frustrating features of our political era is seeing strong words like what has become popular.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should create a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer the once-free church, and the party is forced every time there is a vote — a trust vote — or a change in the rules of membership elections.
For the past two years, many have suggested that I walk slowly and without getting upset, so — no one is concerned about me —
But that's not what I've been looking for for politics.
Since I went to the Labour party 32 years ago while I was still a student, because I was upset by the government of Thatcher who allowed the school I was studying to be destroyed in the country, I have always fought to improve the public affairs provided for those in particular - whether the city advisors or the government minister.
I haven't yet hidden my politics, including it during the final election.
No one in Nottingham East can say that my political opinion and what I didn’t think of the leader was not clear.
One thing I want to say to those who encouraged the Friday vote, when we see the country pushing towards Brexit that will have a bad effect on many houses, businesses and public affairs, I don't know what it takes to waste time and dust in order to support the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, my message is not for Nottingham Momentum but for the people I'm recruiting, whether members of the Labour party or not: I'm happy to be able to serve you and I promise that there will be no threat to the ban or political abuse that will prevent me from taking the conditions I believe are most useful for all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is raised on top, which has never been lost
The latest results may have been a couple of attempts, but no doubt the victory won by Tennent for the Premiership's first game this day, which was so impressive.
They are now on top, as they are the only team they won't lose at least once.
In fact, the team won the victory, with Peter Murchie being the most just to be happy, is the strength of his defense and his ability to take advantage of the situation.
- We’re always in prison, but no one has won us, so I have to be happy,” she says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: \"Happy are Ayrs, because they have been able to take advantage of our team--
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson, confirmed by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but Rory Hughes, the Scottish captain, who was released by the Warriors, was able to take advantage of the lack of numbers so that Jason Baggot was arrested for an endless test.
Climo had a penalty of Ayr's profit, and then, ahead of the break, he killed his own ball and increased it by 17-5 the Ayr's lead in the middle.
But the second part for Melrose was well started and after Patrick Anderson's trial, confirmed by Baggot, was reduced to five more times.
Then there was a long pause for Ruaridh Knott’s severe injuries, which had to be held out of the stadium, and once the game was returned, Ayr resurfaced through the trial by Stafford McDowall, confirmed by Climo.
It was where Blair Macpherson, a temporary captain for Ayr, received a yellow card, and Melrose again exploited the number of players he had so far that Bruce Colvine was able to try despite the provocation, after a short struggle.
However, the mayor returned, so after Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he dropped Climo that didn't carry a ball, from the penalty sign, MacPherson went to the back of the football line, from behind the Ayr's back.
Climo chose a truce, as he did after the game returned, when Kyle Rowe opened David Armstrong's line and offered Gregor Henry, a side-by-sider, offer to kill the city team's fifth trial.
Still Game star seems to be ready to start a new job in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, a player at Still Game, seemed willing to start a new job in the hospitality industry, when he was known to be the director of a company that had been allowed to build a restaurant.
She is now 56 years old, and plays Jack Jarvis's role in the famous BBC show, where she wrote and played with Greg Hemphill, her old best friend.
The two said that the ninth party would be the end of the program, and in the sight of Kirnan was preparing life after Craiglang.
According to official documents, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not answer the question about the news, but there was a source of information in the Scottish Sun that Kiernan was planning to enter the focal point of the restaurant — in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivie, who has no coast, hopes that the court will again open the way to the Pacific mainland
La Paz's main naval office is a ship with a cargo-bound port.
State office is playing a blue flag like the sea.
The naval camp at Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is full of slogans like this: #We have the sea.
We're trying to get it again
The commemoration of the loss of Chile’s past coast during a bloodbath in the 19th century was still an impressive all over Bolivie, and the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean is not less than that.
That hope is probably not as alive today as it was ten years ago, as Bolivie is now waiting for an international court order to be issued on October 1, when they have been suspended for five years.
\"Bolivie took a good load, was united and calm, and was hopeful of what the outcome would be,\" says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diploma.
Many Bolivians will follow the release of the international TV court (ICJ) across the country, hoping that Bolivia’s request will be accepted by the court in La Haye, but - after decades of discussion — Chile will have to discuss how to give Bolivie a way to the sea.
Evo Morales, the white president of Bolivie, is also looking forward to much of the judgment that will come on Monday - which is facing a hard fight to vote for the second time of the coming year.
\"The time is near for us to return to the Pacific Ocean,\" he promises at the end of August.
Some investigators, however, think that the court isn't sure to judge Bolivae - and even if it makes justice, there will be little change.
The United Nations service working in Pays-Bas has no power to give a portion of Chile's land to others, and he has said that he can't claim to be the last word as a result of any possible discussion.
The view that only six months after the opening of a clause is issued by the international court (ICJ) is suspected that the case has not been interfered - the case, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Four years ago, Bolivie’s demands would not be met, but they would be further reversed.
—The Bolivian government has now seized the road to the sea,” Zárate says.
Morales ’ aggressive approach may have made the little agreement left in Chile a waste, he says.
Both Bolivie and Chili would have to go back to a discussion, but it would be difficult to discuss the matter after this incident.
Since 1962, both countries have not entered the embassy.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivie in La Haye, denied that the court’s release this time was too fast.
It's Monday that will take — a good way to open a new connection with Chile — to Bolivie, he says, and a time to use — to break the breach that lasts 139 years in a healthy way of one's own and one's own--
Calzadilla also denied the claim that Morales — who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — used the sea issue as a political step forward.
\"Bolivie will never free her right to get a way to the Pacific National Park,\" she says.
- This law goes out, lets us see what we need to do to get back to the past.
North Korea will never destroy nuclear weapons if it can't trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said they would never destroy the first nuclear weapon if he could not trust Washington.
On Saturday, Mr. Ri spoke in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promise made at Singapore's top meeting with the president of these rival countries.
This is how he noted if the U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo was about to reopen a nuclear diploma that appeared to have erupted more than three months after the Singapore meeting with Kim Jong Un, North Korea's leader.
Ri stated that the idea that the United States' punishment and opposition to the statement that the Korean War ended would bring North Korea to its knees.
However, it is a warning for Washington to accept the statement but Pyongyang is not taking a significant step toward disarmament.
Neither Kim nor US President Donald Trump wanted to hold a second high meeting.
But many do not believe that Pyongyang is really ready to throw away the weapons that the country is sure to take for security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang in the upper month to prepare the second top meeting with Mr. Kim and Trump.
In Paris fashion exhibitions have seen the most new product of the giant head beauty that will soon come to your top-level vendors near you
Don't be far away if you want to contribute to the number of hats you make or to stop the sun completely from taking you.
Valentino and Thom Browne’s fashion creators have introduced a series of head decorations, which are both ugly and great to include in a series called SS19, on the stage of the contest that made the Paris Fashion Week quite bright.
These barely available hats have gone around Instagram this summer, and the fashion creators have sent these paintings to the fashions that speak their dumb hats.
Valentino, for example, was a very pale brown hat, with large feathers like a bird’s hair covering the head of the dancer.
Among the great charms found there were stone-covered prisoners, machinist masks, and there have been so far - but they were not intended to fire our heads.
There are also a number of strange masks shown by Thom Browne — very good time for Halloween.
Most of these masks are almost naked, and they don't seem to look like Hannibal Lecter.
They created an example similar to that of a chemical device, including air and surveillance channels, and the other similar to a snowhouse that was eaten but blown up.
And if you continue to make a show, you have something to do.
Monitors estimate that these giant hats may be on the top of your favorite fashion vendors.
On the feet of 'La Bomba', both Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski have made a half-meter-sized straw hat.
Another great creative work was shown by this most well-known character, who created these barely available hats — a fetty collection on the beach, made of dry grass and needed to be as large as the swimmer wearing a heavy swimming coat.
This dark-haired rofia box, with a furry fur coat of skin, is the most prominent creative work in the Jacquemus results in the SS19 La Riviera series shown during the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a fashion creator for celebrities, says in FEMAIL: 'I am aware that the big hats and a collection on the coast of the next spring are going to be on top of the top of the top of the country’s beach — the designer’s creation is so complex that it would be difficult to go home to the demands of people to have a great harvest.'
John Edward: The people of the world really need foreign language skills
The independent schools in Scotland are famous for producing perfect results, and this continued in 2018 as the results were excellent, and the success of the private and team in sports, art, music and other common activities increased.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are also trying hard at these schools, which are replaced by the Council of private schools (SCIS) to provide their students and parents with the best education opportunities.
The goal of the independent school is to support its students for higher and deeper education, their work of oversight and the place of world citizenship.
Since the educational sector can design and implement a program for each school, we now see that modern language is still one of the most popular and popular subjects in school.
Nelson Mandela says: \"When you talk to someone in one of their language, your words come to his head.
When thou speakest to him in his slow words, thy words come into their heart;
It's a sobering reminder that we can't just live in English if we want to create relationships and trust with people from other countries
As we look at the final results for this year, it appears that foreign language leads to the best-taken subjects available to students of private schools.
In Australia 68 percent of foreign-language students have received less than 19/20.
This data, found by 74 SCIS schools, shows that 72 percent of students received 19/20 in Mandarin, when 72 percent of Allemand students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students got 19/20.
This shows that foreign language education is supported by independent schools in Scotland because of the ability to take care of children and young people later on.
Now the foreign language, as a choice subject, is as attractive as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private and other schools programs.
A 2014 study conducted by the Community Committee in Royaume-Uni for work and skills found that in view of why the users said it was difficult to introduce their needs, 17 percent was due to the lack of foreign speakers.
Thus, foreign language becomes an ever - increasing challenge if young people want to prepare to face the task that they would later want to pursue.
This skill is vital in the world that lives in the development world, as the number of jobs that require foreign language skills continues to increase.
No matter what a person’s job is, if he learns a foreign language, he will benefit greatly from the future because it can be used in his later life.
People who speak a number of indigenous languages will always benefit from their competitors because they can communicate directly with foreigners.
According to a simple survey by YouGov of 4,000 adults in Royaume-Uni in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign in order to have a simple conversation, and only French was the only foreign language of 15 percent of them.
This is how important it is to raise money to improve foreign language education today, for ankehitrio children.
Those who speak a number of indigenous languages, especially the language of developing countries, will benefit from finding suitable employment for their lives.
Every school in Scotland will be unique in the language they teach.
A number of schools will focus on teaching modern languages, but some will teach what is considered to be the most important language for Royaume-Uni while looking at 2020, such as Mandarin or Jabonais.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there are a number of foreign languages that can always be selected in private schools, and the teacher in charge is an expert.
The independent school in Scotland is willing to focus on creating a learning environment to prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what happens in the future.
The foreign language cannot be denied right now, in the development business world, but the country’s future is still dependent on the importance of the foreign language, so it must be reflected in education.
It is true that the foreign language should be accepted — exactly what international communications require —
Private schools will always continue to offer choices, differences and perfect practices for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Independent School Council
LeBron will play first on Lakers in San Diego today
The wait for fans who want to see LeBron James to play first in Los Angeles Lakers will soon end.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James would play on Sunday during the first game for the pre-game period, to live with Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is still not known how many minutes he will play.
\"There must be more than one and less than 48,\" says Walton at the official website of Lakers.
Lakers' personal journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James' play time may be limited.
Journalist James asked him about what to do during the six games that Lakers will play before the legal event, after training for the beginning of this week.
- I don’t need a game to prepare for the legal event until I'm ready for this degree in my career,” she says.
An Ata Trump rally in West Virginia, Chaîne YouTube
In Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is starting a number of rallies tonight.
This is the first rally of five President Trump's plans for this coming week, including a small break in nearby cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
When it was confirmed that his decision to fill the gap in the Supreme Court was suspended first, President Trump called on people to support our close-up elections because the control of Congress could be released in the hands of the Republic after the November vote ended.
How many public meetings are held by President Trump tonight in West Virginia and how is it possible to follow him online?
President Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is 7 p.m. tonight, September 29, 2018.
You can directly follow President Trump's rally in West via YouTube.
Trump may speak of his appeal to Mr. Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to attend the Supreme Court, which has become tense about the charges of engaging in a criminal act and is expected to have a week-long detention of the Senate's conviction until the FBI's investigation is over.
But the main reason for the rally was to help the Republicans get a small deal to face the November elections.
Thus, the organizers of President Trump's propaganda said that the five rallies will be held during the above week are to be encouraged by volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to maintain and expand the population in the Assembly of the People's House and Public Court,” the Reuters said.
—The importance of his program is so great that the President will choose to travel to various states as he is caught before entering the era of mass propaganda,” said the spokesman for President Trump's propaganda organizer, who was anonymous when speaking to Reuters.
On Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling the rally is scheduled tonight, which could attract supporters from \"Ohio and Pennsylvania and help journalists from Pittsburgh,\" says West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday was the second day that Mr. Trump visited West Virginia in the past month, the state in which he won over 40 percent of the number in 2016.
Trump's goal is to help Mr. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the People in West Virginia, which is a matter of simple investigation.
- It's not very good for Mr. Morrisey to see the president who has to try to encourage him to increase his numbers in the polls,” says Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown that he has the energy to fight not to break when facing a special war on Sunday.
After these three games, Ryder Cup will probably be running this four-person game on Saturday afternoon.
The claim that sports games are a great game, but players, especially in such competitions, are a very simple concept.
So who would be left alone if they were asked?
- They had six benefits, but now the remaining four, it might be said that we got a little material now,” said Jordan Spieth before starting the day with a small race.
Of course, Europe has benefits, leading to four numbers and still has twelve more to fight.
The Americans, according to Spieth, seem to feel that there is a little breeze to help their ships and that they have many reasons for encouragement, particularly the strength of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played all day and got three of the four.
Spieth's play from the green tape is really devastating and shows a good example to follow.
His musical voice continued to grow as his role went forward, killing a significant putt and holding a clear victory in the fourth game so that both Thomas and Thomas were no more than two after the two rounds.
He immediately shouted for the putt they had won at the 15th pit victory, the kind of claim that the American team hasn't fallen.
- It’s very important to have perseverance and not concentrate except on your games alone,” says Spieth.
The two players now have the rest.
He has 18 flowers to sing his name.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players with more numbers than Spieth and Thomas for two days, which is the undisputable story of Ryder Cup.
They have four numbers in the four games that appear to be inconspicuous but beautiful from Europe, and they don't seem to make mistakes anymore.
-Moliwood — the only two people who didn't shoot a bog on Saturday afternoon, but they also left the booze on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the Friday morning back.
This long-term effort, with the sight of their energy coming down from these proud spectators, seems to confirm that they are the players who need to lose on Sunday, and no fans of Fleetwood or Molinari can win for the European when the Le Golf National is home.
For the better they hold it together but with different pits.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Sergio Garcia, the king of the fourballs, was dying in the morning by Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson, while he was with Alex Noren.
A bog and double in the middle of the front were thrown down by the Espagnol and the Swedish in a hole he didn't get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one can expect to pull you out of the pit.
It's very interesting to watch the fourballs and foursomes close together because of the cooperation between the two players, the advice they give, the advice they don't talk about and the possible change of the strategy in the face.
So far the European team has been playing well and they have a significant advantage when it comes to the last day but it is also found in this foursome game that the team of the USA has the energy to pull against the Team despite the suspects, including those in the United States.
Europe leads 10-6 to the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has the advantage of entering the last day of the Ryder Cup when it defeated the United States in 10-6 after the fourballs and foursomes game last Saturday.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, a constant co-founder of information, led by a double victory over the busy Tiger Woods, raising a total of four to Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn, which aims to hold their hand-on-breaking free collection in Hazeltine two years ago, the American who refused to be fined during the fourballs, led by 3-1 in the series.
The Americans reacted more strongly during the foursomes, winning both games, but they were unable to reduce their efficiency.
If Jim Furyk's team wants to hold his collection, it needs eight times during the 12 private games on Sunday.
Fleetwood was the first European amateur to have four consecutive numbers, while he and Molonari were alone, called \"Molliwood\" after the weekend of the surprise of many, the second pair of four in the four opening games in Ryder Cup's history.
When they met Woods and Patrick Reed with the fourballs, they pointed out in a beautiful way to win the handy Woods and the new American Bryson Dechambeau in numbers, making 5&4 more impressive.
Woods, which was so popular during the two games, sometimes seemed to shine suddenly but it was already a fourballs and a 19 foursomes game in 29 who had defeated him and he had been defeated seven times.
When Justin Rose came to life for the fourballs in the morning, he would return with Henrik Stenson during the foursomes and win 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka — the first and third number of the world.
It was not all right for Europe to do, though it was a pleasant and windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who had received the three-thirds of the show, set the standards for Americans when Saturday was two.
They were able to win 2&1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Espagne in the fourballs and they returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 in the foursosomes even though he broke the first two holes.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history, a team was released from four defeats at the start of the game, even though Furyk's team had enough to hold its game.
Although they have held the second place for two days, they do not seem to be able to bear the results of the war that will appear on Sunday.
'Cause North Korea is supposed to destroy its weapons alone without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister announced on Saturday in front of the United Nations that if the punishment continues, his trust in the United States will quickly diminish and that it is because the country is willing to give up its nuclear weapons only if that is the case.
Mr. Ri Yong Ho announced in front of the annual Assembly that North Korea has already taken up a huge deal of self-sufficiency - in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, destroying nuclear testing sites, and promising not to distribute nuclear weapons and technology.
- But we didn’t see what he was dealing with from the United States,” she says.
\"If we can't trust the United States, we will never be confident about protecting our country, so that's the case because we decide on our own to destroy our first weapons--
Even though Mr. Ri repeated the North Koera's complaints about Washington's opposition to the practice — taking steps — to eliminate nuclear weapons that would be rewarded North Korea every time he managed a step, his declaration seemed remarkable because he did not reject the disarming of uncontrollable nuclear weapons, as Pyongyang used to do.
Mr. Ri reviewed the statement made by Mr. Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first high-ranking meeting between American Presidents and North Korean Leaders in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to try to achieve the — the removal of the nuclear weapon between the Korean Ocean — President Trump promised to guarantee the protection of North Korea.
North Korea sought an official way to end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States stated that Pyongyang had to first agree to quit nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused the call to free the global image of North Korea.
- The United States continues to push forward for the first - disarming of nuclear weapons — and will intensify the pressure that the punishments bring to achieve their goals in the oppression, as well as opposition to the war - a declaration of ceasefire,” says Ri.
- The thought that the punishment will make us deaf means that we are unaware of ourselves.
The only problem is that as these sanctions continue, our distrust grows -
Mr. Ri hasn't put the order on the second summit between Mr. Kim and Trump as the U.S. President pointed out before the United Nations in the beginning of the week.
What the Minister brought out was the three-time meeting between Mr. Kim and South Korea President Moon Jae-in for five months, and he added: \"If South Korea is not discussed in this nuclear disarmament, the nuclear disarmament in Korea will not be as intense as the nuclear disarmament against the Korean Sacanos —
However, Mr. Ri’s response to his speech was quite different in comparison with last year, when he said in front of the United Nations General Assembly that the U.S. pursuit of fuses from North Korea was no longer inevitable after the call of the \"Unusual Pharoha\" of Mr. Kim to \"home-fusée\" — who was acting as a suicide mission.
While President Trump was facing the United Nations this year, he warned that — the total collapse — of North Korea last year, he warmly commended Mr. Kim for taking measures to destroy the weapons, but he said that there was still a lot of work to wait and that the punishment would not be fined until North Korea lost its nuclear weapons.
Trump said last Wednesday he doesn't have a clear date to accomplish it, but he said \"It takes about two years, three years or five months for it to be done — it doesn't matter--
China and Russie have announced that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its process.
However, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced in front of the United Nations Security Council that Thursday: \"The application of the sanctions issued by the Security Council will have to be strictly and without delay until we are able to complete, complete, and justified nuclear weapons\"
The Security Council has been able to raise sanctions for North Korea since 2006 to try to limit funding for Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missiles.
During the United Nations Assembly, Mr. Pompeo met Mr. Ri and later said he would visit Pyongyang again in the upper month to prepare for the second high meeting.
Mr. Pompeo had visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not very good.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said the discussion went on, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of making — a crime-like request —
When North Koreans met with Mr. Moon this month, they said that the United States would destroy a missile factory and nuclear storage center if the United States was receiving a similar feature —
Mr. Kim told him that \"the corresponding property\" is the security security security security that Mr. Trump promised in Singapore and the conditions for reconnecting with Washington.
Harvard students are learning about getting enough rest
In the new lesson offered to high school entrepreneurs at Harvard University this year, students increase their sleep to try to combat the culture of self-suffering as a result of the ‘night' education by caffeine.
One researcher found that students at this world’s perfect university often do not really know what the most basic measures they should make for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep therapy at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed this lesson, which is believed to have never been the same in the United States.
It was interesting for him to create the lesson after he spoke about the impact of sleep deprivation on the learning process.
'After the interview a girl came up and said, 'Why did anyone say that to me, already in the third year?'
No one ever told him how important sleep is — and it’s amazing,” he said in The Telegraph.
In this lesson, which was first started this year, the students are explained to the students the basic knowledge of good sleep habits that contribute to learning and sports performance, and that improves overall life.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university’s health agency, announced that the university decided to include the lesson when it became evident that students had very little sleep during the week.
An hour - long study involves motivating one another to discuss each other’s encouraging experiences.
In part, the students have a picture of the students, and the students need to paint pictures of coffee coffee, windowcloths, trainers and books and inform them of the effects of caffeine and light and the effects of sleep deprivation on sports, and eventually the importance of sleep habits.
On the other hand, participants have been told that long-term sleep deprivation may lead to a drop in the way, a drop in the path, a depression, and cancer.
Then there is a school map, a small icon with links, encouraging participants to consider their daily routine.
'We know that this will not change the lives of students
But we believe that they have the right to know that — nothing else than your right to know the effects of smoking on health,” Professor Czeisler says.
The proud habit is still present when ‘sleeping all night,’ he says, and adds that because of modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep loss has become an ongoing problem.
Making sure that the body is sufficient, and good sleep, should be a 'secret weapon' that students should use to fight stress, get tired and rest, he says — yes, even when the waist is not getting together, because lack of sleep tells the brain that it is hungry, so it becomes hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old youth from Californie who studied chemistry and music, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the lesson, as he had attended a lesson to him last year at Harvard.
This lesson opened her eyes and encouraged her to give the lesson to the entire classroom.
He hopes that the next step is to send the fourth-year-old student up to complete a similar education program before entering the competition platform.
Professor Czeisler suggests that students should make an alarm for sleep time and waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘ blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can cause serious disturbances of sleep and physical activity, which can cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gerrard's people are killed by Menga's ball
The Rangers suffered from a relapse and only resulted in a 1-0 defeat of Steven Gerrard's team who seemed too ill to play in Livingstone, as a result of Dolly Menga's race.
The Ibrax team hoped to win the first victory outside the city since the 4-1 greatest victory in St. Johnstone in September, but the Gary Holt team of Gerrard presented the second defeat in the 18th game in which the administration was held, so his team in front of the Hearts team, the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership, was made eight times more numerous.
Seven minutes before the break, Menga killed a football, and the Rangers team at the stadium never seemed to have any idea of getting up.
Rangers have now moved to the sixth place, Livingston has gone up to the third place and Hibernian is the only front of the dead railway.
And the threat to the Rangers may not remain there after the injury received from the head of Calum Spence, a player on the other side of the court, if anything was made from outside the court and he had to be treated first.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, which passed through Ayr and joined the half-way route for the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, did not change the 11 Livi's number from Hearts last week and he would have been very happy to see his team that has been a good design to keep the opponent moving every time.
The Rangers may have occupied the ball, but Livingstone had the ability to make good use of the ball that had passed through it.
They should have been killed two minutes after the game began, as Menga made its first service and found Scott Pittman next to Allan McGregor's castle, but the ball that the middle player had lost in the stadium was far away.
Keaghan Jacobs then pulled a coup-franc from a distance and saw the sister-in-law Craig Halkett but the tie of his friend Alan Lithgow hung on a distant carpet.
Rangers were able to control the game, but their performance in the last third period seemed to be more hopeful.
Alfredo Morelos was strongly convinced that he should get a penalty if he and Steven Lawless had a strike in the forty-fiveth minute, but Judge Steven Thomson simply broke the Colombian and their complaints.
There were only two shots in front of Rangers' first term but there was little danger to Liam Kelly, a former barkeeper of the Iberox, who saw the services from the back of Lassana Coulibali and the sweet scars from Ovie Ejaria.
It may be true that Livi's first football wasn't the result of a good game being installed in the 34th minute, but everyone would agree that it was worth it just because of his creative ability.
Rangers were not able to cope with Jacobs' televised TV channel.
Scott Arfield was stunned when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, but it did not waver when he searched for Menga, who just killed the ball.
Ryan Kent changed a little thing while instead of replacing Coulibary, and it was about to be replaced by players because Morelos was sitting on the side of the stadium, but the big Kelly suddenly ran from his place and came to block him.
Livingston continued to pull these foreign teams to the game he loved most, and the raid from Lithgow and Halkett did not stop.
Holt's team was only able to add its number in the last minute but McGregor's stand was good enough to stop Jacobs, before the football went from the head of Lithgow to the edge of the tree.
Glenn Middleton, Rangers' successor, also asked for a penalty when he was separated from Jacobs, but Thomson did not even turn his attention.
Alimaika: Geiger Counter's creator · Global Voices
So look again at the page from our Alimanaka — Sunday Maraina: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, and THE MITOHY... The day was born in Allemagne, Johannes Wilhelm —Hans — Geiger, who would later become a musician.
Geiger developed radioactivity methods, and what he later created created created was the device called Geiger Counter.
The Geiger Counter has since become a scientific tool, and then has become a tool of pop culture, as seen in the film titled \"Bells of Coronado\" in 1950, with unexpected cowboys as scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: - What is it? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Rogers: - It is the Geiger Counter, used in the past to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you apply these listenings, you really hear the effects of radioactivity in the rock--
Evans: - Oh, he's really whispering now!
It was 1945 that she lost her life in her last year of life — Hans — Geiger, just a few days before the fall of the 3rd year of her life.
But there is still the object created by its name.
His new reading for cancer can teach the ‘seeing' security force of the patient cell
His new reading for cancer can teach the ‘seeing' security forces that are sick cells and kill them
His reading teaches in the medical process that the immune system is sensitive to the immune system.
This practice involves drawing cells from the patient, changing them in the basement.
They then complete a protéine that is common in many types of cancers, and then reintroduced into the body.
There was an attempt to find a positive outcome for a number of cancer patients.
When a woman was treated with her reading, she read to teach the protective power of the patient’s cell, and the cancers of the womb had suffered for more than 18 months.
In the process, healthy cells are removed from the patient, transplanted into the skeleton to be (see) the protéine called HER2 a combination of cancers, and then the cells are added to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says: \"If we see the results we have, this vaccine is very bright -
HER2 is the control of the rise of many types of cancers, including breast cancer, wombs, lungs and intestines, explains Professor Berzofsky.
There is a similar practice in which healthy cells in the patient are drawn — taught — to target cancer wards, which have resulted in a certain type of leucémie treatment.
Kanye West has given a long speech in support of Trump, and wears MAGA hats, following her visit to the SNL.
It has a bad end
The audience posted Kanye West in a video recording room during the Saturday Night Live program after American President Donald Trump gave a long speeches to congratulate the US and said he would vote in 2020.
When he finished his third song for the night, titled Ghost Town, which he sang in the making of a small hat Make America Great, he made a long speech criticizing the Democrat and retelling his support for Trump.
- I’m talking to the whites very often, and they say: \"How do you like Trump, a racist person?
If racism is a problem for me, I've been leaving America a long time ago,” she says.
To start the SNL program there was a brief story of Matt Damon, a Hollywood star, depicting Mr. Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's Law Commission, about the Russian charges of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not published during the program, it was the joker Chris Rock who published a photo album containing West's long speeches on social networks.
It is not clear that the goal of Rock is to laugh at West when he publishes that video.
West also complained to the audience that he was too busy behind the platform because of his hat.
- They beat me behind the platform.
They say, 'don’t make that hat when out there.'
They tortured me!
And they say that my place is difficult now,” he says, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
West kept saying: \"You want to see this difficult place a-and he said--I'm going to do Superman's dress, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Trying to love -
At least two times the audience was moved by what he said and it seems that SNL's hosts are ashamed, notes Variety, and one person told the newspaper: \"One house didn't say a word--
Mac Miller, the former rap singer who died a few days earlier, was invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande.
The way West sang the song, Love It, and dressed like the Perrier bottle, fascinated people.
West received the support of the TPUSA team officer, Candace Turner, who said to Tweeter: \"To the most brave of the brave: YOU'RE DOING TO USE THE PROPHETS\"
But Karen Hunter, a talk-show host, also told the Tweeter, which is what it is for West that he is doing so much good -
- I chose NOT to support people (to buy their clothes or songs, or to support their — art — I found that I was talking and commenting, which I thought was damaging to society.
He can do what he wants.
We too, she says.
The raper, prior to the show, said on Twitter that he had changed his name so - that he was known by the official name Kanye West -.
He was not the first artist to change his name, but he followed the way of Diddy, who is known as Puff Daddy, or Puffy and P Diddy
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, again took the name Snoop Lion, and the famous artist Prince also changed his name to make it famous.
Someone accused of killing people near Belfast restaurant
On Friday, a man was taken to the east of Belfast restaurant, where a 45-year-old man was accused of killing him.
It happened in Ballyhackmore, says the police.
The man will go to court in Belfast on Monday.
The case will be considered by the public ministry.
Kit Toriton, the famous actor of the Game of Thrones, in his adulthood
Jon Snow is what people will really know about Kit Toriton, using a sword in the ongoing Game of Thrones, which was a history of the day of violence.
The 31-year-old actor showed that a courageous person is not a tactless person, he said that this is why young men think he needs to be violent and strong before people respect him.
Kit said in the Sunday Times Culture that \"there is something wrong with it\" he wondered how to help men avoid the destructive attitude that had developed during the #MeToo period.
Kit recently married Rose Leslie, a woman who was playing with him in a 31-year-old Game of Thrones film, who said that she was — really ready — to help solve the problem.
‘I wonder why we have become the wrong way of thinking about men?’ he said.
‘What were boys taught when they grew up, causing this problem we see?'
Kit believes that television is one of the reasons people have a wrong idea about men when they look at the role of men in the movies.
He continued: ‘What are men like, and what are they taught?
What is taught on TV, and boys on the street see that they have to do so if they want to become real men?
Perhaps this is one of the most important questions we should answer: How to change it?
But there is a real problem with men.'
In the interview he said that when the Game of Throne ended the next summer, he would no longer play to make a break or a little more, but he was able to say ‘war and horse exchange'.
Kit will start playing a new movie next November, Sam Shepard's True West, which talks about a man who was a thief and his brother.
She said that her meeting with her husband, Rose, was one of the best things she had ever played in the Game of Thrones.
‘In this movie I saw my husband, that's why I got a family and started my life,’ he said.
Rose, Kit's interested woman, played the role of Ygritte when she played the role of Jon Snow during Emmy award-winning.
They were married in the country of Leslie's family in Scotland this June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: 14% of people said to be infected with the disease in China · Global Voices
China says 14% of the population with HIV virus AIDS has increased.
More than 8200,000 people are infected in the country, the health authorities say.
It's only in May to July of 2018 that some 40,000 people are reported to have been infected.
Most of them were sexually transmitted by the disease, but never before.
Blood exposure was the most frequent cause of the disease in some parts of China, before.
However, HIV victims are almost gone because of blood transfusions, says health officials in China, at a meeting in Yunnan.
Within the year, however, there have been 100,000 people with HIV and AIDS in China
The spread of HIV for sex is a major problem between men and women who are united with women in China.
Sex between men and women has also been legally recognized in China since 1997, but these types of people have been widely discriminated against ever since.
Because of the culture in the country, a survey found that only 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men are married.
It is not enough to protect their sexual relations, so that is why the disease is spread.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has approved the use of HIV injections from other countries to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the GOP's staff has not issued the secret of the senator and says that there is a real-doubt-to-one lie-
American Maxine Waters, said on Saturday that the people working with him had been falsely accused of publishing the secrets of the republican American senators on the Wikipédia page of the lawmakers.
The democracy in Los Angeles also confirms that right-wing people and websites that are breaking up their own ideas - have published these secrets.
This is a lie, a lie and a terrible lie,” said Waters, on what was shared on Twitter.
The special address and phone number in the United States are said to be included in these items.Landsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The special information was released on Thursday, and the person who sent it was unknown, but it was known that it took place during the senator's meeting at Capitol Hill.
The explanations were released shortly after Kavanaugh's three senators were interviewed.
Websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState say the IP address to which the message was sent was from the Waters office, and published information about the Water workers, says The Hill.
- This is unproven and completely false, says Waters.
- The person working with me - whose identity was hidden after these looks - has never published information.
There is no evidence and it's a complete lie--
What he said, especially Maison Blanche's journalist, and Fleischer, has caused more people on the Internet to criticize Waters.
\"His refusal is suspicious,\" says Fleischer.
- He has no qualities necessary to be a member of the Congress.
A person should not be angry if he is being beaten but he has not done it.
They should not be harsh.
He should not be suspicious of the reason why the person accuses him.
He should be peaceful and calm -
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of the Kavanaugh case, and his criticism because he was shown to be very angry on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a voter from the Republican party who aims to highlight Waters' place in the election, also commented on Twitter.
\"If it is true,\" he says
Rtoa Waters said that the authorities and the authorities in charge of the enforcement of the law were notified because of these accusations — their offices.
- We're making it possible to find the prosecutors — he said — and that they will be punished by the law for the evil they spread about the people who work with me —
Johnny English is back - The funny film of a spy Rowan Atkinson is playing
It has become common for people to think that there is always a distorted view of Brexit, which is the same as that of Johnny English- who was first released in 2003, titled Johnny English, and the title published in 2011 titled Johnny English Reborn.
Will we just laugh if people really talk about us and get us involved in trafficking?
In any case, we know that Johnny English, who is both illiterate and amusing, has renewed his commitment to the work.
He is an incompetent spy, and considers himself to be very beautiful, but some will come from Clouteau, and some will see him as Mr. Bean, something special about the Chariot du feu banner that was sung at the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
This player's role was taken from the film about Atkinson, who is a traveller around the world. This film was originally sent to Barclaycards TV, but is now unknown to people.
There is one or two good things for this JE to come out soon.
I would like to see Johnny English approaching the helicopter and wearing an old military coat, and the helicopter's object hit his helmet.
Even the appearance of Atkinson is funny, but it is not funny and it seems that the film was forced just to make fun, even if the film was actually a joke - serious - like 007 and the Mission is impossible.
It seems to be intended to make fun of children rather than adults.I think her role as Johnny English isn't much better than her funny movies.
But from the point of view, Grande-Bretegne has a serious problem.
Some Internet spies have used people to find the British network, so that they know who were the British spies, who discouraged the police who worked at the time — a small part played by Kevin Eldon.
This led to a lot of stories for the public prime minister who was well-known and problematic, but no support was available. Emma Thompson tried to do what she could when she played Teresa May, but she did not do anything.
Her counselor informed her that all their spies were already known, so she had to get an inactive spy.
It was intended to make Johnny English proud, who became a teacher in a financial school, and to train him to be a spy: funny story, because English has made him like a curious school.
English was once taken to Whitehall and found a former friend, Bough, who was played by Ben Miller.
Bough has married and works for people in the sea, which is a woman who shows herself to be respectful: a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Batman and Robin therefore go back to work together, and do wrong when they persecute the Queen's Champions, and meet Opelia Bulletova, the game of Olga Kurylenko, who is a beautiful and powerful young woman.
At the same time, however, the prime minister was deceived when a man seemed so wealthy and able to solve the problem of the Internet spy. This is none but Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
The course of English and Bough will begin, and they have dressed food transporters in hotels, burning French hotels, and they have found a problem when they went to the Volta ship. And English has created a problem when learning to use a casque to visualize Volta's house.
We will still see in the next half of the story, even though it is fun and funny, there is a TV program for children to do so.
Let's just be balanced.
When I saw this film Johnny English just to come out, I thought: English should give him a role to make his real identity available when playing a movie.
The workers refused to put up a war hammer for four days a week to work for the British and to receive a five-day wage.
Jeremy Corbyn's party plans to carry out the project that will allow the British to work four days a week while receiving five days ’ wages.
The union said that employers should transfer the funds stored for technology development to give them extra days.
It will take three days off at the end of the week but it is paid.
The source says the idea will fit well with the context's plan to benefit workers.
The Committee's Congress agreed to allow workers to work only four days a week so that they could benefit from economic changes.
A longtime member of the Labor Union of The Sunday Times said: \"The new management statement is expected before the end of the year.
‘It doesn’t work for night workers but the demand is good, only four days of the week will work, or it will benefit employees and industrial stratagems according to the context.’
Not only did the Union of Workers have this opinion, the Green Party also promised to work only four days a week during its 2017 election campaign.
The request, however, has not been fully granted by the Union of Workers.
A representative of a worker's Union said: \"It's not a technical way of managing that only four days of the week are working and it isn't really considered by the union\"
Chancellier John McDonnell used the work conference last week to explain his views of the economic socialist revolution.
McDonnell said he was willing to combine power with those — and those — who have a high interest — in big companies.
The Operation Chancellier project also means that partners with water companies may not be able to reimburse all the money they have used because the State may eliminate the price of the land if there are only a few inappropriate actions.
He also set up a plan to set up a clear space for the workers in the company and to dedicate the full amount of money to the owner of the company to give the same government to the independent employees up to 10 percent, which brings in more than 500 pounds.
-60 minutes — by Lindsey Graham, and John Kennedy if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change our minds
At least a week, the final election on the appointment of Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the FBI's investigation of his charges, and questioned whether what the office found might cause Republican senators to no longer support him.
In an interview that caused a debate on Sunday, (60 minutes), journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if anything could be published by the FBI would change their opinion.
Kennedy spoke more about his colleagues from South Carolina.
- Of course, I mean it, Kennedy said.
\"I'll come to the court\" - I told him, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, and the statement came out, and I was sentenced, ‘Did I do that?’
He was decided, ready, not too good to be bribed —
Graham's choice, however, is not broken.
- It doesn’t change in my mind in Brett Kavanaugh and it's going to be a heavy throw-out, she says.
—Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this is: \"It's a miserable Brett,\" says Graham, discussing Christine Blasey Ford.
- And the people he named could not justify it.
36 years ago.
I don't see anything new and change -
What is a Citizen's March and What's the Effect of Reduced Poverty?
The following Saturday, New York will take the National March, a annual music event that will see many artists lined up for warmth and enthusiasm; world poverty will be reduced.
In this seventh year, the National March will find more than ten thousand people in Central Park Square, not just happy to watch a show like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to get along with the movement leading to the real goal is to end poverty by 2030.
The Citizen's March, in 2012, was an extension of the World Economic War Project, an international community of ideas that is expected to end poverty by increasing the number of people involved in the fight against it.
To get the free ticket to attend the event (if you don't want to buy a ticket for VIP), the performers will have to do a number of things, or work as a volunteer, contact new world leaders, carry out phone calls or other ways to help with the campaign for their purpose is to fight poverty.
But the success of the World Citizens in 12 years to reach their goals has been called into question?
Is it really a good way to give people free tickets to be convinced of support for the call for the event, or the so-called -clickivism — only when people are well aware of the difference when they write a name for online requests and just send a call?
Since 2011, citizens have claimed that it has recorded nearly 19 million projects from its supporters, which has prompted him to pursue another goal.
It has been said that these jobs have contributed a great deal to the world’s leaders to deal with and pay close to 37 million dollars in order to save the lives of more than 2,25 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 agreements and claims, showing the results of their work, at least 10 billion dollars have already been revolted and reinstated.
The group reported that financial aid has directly affected about 649 million people worldwide.
Among those involved in the deal was the Food Park (The Power of Nutrition), English suppliers and executives agreed to work together to help children grow legally — and promised to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help fight food shortages after more than 4700 citizens received approval.
- With the support of the English government, volunteer volunteers, government, and citizens like you, we will be able to put in place the — suffering caused by lack of food — into an under-reported historical page, such as the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman to the people during his show in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 U.K's work to improve food for mothers and children, the government said that it would give money to the project — The Food Fund — (the Power of Nutrition), which would contribute a lot to food so that mothers and some 5 million children could enjoy it.
In response to the question on his website's question, \"Why do you believe we can end poverty?
Most citizens responded, \"This will be a long and difficult way\" - we may sometimes fall, may not succeed.
However, like ethnic conflicts and anti-racial movements before us, we will win because it will be stronger when we get together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe, is among those who will participate in this year's event in New York, which will be adopted by Deborra- Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could have used the naval force to prevent — to prevent the US from exporting energy — Secretary of Interior
“If necessary — Washington can call for his naval forces to prevent Russia’s energy from spreading in the market, including the Moyen Orient, please, according to U.S. Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington’s Monitor.
Zinke claimed that Russia's agreement with Syria- if marked, which occurred at the invitation of legal governments - was just a way to dig a new power market.
- I think why they are in the Moyen Orient is because they want to consume energy just as they did in Europe, the wealth of southern Europe — he said.
And as the angel spake unto him, so it was precious in the sight of him that had the power to break it up.
- The United States of America, with our navy, is able to confirm that sea travel is open and even if it is necessary to stop their energy from going out in the market, she says.
Zinke asked the audience to turn to America by the Association of Energy Consumers, an independent organization that maintains the voice of the energy -
He went on to compare Washington's plan with his agreement with Russia and Iran, and noted that both are really equal.
\"The economic choice, whether Iran or Russia, can be said to be financial support and oil exchange,\" he says, and compares Russia to a burgeon — with an underground oil economy.
The announcement came while Trump's delegation was still in operation to encourage the export of natural gas in Europe, instead of Russia, the easier for European consumers.
Thus, President Donald Trump convinced Germany that he himself would leave the Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump's opinion, made Berlin a spoil of Moscow —
Moscow has repeatedly asserted that Nord Stream 2 channels worth 11 billion dollars, which are intended to double the production of channels that are working to become 110 billion cubic meters, are a clean economic project.
The Kremlin explained that Washington’s relentless opposition to the project was solely for economic reasons and showed a bad example in the contest of injustice.
(I think we all agree that energy should not be used to pressure and consumers should be able to choose their own donors) said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak at his meeting with the U.S. Power Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
It was the American handout that brought Germany back and reaffirmed her commitment to the project.
The leaders of German industrial organizations, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the Americans not to enter the European Union's administration of energy and the two international agreements of Berlin and Moscow.
(BDI) I had a serious problem when a third government ran to supply us with energy — Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after the meeting with Chancellier Germany Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
- Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential career will concentrate, says Massachusetts's senator
Masssachusetts Elizabeth Warren's senator said that he would have a strong support for the presidential election next time.
During a meeting in Holyoke Massachusetts, Warren talked about his trip.
- This is an opportunity for women to go to Washington and save our government and fight to have a woman at the top, please, according to The Hill's report.
- I'll take a closer look at the presidential election, after November 6th -
Warren has even brought up Donald Trump at a meeting at the town hall and said that his country is in a different country.
\"I really want to be there for Donald Trump to do our democracy,\" he says.
Warren is well known for his criticism of Trump and the politician at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
In one of Friday's calls, Warren said — Of course we need an investigation by the FBI before the election —
However, a survey conducted on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s members did not agree with their request for 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of those — a guarantee - a voter from Massachusetts said the senator should not fall, according to the University of Suffolk/ Boston Globe poll Institute of Political Research.
Thirty-two percent agreed to his travel.
The survey showed that the former Governor Deval Patrick has a significant support for the fall, 38 percent support him in the competition and 48 percent do not support.
Many other Democratic officials have argued that President Joe Biden and Vermont's senator Bernie Sanders might compete for 2020.
Biden said he would make his public decision in January as reported by the Journalists Association.
Sarah Palin recounts the experience of Track Palin during Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in September.

Nation 18 D.C. support for the rejection of new asymmetry policy
States 18 years old and Columbia district require legal challenges for a new American national policy against asylum for victims of crime or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 countries and districts requested the Presidential Friday in Washington to support anti-political asylum traitors, reports NBC News.

The American news policy has abolished the decision of the immigration Council that he approved in 2014 that allowed illegal immigrants to escape domestic violence to implement asylum.
The district of Columbia, prosecutor Karl Racine, said in Friday's statement that the new policy — but not a lack of understanding of the ten-year-old state, federal and international rights —
The federal law requires that all courts have to deal with the situation and the situation, and the system that is against this order, - according to the supporters of the court.
The lawyer stated that the policy of dismissal of immigrants is damaging the American economy, claiming that they could be business-workers and — to provide physical assistance —

The U.S. Embassy accused China of \"torning\", in the campaign -
A week after the official Chinese newspaper, they published four-page advertisements in an American newspaper showing the common American-Chinese trade interest, accusing the US embassy of China in Beijing of using American newspapers to spread ideas
US last Wednesday, President Donald Trump - the most popular newspaper in Iowa’s position - said about China Daily's aid at the Moines Register on November 6.
Trump's charge that Beijing has been harassing the US elections noted what American authorities have said about Reuters: a new step in developing Washington's campaign of pressure on China.
Although it is not unusual for the foreign government to set up advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting for trade rights similar to export.
China's crackdown on the beginning of the war was launched against countries such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, says Chinese and American scholars.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador of China and former governor of Iowa, a major agricultural entrepreneur in China, said Beijing was raising workers, farmers and companies in the United States.
In an article published in the Sunday newspaper Des Moines, Branstad wrote for China: \"He has doubled the threat now by spreading the advertising of free media.
\"In the launch of its campaign, the Chinese government uses the popular tradition for freedom of speech and freedom of the media by placing monetary advertising through the list of Des Moines,\" writes Branstad.
- On the other hand, in Beijing magazine, you can see the number of unlimited opponents and you can't see the true view of Chinese people's differing views of China's economic oppression in China, to be strongly controlled. The Chinese Communist Party is, as it is written.
He also said that — one of China’s most popular newspapers — rejected the post's services — even though he did not directly mention the newspaper.
Investigators warned the Republic to protect voters before nine years with the Kavanaugh case
Many Republicans support and defend the candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh court, in the face of many statements on sexual violence, one observer warned that they would show violent tweets, especially to women, during the upcoming elections.
The results of this situation are very strong and most of the Republicans have already announced that they want to vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, University of Syrakuse, left a post published on Saturday.
The last minute of the FBI investigation, Jeff Flyake's attempt to calm the voter's anger.
- The girls will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget tomorrow and even in November — Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and spokesman of the MoveOn country, according to the news agency Washington, DC
On Friday morning, protesters shouted, ‘May be November!’ - as they showed in the law of the National Assembly when the Republicans decided to hand over the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
- The promotion of democracy and the motivation for democracy will not be included in the chart, - i.e. Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst who has no support in the news site.
- People say that it’s on the rise; it’s true.
But it may be higher, especially rural voters and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age, even though they do not like the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's testimony against his accusation of the Supreme Court of Sexual Abuse, analysts announced that the answer could arise if the Republic continues with confirmation.
— It caused confusion for the GOP, — i.e. Michael Steele, president of the former republic's national committee, at the beginning of the week, according to NBC News.
—Not just the election of the committee or the last elections, nor just the establishment of Kavanaugh, but also the way the Republicans and how they conducted it, ¿Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps the elected democracy, told the television.
However, it seems that Americans share two stories of who should believe in his testimony and that Ford is more believers than Kavanaugh
YourGov's investigation found that 41% of the people who were convicted believed in the testimony ford, while 35% said that Kavanaugh believed it was not.
Moreover, 38% said Kavanaugh lied in his testimony, 30% said that Ford was the same.
After Flyake's rape, the FBI investigated the charges issued by Ford and another critic, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Justice Committee during his last week's oath that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17.
Ramirez announced that the Supreme Court's Candidate showed his virginity while attending a party during a study in Yale in 1980.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to be used on Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, set up its beginnings to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest global technology project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid lets the user choose where the saved data will be located and who can log in on the notification.
In a special interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that — the world's rule — is the goal of the Inrupt —
- We have to do this,” she says to the new company.
It's a special blow. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The program uses technology in an effort to enable people to create — specifically internalized on the Internet — or their own POD.
There may be lists of browsers, lists of objects, recordings, music lists, and other special and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are present with (navigateur) one and the same time.
What distinguishes the personal online data website is the user's ability to obtain the type of information.
This is the company's call for special power through data —
According to the company's director general John Bruce, the Inrupt's goal is to provide a source of power, experience and special ability to make it available to everyone.
The company is now Berners-Lee, Bruce, in an IBM-selected security platform, shared by entrepreneurs working with projects and volunteer communities.
Since this week, tech users around the world can create an application for themselves using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team aren't talking to the \"Facebook and Google\" in order to bring about a complete change that will completely change his model of his business in recent times.
- We don't ask for permission from them —
In an article on the Medium that was published last Saturday, Berners-Lee said \"The volunteer mission is to provide commercial and environmental energy to protect the dignity and quality of the new news site\"
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when the World Wide Web Consortium was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee participated in the debate on the lack of the Internet.
Despite the start of the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, site construction and Open Data Institute.
- I really hope for this new time of the website,” Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Victoria’s First World War Games Celebrated · Global Voices
The only Church leader in the Anglican Church received the Victorian cross during World War I as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
The Colonel Lietn The Reverend Bernard Vann won the prize on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglishe and Lehaucurt.
He did not even know that he had received an award from the English army but was killed four days later by a professional shooter.
On Saturday, a statue of his two grandsons was shown during the parade, in Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that there is an important historical point — the reason the monument was shown 100 years after the war that his grandfather was well known.
According to London Gazette, the lieutenant-colonel Van led a military battle at Saint-Quentin canal, in a harbour and gun explosion across the war zone — on September 29, 1918.
Then he ran to the shooting station, and in the most unusual and dignified manner — he led the group ahead of him, and then he shot himself and killed three people from the enemy band.
A German gun gunman killed the French-colonel Vann on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, says he can’t — what his grandfather has done, and that makes him - it's a humble person.
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also placed a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was (he was very happy to participate in the rose), and he also said that \"a person is very brave if there are many supporters of him\"
MMA supporters slept to see Bellator 206; but Peppa Pig appeared again
Imagine you slept and enjoyed watching Bellator 206, but then you will not be allowed to look at the most interesting of the program.
There were 13 battles in San Jose's schedule, and six of them were most interested, being sent all night in Royaume-Uni, on Canal 5.
However, at six o’clock in the morning when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, all British viewers were surprised and surprised because the program suddenly turned into Peppa Pig.
Some are very surprised because they have been sleeping to watch the competition only.
One viewer said on Twitter that \"the children's film is a real illusory song.\"
\"In the state law, the program does not deserve to be run at 6:00 a.m. the program is required to be replaced by a program for children,” says Dave Schwartz, head of Bellator's business and relations.
>>zsm_Latn<< ← Peppa the pig, ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ ˈ
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said he's looking forward to a British audience for the next session.
Coker said that he'd like to be sent back — and - find a solution —
“ We have been on Sunday at six o’clock in the morning, so we can’t solve the problem if we don’t come on Sunday, at our hour.
But we are looking for a solution.
We felt that there was a lot of messages received, and most of the writers were not happy.
We are trying to solve the problem now. We thought it was a technical problem,
That's a state problem.
We promise that these examples will not happen again in the future.
We're going to reduce the number of competitions to five rather than six. We've been doing our best, but we've tried to make the audience happy, but it's getting too much.
It's also very sad -
Diska Desert Island: Tom Daley felt inferior to others
Tom Daley, an Olympic swimmer, says that he felt \"a little more\" than others when he was tall, because he loved a man, but that made him decide to be successful.
The 24 - year - old boy said he had just been in secondary school to feel that — we don’t know anyone like him —
He commented on the program offered by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4 Desert, saying that men who love men and women have the right to give — hope — to others.
He also said that when he had children, it became less important to him to win the Olympic Games.
The director, Kirsty Young, had been sick for months.
Daley was like a shipwrecker on his first program with Laverne, and he said that he felt like he was — as if compared to others when he grew up because — it was not accepted by society as a manly man, or a woman of love —
She says: \"It always felt inferior to others, but that is what gives me the strength and makes me decide to succeed\"
He wants to show people that he’s doing something — so people won’t be so discouraged when he knows he loves men.
He received a double bronze medal and wanted to support LGBT. He appeared in public during the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, using the opportunity to say that all countries should be blocked and that the LGBT should not be banned.
He said he was speaking because he knew he was lucky. He was not accused of being allowed to go with a free man, and he wanted to give — others too.
The winner of the world's owner three times said he was murdered by a man. That's who the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013. — I didn’t hope —
Daley married the winner of Oscar last year, aged 20.
- When you were young - he participated in the first Olympic Games at 14 years of age, and his father died of cancer three years later — it was hard to see someone of your age who had the same experience as yours —
They had two children in June, a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that things had changed — how they thought and saw —
\"If you asked me last year, I would say \"I'm going to get the gold medal\" he said.
\"For you see that something is more important than gold medals.\"
Robbie is my gold medal. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The son brings his grandfather's name. He died in his 40th year of 2011, when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Daley said that his father never agreed that he would die, and his last request was to get a ticket for London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first place to see his son.
I couldn't say to him, \"You won't be looking at me first\"
When he died, I realized that he could die — he said.
Daley took part in the Olympic Games the following year, that is, in 2012, and received the copper medal.
- This is what I dreamed from childhood, to swim in front of so many people in the Olympics.
It also inspired him to choose his songs — Proud de Heather Small - who gave him the strength to prepare for the Olympic Games.

Mickelson was not allowed to join Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will try to find his best on Sunday, while playing the 47th game with Ryder Cup, but he must try to pay for his efforts so as not to make it a great loss to him.
Mickelson participated in the event every two 12 years, but Caritaine Jim Furyk removed from four footballs on Saturday.
Although many, like in the United States, should be focused on it, he has been in a full day with a girl pump, and has tried to correct his wrong actions.
It's not easy to lead, though it's very popular. 48 years old, but it doesn't fit the Golf National game, because if it's not proper to launch the ball, it's gone completely.
Although the place is difficult to play, she will face the famous British, Francesco Molinari in the enemy game that she will play on Sunday, which is accompanied by the four winners this week, who is none but Tommy Fleetwood.
Mickelson's game is very important, especially if he is trying hard at the start, as the American team has lost four times in the 12 simple games.
Furyk said he was very confident of his players, but he did not say much.
“I know how important it is to do this today, and they beat me a little, and he picked me up and said he was ready for the game tomorrow — Furyk said.
He was very confident.
She has been one of the most popular performers in the Temple, and has been a great support to her team ever since this week.
I didn’t think he would play twice.
For I hope he will play more than this: for we believe that this is the case.
He wants to be like everyone else —
Mickelson will get more marks than Nick Faldo on the Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
This may be the last time he plays the Ryder Cup, which has received the greatest mark of all his games.
Mickelson won 18 times, broke intervenant-20 and got emps in 7, even though Furyk said he had caused the team to come to the extreme.
- He laughs even if he is somewhat sarcastic, very tactful, likes to laugh at others, it's nice to have him in the team - he says.
(I think he and the young people in the team this week were happy, and it was wonderful to see it.
Not only does it play but it really gives a lot of.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knew they could be killed.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain from his experience, knows that even though they are leading a little ahead of the games that two players are fighting on the last day of Ryder Cup, they can easily change their course.
In 1997 the Dano played first in Valderrama, the team of Sever Ballesteros won five more than the American team, but it just arrived first. They won 141⁄2-13 1⁄2.
- Keep reminding yourselves that we led to Valderrama, we led to Brookline, who defeated us, and to Valderram, but this is what we have defeated — Bjorn, photographed after watching the Class of 2018 earned 5-3 marks on Friday and yesterday, leading 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in the team that it's not done.
You are doing your best tomorrow.
Go to the square and do all the right.
It's not yet done, but we're still looking for a mark to hang in the window.
This is our goal: get the pick, that's what we're focusing on.
I've always said that my 12 players are my main target, but we also know that one of the world’s best experts is against us —
Bjorn was pleased with his players at the busy golf stadium, and he added: \"I shouldn't think I am already familiar with this topic.
It's not clear what the next day will bring out.
After all, it can be a different thing to play each morning.
It's nice to play together when everything's right, but when you're asked to play alone, your golf skills are real.
That's the message that needs to be delivered to the players, that you give your best tomorrow.
\"Don't think of your friend, but let him give him the best that he has.
Unlike Bjorn, Furyk does not like Bjorn, because he wants everyone to try to give him his best, as if they did when he was with his friends, but he dedicated Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, as he won three of the four games.
Furyk was always there at the end of the momentous and mixed days, from the winning team in Brooklyn before it was won when Europe took over the #Miracle at Medinah -
\"I remember all the talk in it,\" she explains how Ben Crenshaw, a centurion in 1999, assembled the players on the final day of the game.
- There are 12 major games tomorrow, but you should be ready soon to begin this example of what you saw in Brooklyn, as you have seen in Medina.
This move, when moving to one side, puts a lot of pressure on the games in the front.
And then we're in line, and all the children are dressed in the clothes we love, you see, we're really amazing tomorrow.
Thomas tried to lead the match with Rory Mcllroy in the worst game, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the European elite in his ranks.
- I chose this group following this series because I think it has been done to the end,” Bjorn explains his choice for the match between two players.
The arrival of new German warships has been postponed again
The new German army was supposed to have arrived in 2014 to throw off the warship in the days of the Cold War, but he has not yet come there for at least a year for reasons of construction and rising prices according to media reports.
The use of the —Rheinland-Pfalz — the arrival of a ship of leaders of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class was postponed by a military spokesman in Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was supposed to have been used in the navy in 2014, but it was due to its transportation problem that destroyed the project that had been laid out.
The four so-called Baden-Wuerttemberg ships returned by the navy in 2007 will replace the kinds of Bremen ships that are getting older.
Obviously, they will have a powerful bow, a type of aircraft fighter, a boat and a technological spy, such as a hidden little raft, a radio and a special identifier.
His long term of control is also a special one, it may be possible to bring these new ships out of the port within two years.
However, the continued delay meant that the latest warships supposed to see German power on the coast would take the day before it was to be used, as the Die Zeit noted.
The F125 ship named luck last year became new, when the German Navy officially refused to use it and returned it to Blohm & Voss harbor in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the navy returned the boat to its repairers.
The reason for his return is not clear, but the German media said that it was not a matter of economic and physical uncertainty — it was beyond the means of using the peaceship.
The lack of information is a serious problem because 120 sailors will take the ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg by half of the people carrying the old Bremen kind of ship.
In addition, it was evident that the vessel was too heavy and reduced its speed and limited the special reforms made by the navy.
It is believed that it was twice as much a load as the German average boat used in the Second World War — Rheinland-Pfalz - 7,000 tons.
In addition to physical incompetence, the cost of the entire project, including training its crews, has also become a problem.
It is said to be up to 3.1 billion euros (or 3.6 billion dollars), rather than at first 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest ships as recently warned that Germany’s sea power is falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s security committee, admitted that \"We don't have enough concrete and sufficient boats\" — the navy —
The officer said that the problem had grown so quickly as the old ships had stopped being used but no new boat had been given to replace him.
He even complained that not one of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships could be used in the navy.
National Trust detects the secrets of the father's life
A new study conducted in Scottland’s upper part of the country found how the birds used to hunt for food in the rural plains.
It is hoped that this single mammal will better explain how to live, but this research is flying and will help protect the future nature.
The scientific research at the National Trust in Scotland will focus on the -pistrelles — common and (soprano) — as well as the yellow-colored ears and the Grandparents in Inverwee Gardens, Wester Ross.
People will be sent to the site to record the attitudes and lives of the birds during the specified period.
The NHS staff and a number of volunteers will also conduct a free investigation using hands-benefits.
Professionals will then use the available records, including the call of a uncle and how this type or kind of thing is done.
There will be pictures of the homes of the uncles and reports to be made to create pictures of their actions in the rurals.
Hopeful is Rob Dewar, a NTS counselor and a naturalist, that the results of the research show where the parents need the most and how they live in every kind.
This will help to determine the benefits of managing the habitats of these animals, such as creating grass and how forested places can be maintained as much as possible.
Fathers in Scotland and the whole of Britain have evidently been wiped out for centuries.
High - rise buildings and a form of development that damages their homes and homes.
Lights and power machines, such as drums and other chemical instruments used for building materials, can also be dangerous.
But the birds are not even blind.
However, as a hunter in the night, his ears work more than his eyes when he grabs his prey.
He uses a very complex and complex technique to see clearly the insects he has encountered and the problems that might prevent him from flying.
The NTS, which handles more than 270 historic buildings, is a 38-purpose garden and in 76,000 hectares across the country, is taking full control of the bird’s care.
He has ten professionals, regularly investigates, monitors and sometimes even saves.
Scotland was even built by the top organization at the Threeave park in Dumfries and Galloway, home of eight kinds of birds from Scotland.
David Thompson, the administrator of the country, said that it was their best place.
- We have a place for the uncle in Threeave, he said.
- We have a lot of buildings, lots of old trees and suitable places to live.
But there are still many unknown things about the father, believe that our work here and elsewhere will help us understand what they really need to grow quickly —
He emphasized that it is important to monitor the father before taking care of the places because only the accidental destruction of a nest can kill up to 400 female and her children, and the whole group may be wiped out.
Animal protection and the law prohibits killing them, tortures them or harms their nest.
Elisabeth Farrell, who was privately appointed to be the overseer of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, urged the public to submit to it.
He said: \"We have so much to learn about germs that, for most of our species, we don't just know what their species are--
Ronaldo dismissed his charges of expulsion and the lawyers decided to preach a German magazine
Christian Ronaldo insisted that — a false new — her accusation of expulsion, and said that — to the public they used their name.
The German newsmagazine Der Spiegel denied that his lawyer published the charges.
Portugal's and Juventus players were charged with taking an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga to a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is reported that he then cost the woman 375,000 dollars to not tell the story, as Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Christian Ronaldo, 33 years old, a few hours after the complaint broke out, spoke directly through Instagram video to his more than 142 million fans and followers, and repeatedly said that — you’re not — it’s —
- No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, is a false news, - i.e. the winner of his fifth gold Baolin and turned to photographers.
- They want to be public, and use my name.
It's legal.
They want to tell me my name, it's part of the work.
I was happy and not entirely worried - the player said, and he laughed.
Ronaldo's lawyers were preparing to accuse Der Spiegel for the false accusation, they called — unacceptable statements and personal concerns — that are according to Reuters report.
Lawyer Christian Scherts said that he should ask for compensation due to the — a reflection of the extent of the incident and the effect — which is undoubtedly part of the violation of a person’s rights, the greatest of the moment —
It was said that it occurred at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After they met in a dance hall, according to reports, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where they were taken to their office, according to a report filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorgana then said Ronaldo fell after the incident and told him that he could be said to be a good-99 percent - but he was hit by the one-percent-
The report said Ronaldo agreed that they had sexual relations but had agreed -
Mayorga also said she went to the police and had a picture of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed not to raise the case because she (feared that the case might be based on her again) and thought that she could be \"surprisingly.\"
The 34-year-old woman said she's going back to the case and she's still shaking because of the incident.
Ronaldo was in line for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the accusation, and moved to Juve Italian capitals after a 100 million euro deal this summer.
Brexit: Grande Brettne will be ‘forevering’ about how the carmakers left.
- Grande Bretagne would have gone away forever — if she lost her position as a foreigner in the production of a global car after her departure, says Secretary Greg Clark.
In terms of Toyota he said his contribution, Britain told BBC that if he left the European Union without a measure, the production of the Burnaston plant, near Derby, could be delayed.
- We need a deal - said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of shock caused by problems in the border as a result of Bretagne's absence could result in a lot of work.
The Burnaston building where Auris and Avensis of Toyota produce nearly 1500,000 cars last year was sold 90% to European Union member countries.
\"As I can see, if Bretagne left the European Union at the end of March, we will see that the production in our plant will remain — according to Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other manufacturers for Grande-Bretegne raised concerns about their departure from the European Union, with no respect for how to conduct trade exchanges, such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar and Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said he would shut down his production plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
What's really worried is what drivers say about the impact that Brexit's lack of agreement can have on the supply chain.
Toyota's method of production is based on the (time), with a 7-minute session coming from a driver in the same country-Uni and the European Union for a car that was intended to end.
If Royaume-Uni left the European Union without any agreement on March 29, there may be chaos in the border that could lead to the shock and lack of pies, according to the project.
Toyota will not be able to stay for more than a day to monitor his factory building in Derby, says the company's management, and the production has to be suspended.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's plan on relations with the European Union was to set a clear mark to prevent cross-country hacks -
- We need to make a deal we want to set the right conditions, not just to live success now as I said we can take advantage of this situation and benefit us, he said on a program on radio 4 BBC today.
-Toyota is just more evidence now that there are other producers we need to continue the same way of working together that has led to great success ever since —
The Toyota company can't say how long the production will stop, but he says it's a problem that may take place, as commitments can reduce competition with other manufacturers and cause unemployment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year-old member of the Society’s Assembly at the factory, said that its members were deeply affected — As soon as I found them, these jobs did not return.
The government's spokesman also said: \"We need to set up a plan that is dead and successful for future relations with the European Union\"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein might be delayed again by \"Maison Blanche\"
The meeting that would make up for Donald Trump and the Supreme Court's temporary president Roseenstein would have to take over once a week — as the battle against Brett Kavanaugh continues on Sunday, says the Maison Blanche newspaper.
Roseinsten closely monitors the actions of the lawyer Robert Muelle, the latter who is investigating the interference in Russia's elections, the relationship between Trump and Russia and the possible threat of the court.
Whatever the case, Trump will expel the supreme president, and Mueller will not be able to leave, i.e. Washington's embezzlement for months.
Rosenstein said to take a voice on Trump and talked about the possibility of expelling the president by the 25th rule of the New York Times earlier this month.
Roseinstein rejected the report.
However, on Monday he went to Maison Blanche, and another report was received that he was about to leave.
But there was a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York, as it was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not take Rosenstein away, but the start of the meeting was delayed to prevent controversy during the hearing of the Senate Committee of Kavanaugh and a woman who accused him of misconduct, Dr.Christine Blasey Ford, who both testified.
On Friday, Trump conducted a week's FBI investigation of the complaint about Kavanaugh, and your election to the Senate has been totally abandoned.
Sarah Sanders, the deputy secretary of Trump, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about meeting with Rosenstein, she said: \"The date has not been sitting yet, probably this week, I have seen all the other things going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I'll always tell the journalists--
Some journalists have not accepted the apology: Sanders has never gathered journalists at Maison Blanche since September 10.
Chris Wallace, director of the program, asked why.
Sanders replied that the relief of the gathering of journalists is not due to a lack of love for the news reporters — even on TV he said: \"I don't refuse to be angry with them\"
He promised to increase the special meeting between journalists and Trump.
- The president is holding a meeting of Questions and Answers compared to his previous presidents, eh, without any mention of evidence: \"But we have looked at these figures--
There will still be a meeting, says Sanders, but — if journalists have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States direct questions, that is better than talking to me.
We will blame it as much as we can and see that we have done so many times over the past weeks and this will replace the press gathering so that you can talk to the president of the United States — . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Trump always answers questions when he leaves the Maison Blanche or when he participates in a free assembly or a press gathering when he visits the authorities.
This conversation with journalists is not unique.
Perhaps this week, the president in New York showed why he did not pay attention and post strangely when the journalists met.
The health secretary wrote to the EU staff at NHS Scoltand about his concerns about Grande-Bretegne's possible resignation
The Secretary of Health wrote to European Union employees working at the NHS in Scotland to express the gratitude of his country and his desire to remain after Bretagne's departure.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter to travel for less than six months by Grande-Bretegne in the European Union.
The European Union has already agreed to pay the price of citizens' hands for the Ecosse government.
Mrs Freeman, in her letter, said: \"During the summer, the agreement between Grande-Bretegne and the European Union on the escape continued, leading to the decision to be made in this fall.
But the British state is preparing for the possibility of conflict.
I know that all of you are tentative.
That's why I'm saying it's important for me to have everyone's share, not look at their country from.
Workmates across the European Union and others abroad share the vital experience and knowledge needed to strengthen and improve the health work and also benefit our patients and organizations.
You are so sorry for Scotland and we really want you to stay here
Christon Abercrombie Faces Surgery After Head Pain
The post in the Tennessee State Tigra team faced an emergency operation after a head injury on Saturday, defeating Vanderbilt Commodores in 31-27, according to Mike Organ's Tennessee report.
Rod Reed, a Tennessee State trainer, told the journalist that the damage had occurred shortly before the end of the first episode.
\"He was on the edge of the court, it was like a flood,\" says Reed.
Abercrombie was given at the edge of the park before she was confined to a hospital ward and brought back to visit.
An official from Tennesse State told Chris Harris of WSMV's staff in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was released for surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that he still has no known reputation for the injury — and will try to help the Tennessee State when the operation goes.
Abercrombie was one of the second red class and the first time she played in Tennessee State, after moving from Illinois.
He had five tackle summaries on Saturday before the park emerged, which makes 18 tackles combined during this play period.
Buyers from abroad will demand higher taxes when they buy land or houses in Royaume-Uni
Foreign buyers will demand higher taxes when they create goods in Britain and will contribute more money to help the homeless in the new Tory plan
This protest will prevent Corbyn's success in his campaign to attract young voters
This higher tax is expected by those who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The State Fund hopes that it will rise up to 120 million each year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will demand higher taxes when they create goods in Britain and will contribute more money to help the homeless, So says Theresa May today
It would be considered an attempt to hinder Jeremy Corby's success in his process of attracting young voters, he promised to provide a residence for the high-payers and high-payers.
Everyone and non-tax companies in Britain will be expected to pay this high tax, adding money to help support the government's fight on street hibernation.
The current high tax rate, including the highest taxes demanded since the two years when two houses are owned and the purchase of a home for training can be up to three percent.
The State Fund hopes that it will rise to 120 million pounds per year.
Eleven percent of the new buildings built in London are estimated to have been bought by foreigners who live in England, making it expensive and difficult for those who buy it to own it.
Many of the richest parts of the country in the capital have been — Dead — as many foreigners are living in the country but spend most of their time abroad.
Applying the new policy, Boris Johnson made a high appeal for the tax to help young people to own their own homes.
He said that the lands and houses became too expensive because they were hit by big construction companies but they didn't use them, and he encouraged Rtoa May to limit the possibility of buying homes to pay for — Britain’s material material resources —
Mr. Corbyn has made some interesting comments about the change in home affairs, including the monitoring of the housing and the removal of the eviction — for no reason —
He also wanted to give more authority to the authorities to be able to create a new house.
Ms. May said: \"I told last year that the prime thing to restore Britain's dream would be to have a better generation.
And that means that our health will be solved in the home market.
England is open to people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is not possible to be as easy as anyone who is not living in Britain, like a foreign company, to buy a home similar to the Brazilian people who are working hard.
For many people it is just a dream to have a house, and the shame caused by the street sleeping is still visible and there is--
Jack Ross: ‘My greatest wish is to reach Scotland'
Jack Ross, director of Sunderland, said that his greatest desire is to keep Scotland better.
The 42-year-old Scot is happy and ready to revive the North-East club, which has the third number of the First League now, less than three in the first ranks.
The summer he moved to the Light Square after leading St Mirren back to Scotland's Stadium in the final game.
- I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's it,” Ross said in the BBC voice of the Ekosy Spano.
- I grew up watching Ekosy in Hampden often with our father as a child, and that is always what brought me back.
I can do this, however, if I succeed in managing the club -
Ross succeeded in managing Sunderland: Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic administrator said that it was not possible for him to follow the designated names for such a wild club, if the services from Barnsley and Ipswich Town were rejected.
#My first success is now controlled by ‘Can I go back to the club with the First League?'
Because because of the way the club works and cares, it is sure to belong to the First League,” she says.
- It's not an easy job here, but I think I'll be successful if I can go back to the club —
Ross has been a manager for only three years, after working for a while as a assistant director at Dumbarton and being one of the enthusiastic trainers there for 15 months.
Thus, he helped Alloa to get up after his third turn, and took St Mirren from the retreat to the victory Cup, the next time.
And Ross says he's getting more rest now than ever during his career in Cycle, Hartletool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
- This is definitely a chance,” she says, of the acceptance of Alloa.
- I firmly believe that it is better for me to take the lead than to play the game.
It was like a strange hearing, but I did not mind it, and tried to have some high views.
But playing can be tough.
You have many things to go through every week.
I’m still living in it when I’m very busy and involved by work and the management is going on for it.
I've always wanted to be in charge and I've been doing so, this is what I feel I've been the best for the rest of my life —
You will hear the entire interview on Radio Scotland from 12 hours to 1 afternoon on Sunday, September 30.
It's a good time to drink beer on Saturday evening at 5:30, according to the survey
The market hasn't gone through these alcoholic beverages, but it is now full of people due to the rising heat, but the restaurant is losing people.
According to the survey, the income of the alcohol market increased by 2.7 percent in July, while the restaurant dropped by 4.8 percent.
When Peter Martin, a CGA company counselor, saw these figures, he said: \"The day has always been hot and England has played a longer part in the Kitra Games Cup, and the situation has gone on since July.
The restaurant's income in June dropped by 1.8 percent, and the market went further in July.
It has become the most popular and boring place of alcohol stores since the restaurant hasn't been released.
Farmers were also not spared these temperatures, but they were benefited in comparison to the restaurant.
It seems that people just want to get out to drink.
The sales in these well-supervised alcohol stores increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and the restaurant dropped by 3 percent —
Paul Newman, a evaluator and guest at the RSM, said: \"This thing has been from April, and continues.
Street vendors have become more extreme because of weather and sports competition.
It is not surprising, then, that the restaurants are always in trouble. This is a great price to them because the amount spent the year has dropped by 4.8 percent, but the cost of rising and rising prices is constant.
Food traders are very efficient because of the intense heat during the summer, but we don't know if the climate change changed in August -
While the interest rate of alkake’s exports, including those who opened up, increased by 2.7 percent in July, although the advertising did not exist.
The company organizer of Coffer Peach Tracker examined the results of the organization of 47 cafes and alcoholic beverages and food items in the English country, and found that the round money cost 9 billion pounds, which led to good travel.
One child every five has a secret account on the Internet site that he doesn't know about his parents
A survey found that one child every five — 11 years of age — has a secret account on a sergeant website that he doesn't know about his parents or teachers
Children of 20,000 high school students were interviewed and many said they had a page - hidden in the Insta —
The news says they are threatened with the increase of their share of pornography.
The 20 percent of these children say they have accounts — uniquely — to inform their parents
1 child every 5 — who is 11 years old — has a secret account on a cyber site that he doesn't know about adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that more and more children have accounts — hidden in the Instagram website, which is available.
The news says they are threatened with the increase of their share of pornography.
Twenty percent of the children say they have a (only) account — to show their parents, but they also have a secret account.
A mother chance to see her 13-year-old daughter's account, finding a young man telling someone: \"I'm sick\"
The research, done by Digital Awareness UK and the head of private schools (HMC), found that 40 percent of youths aged 11 to 18 have two accounts, and half of them admitted that they have a secret account.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: \"It’s difficult that so many young people want to open a secret account that their parents and teachers don't know —
Eilidh Doyle will be the \"threatening of athletes\" — in the Scottish Athletics council
Eilidh Doyle was the only person who was invited by the Scottish Athletics administration to be the director of the annual assembly of the organization.
Doyle, the most famous athlete in Scotland, and President, Ian Beattie, announced that this was done so that sports organizers could benefit from Doyle's skills and experience in the last ten years of the international level.
- Eildh highly respects sports organizations in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that sportsmen in Scotland will benefit if they become part of the council,” Beattie says.
Doyle says: \"I'm happy to represent the people of the athletes — and I hope that I can take the lead and help improve sports in Scotland —
The American, who won the winners of the 200-400-foot race at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996 — which he obtained four gold medals — and used to express sports ideas in BBC, could not go because blood remained in its brain for a short time.
He wrote on Twitter: \"I am a prisoner, a month today.
I can't go.
The physician at the time said I was not known whether I would recover, but it would depend on time and not on how.
It was so painful, that I was completely healed, and now I am starting again, and I can breathe a little!
Thank you for the encouraging message!
The online advertising of a milk-sized pet, which compares the mother to the cow, causes a debate on the internet
Advertising by a dairy plant that compares nursing mothers and cows has caused controversy over the internet.
The Elvie Foundation published a video showing a mother who comments on using this tool, when making the so-called: ← The idea of not producing the first voice available in the world’s hand -
This is part of the song that includes four mothers dancing in a straw-rich cattle house: \"I only take milk from me, but I don't have a tail\" and \"If you don't see it so bad, I don't eat it properly--
Therefore it is said to them, \"My sheep, my dove, I give the baby milk. My dove, my dove, I give these women milk.\"
However, when the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused a lot of controversy on the internet.
The video was seen by 77,000 people, and hundreds of people commented on it. People saw it differently, and many said that it was a bad story — that video for the milk factory.
The idea of using the advertisement was not valid.
Like us, these bulls need to carry milk before they are milked, unless their baby is removed shortly before they give birth,” one commenter said.
The Elvie (Elvie/Mother) pump can be hidden in the soutien gorge
Another wrote: \"There is no doubt that it will not get out of the mind of the mother and the child and will always scare them.
Why, if they are used to make a pet ad for mothers raising their children -
Others also say: \"It's a very renewable trade-
Others have made a good point about the advertisement, for example, a woman says that she is \"happily\" the song.
- It’s a good idea.
I bought an example of this while nursing
I felt like a cow when I used a pet.
The advertisement is a little stupid, but it's just that I like it.
The idea is very good,” one person said.
Another wrote: \"It has been used to make fun of a mother using a pet (in use or in a toilet) who feels like a person — that commercial.
The advertisement is not intended to open or criticize the milk-producer’s production industry -
At the end of the video, all women dancing show their puppet in the soutians.
There are so many women who feel like a cow when using a pet, which is the idea of being shown at the back of the advertisement.
The Paompy Elvie, who doesn't need a pipe but enters the soutien, has become able to move mothers or hold their children and can walk around when using the pump.
Ana Balarin, who is an ECD partner in Mother's company, commented: \"Pamppy Elvie is going to change lives so that it should be made interesting advertising to make him famous.
We want to show everyone how an elderly mother feels we compared them to cows in the advertisement, and where everyone sees the difficulties that these women find, this advertising makes people understand that women are so calm when using this pump.
Paompy Elvie has never been an interesting news item.
A mother of two children used the tool in the contest for the famous artist Marta Jakubowski during the Fashion Week in London.
Hundreds of children of immigrants were transferred to a tent camp in the Texas border
The number of children who have moved, although the number of people who have passed the border has not changed every month, is the reason that Trump’s talks and strong politics have made it so much more difficult to accept and care for these children even though there are people who are willing to guarantee their care.
In the past, these children were often the only immigrants who had no legal papers, so they became afraid that they would not be able to stay in the country if they asked to host a child.
Fear has increased since June as federal authorities have announced that adults who host children and other adults do something similar, and then the authorities who care for the migration are given their standards.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of the immigration and Custom Enforcement, told Congress that tens of people were asking to host children to the organization.
The organization then said that 70 percent of the people he caught had not yet been caught in crime.
\"More than 80 percent of the people who ask to host these, or their families, are immigrants without legal papers, and many of them are criminals in their country.
We're still looking for these people — Mr. Albance says.
The organizers are eager to settle the issues of these children and create a new law that will cause the children to go up to the palace 30 days after their arrival, not waiting for 60 days like the former custom, which used to be used by people working in their detention camps.
Many use videos, rather than coming directly when they have to be tried by a judge dedicated to immigrants.
Those who have been judged without the right to vote will be brought back quickly to their home countries.
For several months, people working in the children’s concentration camps have said that children become more frightened and discouraged after being held for a long time, becoming violent and some even trying to escape.
The lawyers said that the damage they received from larger organizations such as Tornillo was increasing.
They also said that if these children are taken to the camp but do not have enough time to prepare their minds and hearts when they leave their friends, their grief and fear will increase and they are struggling.
The American, French, and Turkish soldiers immediately asked Syria to leave their homeland.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem spoke directly to the UN Supreme Meeting and asked Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the war in the country for eight years.
Mr. Mukalem, a deputy Prime Minister, announced that the soldiers were encamped in a Syrian country without permission, as they were on the verge of a terrorist attack, and (or punishment in accordance with their currents)
- These parties should leave immediately and there will be no one in the way — he said at the top meeting.
Mr. Makalem has asserted that \"the war against terrorism will end - in Syria, and more than 3600,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have had to flee for it.
He also said that Damas — always to clean up the Syrian land — would be free of terrorists and other people living illegally — in their lands.
About 2,000 soldiers from the United States are in Syria, who are invited to train and give advice to the Kurdes and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad's rule.
There are more than 1,000 French troops in this war zone.
When Mr. Mukalem spoke of refugees, he said they could return to their homeland, and he also blamed — half of them in Western countries — who — who have spread rumors and feared — the refugees have caused them to stay away from their country.
\"We have called the International Family and Human Rights Organization to facilitate refugees' homes,\" she says.
- They're aiming to make politics a matter of human nature -
The United States and the European Union said they would not help pay for the damage in Syria unless they made an agreement with Assad to stop the war.
The United Nations diplomat said that the presence of an agreement with Russia and Turkey was able to open a political discussion on the position of co-existing a common ground between the shields with Idlib.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented Syria (Russia’s supported army) from attacking the region of three million residents.
Mubalem, however, asserted that the duration of the deal was limited and said that the jihadists expect the army to be given a special hand, so that it would be \"complete\" - including Al-Qaeda fighters connected with Nusra-Front.
Staffan de Mistura diplomat of the combined country said that the first meeting of the new committee organized by the government and the opposition to form a law for Syria to deal with the outcome of the war and to lead to elections will soon come.
Mukalem has set up measures for the intervention of the Syrian government on the committee, including the need to restrict the judicial action — to reexamination of articles in the current law — and warning of interference in other countries' affairs.
How can you be sure Trump will win the second time?
According to the logic, Trump will still win the 2020 elections unless the removal or chaos of the regime is expected by liberal investigators.
And there is no doubt that this could have been the end of the reign of history ever since!
As for now, observers are still not tired
Since 2014, the number of viewers on TV CNN has doubled to 1,05 million and MSNBC has nearly three times as many as 1.6 million.
For Fox News, 2.4 million viewers are on average, while more than 1.7 million in the last four years. According to Nielsen and MSNBC reports, the program — The Rachel Maddow Show — is the largest and most active audience since nearly 3.5 million like the new followers of the night watch it.

Expensive foreign currency was released in the presidential presidential election
It is not surprising that the 17th District funds in Pennsylvania have increased because of cooperation through district congress and have been able to set up two different rivals to fight the same place.
It was this isolated district of Pittsburgh that inspired Conor Lamb from the Democratic Republic to take place in other districts during the last special election.
Lamb now competes with other authorities, none other than the Republic Keith Rothfus, representing the 12th districts of former Pennsylvania, which are in sharp contrast to the new 17th district.
The map was redesigned after the Supreme Court decision in Pennsylvania in January that these former districts were passed illegally to benefit the Republic.
The competition for the seventeenth district created a financial conflict between the investors and the Congress of the Democratic propaganda Committee (DCCC), and the Republican National Campaign Committee on Propaganda (NRCC).
The name of Lamb after the victory of the 18th District Congress elections in Pennsylvania last March became known to people in Pennsylvania.
It has been held by the Republic for many years and by President Donald Trump has won the district by 20.
The Democrats were given a small advantage by political members.
Investigators from the U.S. Department of Justice have given El Salvador a harsh sentence for her support of China, then leave.
Many diplomats have found that Beijing has been approved by the Dominican and Panama Republic, adding a small push from Washington.
Mr. Trump's meeting with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela was successful in June 2017, he had a hotel in Panama where the security team of Trump's organization was removed by the security team.
According to a report received this month, representatives from the State Department decided to call back on US diplomats to carry out missions from El Slvador, and Panama, representatives from the Department of State to examine the — a recent decision to reject Taiwan — and Heather Nauertn and women to represent the department.
But El Salvador was the only victims of the sanctions, who received up to 140 million dollars of aid in America in 2017, including monitoring the use of domestic, development and economic resources.
The punishments that are considered to be applied, including the suppression of funding and the canceling of legal visas, will be very severe for Central America in addition to the high unemployment rates and mass murder.
According to the development of the internal meeting, the authorities in North America and Central America delayed the major peace conference and economic development to allow for such meetings as last year that it was seen as a significant step in preventing migrants from going to the United States.
But in the spring of September, the superior authorities showed that they wanted the conference to continue, so that it would end with all the punishments that El Salvador should be imposed.
Mike Pence's Prezidate Visy is now assigned to lead the conference, which should be held in mid-October, the administration has held the meeting to make a special note of what is important.
And three American representatives quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, sending harsh messages on the sanctions from Washington.
Mr. Bolton, a spokesman for \"Maison Blanche\", discussed details about the debate raised by three American authorities, with two diplomats, and agreed to examine the internal decisions and terms of anonymity.
A foreign observer, a right hand in the administration and one of those who talked about the rules of anonymity, supported their story.

The next thing that might not be accepted is Robert Mueller's personal lawyer's report on Mr. Trump's threat, which has a fair public evidence.
Mr. Mueller also went back to his investigation of how far the results of Mr. Trump's condolence with Russia on the election.
Should the Congress change the administration, Mr. Trump will have to face its responsibility, as he prepared for the elections of the people, and perhaps the judges of his friends.
There are many if, this does not mean that Mr. Trump's departure is inevitable or it's like in Europe.
Each of us will make multiple choices from both sides of the Atlantic and will affect the long term of the problem.

We have failed, and have not been able to stop the killings for many years.
History is always falling apart from the vague ideas, and rapid progress or lack of democracy.
Americans now live in conflicting and conflicting ideas.
What would we do if Mr. Trump were to abandon General Rod Rosenstein, a monitor for the investigation of Mr. Mueller?
Roesenstein's position has been broken since the report stated last year that he suggested the secret registration of the president and supported his disrespect.
Mr. Rosenstein said the story of The Times wasn't true.
- What if the F.B.I's new investigations about Brett Kavanaugh were not completely or unjustly- or if the Supreme Court gave him a clear charge of sexual violence and false testimony?
But above all, we will vote for Congress who can hold Mr Trump as responsible for his working time?
If we fail with these tests, democracy will remain in place for a long time.
But I believe we will succeed because of what I learned in Prague.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is fully prepared to meet with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers took the Rapid Vienna, knowing that if they win the Australians, as a war in Spain with Villareals this month's hair will benefit from the G category of the European League.
Graham Dorrans could not go up playing the game because of the injuries on his knees after a 2-2 match with Villareal, but he believed the Rangers could use the product as a better starting point.
- It's good for us because it's only a good place in Villareal, says the 31-year-old brother.
- We entered the game and were confident that the results would be produced with a number.
Maybe we can finally get this but, however, the war is just.
They were released for the first half, but we will also come in the second half of the time to do better.
It's coming Thursday, it's another night for Europe.
There is hope that we will get three numbers but the game will be fine because they have good results in the final game, however with the people who support us, I believe we will continue to move forward and get good results.
It was a real trial last year, in the face of my injuries and changes in the club but the location was improved right now.
The squad was so good that the boys who played it were happy; the training was very good.
We can continue to make progress, and with hope, let the past stand in the way of success -
Women looking for ways to deal with their pensions are not practical day and night.
Although it is known from the survey that members already have a clear idea of how to care for them, few people have talked about it to their family.
Half of the respondents said he spoke to his wife about the money spent on long-term treatment.
Only 10% said they talked to their children about it.
- People like to care for her family, but they're trying to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, chief of security.
This is where we begin
Talk to your wife and children. You can't expect your family to take care of you when you're sick, if you don't talk about it before.
Work with your counselor and family, and talk about how to care for your health.
Also include your counselor on financial matters: Your counselor can also advise you how to pay the same amount.
The following may be money to take care of your long - term health: sustainable health insurance, security, or personal health care. You may always be able to earn money.
Enlarge the legal letter that you shall use: as well as the letter of judgment you shall use.
Get someone to represent yourself in health matters, so that someone you trust will be responsible for monitoring that the health workers will follow your choice, if you can't talk.
Also, look for a lawyer who will take care of your money.
You'll choose someone you trust to represent to make a decision about money, and you'll be sure that your trust is paid, if you're in case you're in trouble.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your parents are old, and they need to be rushed to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about the drugs or what they don't understand?
Write these things in detail so that you will be ready.
- It's not just money, but who's the doctor?,” Martin says.
- What are the drugs?
Who will take care of dogs?
Make sure it's all pre-existing —

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, according to the authorities. This figure may still grow.
The relationship was completely lost, so the authorities did not know the news from Doyata, in the north of Palu. This was the location near the epicenter of the 7.5 earthquake on the scale.
More than 160,000 people were taken away from Palu after the accident.
Here are the accounts of Palu and Doyata, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, at the end of the flood on the coast of Sulawesi. The population is estimated to be 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th year, when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dolawa is a continent 300 km off the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The country is much smaller than the territory, so Dolawa's population is estimated to be 299 200 in 2017.
The main livelihood of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the coast of Doyasa, is the fishing, farming, and agriculture.
There are also many miners, but in Morowali, on the other coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Doyama have been affected frequently in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Service.
A tsunami struck Dolawa in 1938, killing more than 200 people, and destroying hundreds of houses.
A tsunami hit Dolawa in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in an earthquake zone in the Pacific, where earthquakes often strike it.
These are among the recent major earthquakes and tsunamis:
2004: A massive earthquake struck Aceh, North Sumatra, on the west coast of Indonesia, on December 26.
2005: A massive earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra, at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck Java, Indonesia’s largest island, causing tsunamis to destroy the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake struck the West Sumatra capital of Chang.
More than 1 100 died.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake struck the island of Mentawai, in Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached 10 metres, destroyed tens of cities, and killed about 300 people.
2016: An earthquake hit Pidie Jaya, Aceh, and destroyed things and disturbed, as people remembered the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami at this, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapse of the building.
2018: A massive earthquake struck Lombok, a tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north.
Thousands of homes were destroyed, and thousands of tourists were left homeless for a while.
Sarah Palin’s First Child Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the firstborn of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and vice president, was arrested for violence.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, is suspected of violence at home because someone told the police that he was violent. He also opposed his arrest, according to Alaska's Police report.
Police say that Palin's relatives called for the police to talk about the crime, and Palin handed the phone in his hand.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su prison, where he was sentenced to pay $500, says KTUU.
He came to court on Saturday, and said that “it is certain that he is not guilty,” according to the source.
Palin’s arrest is a simple three-celled crime, which means that he could be imprisoned for a year and pay a fine of 250,000 dollars if he was convicted.
He is also charged with a simple B acquired crime, and he may be sentenced to one day in prison and fines $20,000 if he is convicted.
This is not the first crime to persecute Palin.
He was also accused of violence against Todd Palin, his father, in December 2017.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called on the police to report for this.
Alaska's Supreme Court is now considering the case.
He was convicted of domestic violence in January 2016, according to reports, armed and drunk.
The woman with her said that she had been hit by the fist in her face.
In 2016, armed soldiers criticized Sarah Palin for saying that her violent nature is associated with Iraq's military service.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds Die · Global Voices
At least 384 people were killed by the earthquake that struck Sulawesi, island of Indonesia, on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami, destroying thousands of homes.
Lights and phones are destroyed, and the number of deaths may increase.
The quake hit most in the heart of Sulawesi, which is in northeastern Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are videos on different websites, showing the earthquake.
Hundreds of people attended a holiday on the beach, when the tsunami hit Palu.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death sentence of the accused of terrorist activity in New York.
New York's federal prosecutors wanted Saybully Saipov to be sentenced to death, accused of terrorist activity in New York, killing eight people. Such punishments were rare in New York, after 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, is said to have used a truck to attack people on the bicycle road, on the West Coast, at Manhattan Bottom. He has been riding several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
The prosecutors must prove his reason for being sentenced to death, \"you have a spirit of silence\" — Saipov has killed eight people, and — you have taken up a spirit — a human attack, in the case of a death sentence, placed in the South District of New York.
These two charges may lead to death penalty, according to the court's letter.
A few weeks after the attack, the helper judge sentenced Saipov to 22 cases, including eight charges of murder by criminal activity (a criminal criminal punishment), and violence and car damage.
The attack, the prosecutor said, demanded — a good plan and a good conscience — and explained the way Saipov had taken the attack — is full of hatred and cruelty and is very bad -
-Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has done something to harm, attack, and create a breakdown for the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Panucco, according to the lawsuit filed.
Five of the dead are tourists from Argentina.
The South Court of New York has been taking over the last ten years of the death sentence case.
Khalid Barnes was then convicted of killing two drug dealers, but he was sentenced to life imprisonment, in September 2009.
In 1953 there was a final death sentence in New York. Juluis and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple, were executed, after being convicted of Soviet Union riots during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were killed in a powered chair, on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, from Oozbékistan, did not show remorse after the days and months after the attack, as the court reports.
He told the police who questioned him that he was pleased with what he had done.
Saipov told the authorities that he was forced to do the attack after watching ISIS video on his phone, according to his conviction letter.
He also asked that ISIS have a picture in his hospital room.
He said he was not guilty of the 22 charges mentioned to him.
David Patton, one of Saipov's lawyers, said that they are αdes of hope - in the decision of the prosecutors.
Patton also said: \"The case will be much longer to confuse everyone involved, since the prosecutors have decided to demand the death sentence, that the person simply does not accept the one who has confessed his guilt, and will be in prison for the rest of his life, and will never be released.
Saipov's defenders asked the prosecutor not to ask for a death sentence.
The European Union's exit proposal says NIGEL FARAGE should not be considered to lead the European Union's exit agreement
Nigel Farage said in the protest of the European Union's stay discussion, he has to ‘call the public' today.
This former Ukip leader says that politicians should ‘feel great enthusiasm' from those who do not want to join the European group.
Peter Bone, a traditionalist, said that the English demand for Birmingham would be gone, if Mr. Farage was the editor of the European Union's resignation.
But Mr. May was a serious problem with the reconciliation of its supporters, as some of them became with opposition to the Exodus from other European Unions.
The prime minister is struggling to be reasonable, as they are all attacking them who want to leave the European Union and those who want to stay there, and the European Union.
His supporters say that he should always be able to agree with Bruxelles, despite having been in trouble, and that those who do not like European groups and groups of workers will be forced to choose whether to accept their views, or to find a 'disruption.'
Mr. Bone told the Leavers during the Solishall movement, that he wanted the pros of the prime minister to be 'possessed.'
He said that Mr. Farage should be taken by a friend, and that the deal with Bruxelles should be arranged.
He said: 'We will now get out of the European Union, if I have taken care of it.'
Wellingborough supporters also said: 'I'm going to support the resignation of the European Union, but we have to get rid of the pros.'
He said, against the European Union: 'We have not been born during the major wars.
We want to be the only ones who set the law for our land.
Mr. Bone rejected the idea that people may have changed after the 2016 election. 'It is not true that the British people have changed their opinion, and they want to stay in the European Union.
Andrea Jenkyns, an advocate of the European Union, was also at the strike and said: 'This is all I say: Listen to the people, Prime Minister.
'Most people don't like those who don't want to change, the Opposition doesn't vote for it, our party and our protesters don't like it, they go to the streets, and vote for us first.
Don't follow those who don't want to change, listen first.'
This is his message to Rtoa May: 'The prime minister is held in his office when he keeps his word.'
Mr. Farage told the protesters that they should 'feel the heat' if they wanted to turn the decision into a referendum in 2016.
'When it touches us — the people — and the politicians,' he said.
'They want to turn the exit into the European Union, but here we're telling them 'we won’t let you do that.'
This is what he told the sincere people: 'I like politicians who want to turn the European Union out if you're going to do — feel the heat--
'We're calling on a large number of people in our midst, because they're what made us decide to leave the European Union. We're not going to stay if Grande-Bretegne is not a independent country, a special leader, and he's proud.'
The pro-secutors of the European Union made their way through Birmingham before a two-hour movement in the center of the city.
Protesters brought a banner to say they wanted to stay in the European Union.
Mr. Adonis, of the Workers' Party, mocked the conservatives of the party's computer security issue at the beginning of the discussion.
He said: ‘These are the people who tell us that they can set up an information program and technology for Canada, for war on the border, and for non- border trade for Ireland.'
'This is a bad piece.
There is no such thing as going out peacefully with the European Union,” he says.
Warren is thinking of ‘look forward' to the presidential candidate'
US Secretary Elizabeth Warren says that he will take a close look at the presidential election, after the November election.
The Boston Globe newspaper says that the Massachussets Democrat spoke about the future, during their discussion at the city hall.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump in November, will go to court again to compete with the President Geoff Diehl, who was a member of Trump's campaign administrator in Massachusets in 2016.
Many have thought he could compete with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday evening in Holyoke was his 36th meeting, using the way to fight the mayor's election, after Trump took power.
One of those present asked him if he was about to qualify as president.
Warren replied that this is the time — for women to go to Washington to repair the wrongs of our conduct, and there should be a woman in the head of the regime —

Grand Prix Russia: Lewis Hamilton became a world owner, when the judge said he won Sebastian Vettel.
This was not clear when Valtteri Bottas was able to play before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, and the Mercedes team decided that he would play a large part in the race.
Bottas was well off, and after Hamilton, he defended his position during the first two rounds, inviting Vettel to visit his friend.
Vettel was the first to stay in the factory, and allowed Hamilton to go, but it changed a lot.
Mercedes were slow from the construction, and then after Vettel. But first, Hamilton got along the same line, because the Ferrari driver was hesitant, leaving the road out of it, unable to defend his position in the third corner.
Max Verstappen is from the end, and is the seventh at the end of the first round, at the age of 21.
He then led most of the race, and held it until the end, and interviewed Kimi Raikkonen, who became a fourth.
He went to the construction of the 44th round, but could not increase his speed in the last eight rounds, so Raikkonen took the fourth.
This was difficult because Valtteri fought hard this weekend, and he left me there, according to the man's words.
The team did a lot of good - said Hamilton.
This Is a Realistic Act
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during the Saturday protests, as Feinstein asserted that he did not publish a secret letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Brett Kavanaugh, who may have been appointed a high judge for committing sexual crimes.
The president spoke during the West Virginie movement, but did not directly speak of Ford's words before the Secretary of the Court, but he said that it is — some wicked and lying — in view of what took place in the Senate.
\"The things which have happened in the assembly are lovely and pleasant, when you see the wrath, when you see the angry, the wicked, and the lying;
\"When you see what she's published and her secrets, she's back saying \"I didn't do that.\"
I didn't do that -
Do you remember?
Did you reveal the secret to Dianne Feinstein?
Remember his reply... Did you publish these letters? ¿Ah, what?
Not at all.
I didn't do that -
How so?
Did we reveal the secret...A a, we didn't do that, - he said, about the senator.
Feinstein received a letter in July, explaining ford's accusation of Kavanaugh, and published this letter in September, but Feinstein said that his office did not publish the secret.
\"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's word, and I didn't publish his story,\" Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
- We told me to keep it confidential, that I did nothing about it.
The president said that the ban was not valid, however, in his speech on Saturday night. — It was a very wrong move.
He probably didn't do it, but his actions were the worst thing I've ever seen —
The president defends the potential high judge, even though three women accuse him of committing sexual crimes against them, the president says the Democratic political tool is making these charges.
- They are ready to support their ideas in every way.
You see the evil spirit, they don't care what they hurt or blame them for their power and control, - according to the president reported by the Mediate.

Another black man?!
A child organizer from NEW YORK witnessed evading people after the post — a child organizer from NEW YORK
A New York child organizer is preaching to a couple because of the racist dismissal when he received a misspelled letter from the mother complaining that someone else was black —
The couple refuse to be racist and the complaint is equal to kidnapping -
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who caused two, expressed frustration when he found that the new child organizer Giselle Maurice was black on his first day in 2016.
“SURRECTED TO HORRY,” writes Mrs. Plasco-Franman to her husband.
In any case, if she should have sent it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice's wife two times.
When the Plasco-Flanman — who is not alive — felt that she had been ostracized by Maurice, the former African-American baby raiser said she had failed her job and looked forward to Filipinos, according to the New York Post.
Maurice's salary was paid on the day he worked and was sent home on it.
Maurice is now preaching to the couple to finance her expulsion and looks forward to a payment of 350 dollars a day for six months, the first job to prepare her without any agreement.
\"I want to show them that you don't do something like that,\" she said to the Post on Friday, adding: \"I know that it’s racism.
The couple responded to the claim of being a racist and said that the end of Maurice’s work was what he was supposed to do, because they were afraid they would not trust him after he was raised.
- My wife sent something she didn’t want to say to her to say to her — . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
He is not a racist.
We're not prejudiced, says his wife, Joel Plasco, at the Post.
\"Why do you put your children in the hands of people you didn't respect, even if it wasn't a spirit of superstition?
Your newborns?
Where?
Plasco, which equates the lawsuit with the — kidnapping — said that her husband had only two months of birth and was in a difficult place —
- Would you like to find someone like that?
It’s not very nice to do that — the bank employee says.
While the case is still in progress, the public is quick to criticize couples on social networks, beating them for their behavior and culture.
Paddington's editors were worried that readers would not understand the speech bear, as the new text stated
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the text: \"It is difficult to sit in a person's place before he is released.
It is very exciting to know what we know today about Paddington’s great success —
He says that his father, who worked as a BBC photographer before he was inspired to write the book for the children through a small toy pair, may have been bored by the rejection of his job, the 60th year of the publication of the books — a year after his death last year, he added to his words.
In connection with Paddington, which is a territory — an important part of the family, he added that his father was proud of his final success.
\"He is a man of little speech, and not a self-defense,\" he says.
- Well because Paddington is real, it's like you have a child who can do something: you are proud of them even if you didn't.
I think this is how he saw Paddington's success.
Despite these things and their thoughts, Paddington has always made a name for it
My daughter left home and I had to say hello on the phone
On arriving, her daughter was rushed to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctor was just working in vain to save her life.
—Nad kept calling that his journey was so bad, saying he didn’t expect to do it,” said Mrs. Edna-Laperouse.
(Maybe I received a call from Nad saying he would die within two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did so.
I said to him, \"Tashi, I love you very much, part of me.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that the doctor gave him to keep his heart active stopped and gradually withdrew from his body.
It was the day before he died that everything came to an end.
I just had to sit there, I knew it was all happening.
I could not scream or cry because in a situation of family and people.
I had to hold on to all of this.
At the end of Mrs. Edna-Laperouse, sad at the loss of her daughter, the plane went up with other passengers — forgetting the hard fight she had experienced.
\"No one knows\" he said.
- My head knelt down and tears streamed down my face for the rest of the day.
It is hard to explain that during the flight I felt this feeling of compassion for Nad that covered me.
He needs my love and my ability to live in his place.
I know he loves her very much.
A distressed woman has written a letter to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted letters on Welsh's bridge with messages of inspiration and telephone numbers that people could call for help.
Davis’s 13-year-old son, Tyler, began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
- I don't want anyone to feel what I feel every day,” she says.
Eighteen - year - old Davis, who lives in Lydney, says that his son is an enthusiastic cook who moved to the person who talked to him.
- He's known to everyone by his aunt -
They kept saying that their clicks explained the entire room —
However, he left his job before his death because he was in a very dark place —
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler's brother saw his brother only after he committed suicide.
She says: \"I always thought it would have an effect\"
My wife Davis created the letters — to let people know that there are people where you can go and talk to even if they are friends.
Don't sit in a quiet place — you need to talk —
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of her husband Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
He did not say that he felt discouraged or discouraged or something else, as he said.
- We saw a change in their actions two days before Christmas.
He was very excited on Christmas Day — he didn't see anyone, no matter what, when he opened up his giving to children —
He said his death was a terrible blow to them but they had to do something to get out of it: — It caused a hole in his family.
This led to our separation.
But we have to continue our lives and fight--

Brett Kavanaugh's future is risky because the FBI is beginning to investigate
- I thought if we could get something like what he asked — a time-limited investigation, in effect - we could be able to bring unity — Fleke said on Saturday, he said that he was worried about — an emergency — a committee in a path where there were no supporters to go.
Why is Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters unhappy with the FBI's investigation?
Their lack of enthusiasm is a matter of time.
The upcoming elections were only five weeks away, on November 6, - if the Republicans were not released, they would be weak as they tried to get the man they wanted to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush took a phone call to the Senator, encouraging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh who worked in His House for Mr. Bush and found his wife Ashley, Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI published its report?
A vote will be held at the Senate which includes 51 Republics and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is still unclear that at least 50 votes will be available in the National Assembly room of Kavanaugh, which will allow the Vice President Mike Pence to beat him and put himself in the Supreme Court.
In North Korea, the number of those who have joined the opposition has fallen under Kim
The number of North Koreans who moved to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, who quoted data from the South Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that there was an evacuation of 1127 protesters last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the main reason for this was the stronger surveillance on the border between North Korea and China and the higher cost of smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made a special public comment.
Most of the people who move from the north are finally given South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 300,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally.
Most are fleeing from China, which has the longest border between North Korea and is more easily connected than the DMZ-free zone between the two Koreas.
China considers the migrants to be illegal immigrants and often force them back.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is still in conflict in the context of the dictionary has been noted — in recent months.
Earlier this month two country leaders met in Pyongyang to talk about the preventable agreement on the cease - building of the New World Cup.
This was after a historic meeting in June with US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, after agreeing with the general effort to reach the unnuclear Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress ever since.
\"If there is no trust in ETAZONIA, our country's security will not be safe and in this situation there is no idea that we will disarm our first weapon\" — Mr. Ri, in his talk at the New York Convention.
Nancy Pelosi says that she can't work in the Supreme Court.
The head of the Vice Parliament, Nancy Pelosi, called the α-small ααααααααααααααααας, said that he did not have the right to work in the Supreme Court if he looked at himself.
Pelosi made that comment during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
- I can't think that if a woman did so, they said they'd be \"as if a little fool\" — Pelosi said about her actions in front of Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Secretary's Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh enthusiastically denied the claims that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were being harassed
In his first words, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and shouting during a discussion about his family and his third school education.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats of the committee, calling for his accusation of being \"astonished with mass killings\" which was prepared by liberals angry for Hillary Clinton's failure in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi claimed that he believed that his testimony was evidence of Kavanaugh's inability to work in the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was on his side against democracy.
He said: \"I think it's the only one who has done his best with these statements, the same way he persecuted Clinton's pro-Clinton and Democrats--
Pelosi was skeptical when asked if the Democrats would be suspicious of the reality of Kavanaugh's demise if he was gone, and if the Democrats were to reach the majority in the National Assembly.
\"This is what I'm going to say - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only in the Supreme Court but also in the current court,” Pelosi says.
Kavanaugh is a D.C current judge Cour d'Appel Fédérale.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decision against the Affordable Care Act (Absals of Health Care) or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered to be the judge of the traditionalist.
Upon hearing him confirm the situation, Kavanaugh ba left questions about how he might reverse the decisions of some of the Supreme Court.
- This is not the time when stupid people go to court and expect us to say, - isn’t that nice? - Pelosi says.
And women need to use it.
This is a very real woman, months and years of anger are falling and we can’t get out without crying.
- We cried when we were angry - Steinem told me 45 years later.
- I don't think it's unusual, and you're--
She added: “A woman who is a catre is very helpful to me who says she also cried when she was angry, but has developed a plan that means that when she is angry and started crying, she says to the person she was talking to: \"You may think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry -
And he continued on his journey
And I thought it was really bright.
Tears can be sent as a stir for anger in part, as people cannot understand their content.
One of the most memories I had when I started working in a man's office, where once I wept so much out of utter anger, to receive my older sister with my hips — the bad director always terrorized me — dragged me to the stage.
\"Don't let them see you weeping,\" she says to me
He does not realize that you are angry.
They think you are sad and will be happy because they have reached their goal.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic deputy to the Colorado Congress, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential career.
In 1987, after being caught up with other couples outside the marriage in a boat called Monkey Business Andri Hart, Mrs. Schroeder, felt that she had no reason to be president.
- It wasn't a well-thought decision,” she told me 30 years later.
\"There were seven candidates on the contest, and the last thing he needed was another candidate.
Someone called it \"Blanche Neige and Seven People\"
As the campaign went, he was cut off from the collection, vowing he would not enter the competition unless he could raise $2 million.
It was a war without success.
He found that some of his supporters who gave 1,000 dollars to men gave him only $250.
- Do they think I'm getting less of a price - he asks himself.
When the speech announced that he would not make an official campaign, he was overcome by emotion - the gratitude of the people who supported him, the resentment of the system that caused the money and determination of voters rather than the representatives to be difficult, and the anger over discrimination as a man or a woman - he was very old.
You may have thought that I was overwhelmed by feelings of despair — Mr. Schroeder recalls how the journalists reacted to him.
You may have thought Kleenex was a company that encouraged me
I remember what I thought they would do on my grave?

How to make a business war between the US and China an advantage for Beijing
The disintegration of weapons in the trade war between ETAZONIA and China has been heard, and if the war is not over, the damage that divides the countries may be good for Beijing long, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning early this year by charging for the great Chinese export, including a map of solar power, iron and alimioma.
This week's biggest rise with a new tax of 200 billion (150 £ billion), costing half of all China's goods coming into ETAZONIA.
Beijing responded every time he went, and in recent times he placed five to ten per cent of $60 billion in US goods.
China has promised to connect ETAZONIA's shot-for-shot, and the second largest economy in the world cannot be expected to be bright soon.
The withdrawal of Washington meant a delay in the face of demands, but the worship in the face of the US was a real problem for China’s president Xi Jinping.
However, experts have suggested that if Beijing's play is right, the American pressure in the trade war can support China in a lasting way by reducing the dependence on both economies.
\"The ability to make quick political decisions in Washington or Beijing to create the conditions that start economic decline in one country is even more dangerous than that which is actually accepted by observers\" says Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of researchers.
Syria is 'ready' to restore refugees, says the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the volunteers to return and call for help to rebuild a country that has been lost in the long-term war for seven years.
When the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem spoke to the United Nations Assembly, the country said the situation was improving.
- Unfortunately, the local situation is more peaceful and secure than the development of the anti-terrorism war,” she says.
The government continues to restore the scene of terrorists to rehabilitate the law.
All the conditions needed for the volunteers to return to the countries they have left due to terrorism and the economic conditions that are running out of their daily lives and livelihoods are already there.
THE FIRENENA estimates that more than 5,5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need help from seekers to improve human identity.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild the broken country.
But he insisted that he would not accept the provisions of the countries that supported the rebellion.

The USA Team fought hard at the end of the week looking for a football stadium other than Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-level golf during the entire break.

We've had a little bit of Europe this morning.
We gave up.

You must smoke.
They got us under control.
