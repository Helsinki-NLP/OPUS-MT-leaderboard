The practice was well - known, but it soon became apparent that the legs of a wooden chariot had come to a standstill.
Eventually, the feet of the chariots were replaced by the feet of the iron chariot, which took place in 1767, with the first route of an iron chariot.
For the first time in the journey, people started to live straight two million years ago at the Homo Erectus (a straight standing man).

Traffic Flow is a study of traffic between drivers and vehicles in two countries and in contact with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to check the traffic because the driver’s attitude is beyond comprehension.
However, drivers have a number of routines; hence, traffic is smooth and complicated.
