The blade of the modern ice skate has a double edge with a concave hole in the middle of them, and the two edges allow for a better grip of the ice, even if it is tilted.
Because under the blade the curve is small, when the blade turns to one side or the other, the edge that touches the ice also curves.
This is the reason for the skater’s rotation, when skates turn right, the skater turns right, if the skates turn left, the skater also turns left.
