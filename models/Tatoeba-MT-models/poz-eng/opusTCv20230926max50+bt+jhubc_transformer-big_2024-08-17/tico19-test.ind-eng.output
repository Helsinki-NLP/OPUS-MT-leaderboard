Cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly increasing in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, although the stages vary depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase its readiness for a surge in COVID-19 patients who will require health care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent of the disease is a new coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that about 80<0x25> of COVID-19 sufferers have a mild illness, namely a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these sufferers cured.
In about 14<0x25> of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease and requires hospital care, while another 6<0x25> of cases experience a critical illness that requires intensive care.
Mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4<0x25>.
In this study, we examined the cumulative incidence trends of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to incidents in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 experienced a further geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following the dynamics of the pandemic in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with confirmed COVID-19 cases based on WHO case definitions.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected across 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with that date including, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative figures and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases notified of each country worldwide is updated daily at 8:00 p.m. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK, as well as compare them to trends in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculate the cumulative incidence of a 14-day layoff, so take into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, in the period 1 January-15 March 2020.
We also present a cumulative number of cases notified by each country until March 15, 2020 at 8.00 p.m. compared to Italian cases during the period January 31–March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day cumulative incidence trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February, then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
This trend is mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a trend of a similar increase in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Additional materials).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data highlights that, as of March 15 at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 signaled that the pandemic was increasing at a comparable pace in all countries.
This is despite the differences in stages that countries experience, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and differences in protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region explained the situation of about 10<0x25> of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units at the EU/EAA level are only available for 6<0x25> and 1<0x25> of cases respectively (data are not shown).
However, the data should be collected in a systematic way to supplement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed great variation in the availability of intensive care beds and mid-careers in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries could have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and mid-care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The health care capacity saturation modelling scenario, with estimates of the prevalence of inpatient COVID-19 cases for each EU/EEA and UK countries at risk <0x3E>90<0x25> beyond intensive care bed capacity, was provided in the ECDC’s sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since so far cases have been classified in certain regions of the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a specific regional service coverage population, information about cases and intensive care beds is best provided at the Regional Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing very quickly in the EU/EEA and UK.
Therefore, states, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for a community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, particularly intensive care, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in the ECDC’s recent rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive, and comprehensive approach is critical to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, because a rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give decision-makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept, and adapt the appropriate response if not previously applied.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity as the country has the possibility to further increase its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing the pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEA country's health care system is likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disaster for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is more contagious and more about the elderly than young people, as well as more in men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly growing subject of research.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
While there are still many unanswered questions, we hope this review helps understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were ordered to stay home during the holidays and a few weeks afterwards due to an outbreak of new viral diseases.
The virus is very homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients repatriated and 3,000 patients dead.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number 1 enemy of the public” and has the potential to be more destructive than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that established virus sequences isolated from several patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, which include its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to summarize the research progress in this fast-growing new subject area.
If possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-caused diseases, namely Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far regarding the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some other unanswered, but urgent questions.
According to tradition, CoV is considered a nonletal pathogen for humans, mainly causing about 15<0x25> of colds.
However, in this century, we have encountered a highly pathogenic CoV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing outbreaks that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, a pneumonia cluster of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infections of health care providers were reported, which hinted that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, a region quarantine was imposed in the city of Wuhan and all public transport was halted.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients who came into direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market were considered to be the initial site of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).
As the situation developed very quickly, the final coverage and severity of the outbreak still had to be established.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study on 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more updated picture of the following epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but especially in the age of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7<0x25>) of infected people are over 50 years old, only a few are under 20 years old, and only 14 are infected are under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100000) than women (0.27/100000).
COVID-19 is widespread in the cluster, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from start to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base reproduction rate (R0) is 3.77 (95<0x25> CI: 3.51-4.05) and the customized R0 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, according to massive transportation times before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality of patients with confirmed cases is 1.44<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 1.10-1.86<0x25>) and customized mortality for all patients is 3.06<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 2.02-4.59<0x25>).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (men), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a large, envelope subfamily of viruses containing a single strand of RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein bulge or spike (S) envelope binds to its cell receptor, the angiotensin-exchange enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by cover glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form vesicles containing virions, which then undergo fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98<0x25> genetic similarity among the 10 samples that were sequenced; the sample was taken from the outbreak's home site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles are found in the very thin epithelium of the human airway.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S SARS-CoV-2 protein binds to human ACE2 weaker than its binding to the S SARS-CoV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are not as severe as SARS-CoV infections in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded with orf3b and proteins secreted with orf8 codes.
The orf3b protein SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has an open and closed conformation, is composed of dimers and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which is evidence for the introduction and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Mother of origin and intermediaries
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and are each transmitted to humans through ferrets and camels.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96<0x25> identical to the two SARS-like CoVs of bats called bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, the intermediate host that helps the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans is still unknown, and the transmission route still has to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed snakes as carriers of viruses from bats to humans involving homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that the pangolin, an ant-eating long snout mammal often used in traditional Chinese medicine, could potentially be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99<0x25> genetic homology to CoV found in the pangolin and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, the 1<0x25> difference spread across the genome is still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence are still not obtained (Gbr. 3).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40<0x25>-50<0x25> humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75<0x25> ethanol, disinfectants containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, effectively disable the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other previous CoV studies, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).
In general, after invading the host, the virus is recognized by the innate immune system through pattern recognition receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and type I interferon synthesis (IFN) which restricts the spread of the virus and accelerates viral antigen phagocytosis by macrophages.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid the immune response.
Soon, an adaptive immune response joins in the battle against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
Nevertheless, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from cured patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce large amounts of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to lungs and other organs, and, at worst, compound organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by an onset cluster, is more about the elderly with accompanying diseases and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of being infected than others.
Estimates of the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 are 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, show that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent an infected person, but without symptoms, from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people exposed to the virus or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and early symptoms of COVID-19, with or without accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, diarrhea, headache, sore throat, nausea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the progression of the patient's disease progresses rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or acute respiratory and fever symptoms, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened against the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98<0x25> for fever, 76<0x25> for dry cough, 55<0x25> for dyspnea, and 3<0x25> for diarrhea; 8<0x25> of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, namely studies on family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
Comparatively, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98<0x25>), dry cough (47<0x25>), and dyspnea (55<0x25>) as their main symptoms.
However, 80<0x25> of patients need ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher MERS lethality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26<0x25>) and sore throat (21<0x25>) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99<0x25>-100<0x25>), dry cough (29<0x25>-75<0x25>), dyspnea (40<0x25>-42<0x25>), diarrhea (20-25<0x25>), and sore throats (13-25<0x25>) are shown as the main symptoms and ventilation support is required for about 14<0x25>-20<0x25> of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was at 2<0x25> with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Comparable to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 amounted to 10<0x25> of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality accounted for 37<0x25> of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached as high as 6.47 with confidence intervals (CI) 95<0x25> at 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
The figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spreading ability than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as lethal as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Classified starters are often found in one family or from one gathering or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a travel history or stay in Wuhan or other affected areas or come in contact with an infected person or patient in the last two weeks before the onset.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who are discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again. This raises caution to increase quarantine time.
In the early stages, the patient has a normal or decreased count of peripheral white blood cells (specifically lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, which includes lymphocyte count <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase and viremia levels were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin increase in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive protein and blood-staining rate increase in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, D-dimer levels increase, i.e. fibrin decomposition products present in the blood, and lymphocyte count decreases progressively.
thoracic photo abnormalities are found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral cloudy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly aggravate gas exchange disorders.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunctions lower surfactant levels and increase surface pressure thus lowering the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the worst findings on thoracic photos are often in parallel with the most severe disease rates.
On 18 February 2020, the first COVID-19 pathological analysis showed pneumocyte desquamation, the formation of hyalin membranes, and the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as multiple syntial cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, in accordance with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS and similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high level of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer rely solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurs in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a must to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the protocol for using the SHERLOCK-based CRISPR technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a dip stick in less than one hour.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors primarily offer supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or proposed previously for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current therapies and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from cured patients is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threats to the patient and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of heart failure or life-threatening breathing.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
An overreaction of the immune system is known to result in cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response marked by the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and failure of compound organs.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storms include T cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF blocking; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signaling suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are useless for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Conversely, steroids can result in severe side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which greatly affects the prognosis.
However, short-dose to moderately low doses of corticosteroids is recommended to be given with caution to critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, was found to be beneficial in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition against other single-stranded RNA viruses, which include MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provides this compound for China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side reactions can occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other drugs that the patient uses should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and the manufacture of antibodies
There is a long history of blood collection of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting the disease.
Indeed, patients who have recovered often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) that produce B lymphocytes to fight pathogens as well as other foreign bodies, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammation and viral load as well as increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification need to be made to submit the method for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some deficiencies related to plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
Antibody concentrations in the blood are usually low and plasma is needed in large quantities to treat critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to counter a global epidemic is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or perform effective antibody screening against proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula. This formula varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, because effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 do not yet exist, TCM is becoming one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du's capsule and Lian Hua Qing Wen's capsule were found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The top recovery rates in COVID-19 patient therapy were observed in some Chinese provinces using TCM in 87<0x25> of its patients, which included Gansu (63.7<0x25>), Ningxia (50<0x25>), and Hunan (50<0x25>), while Hubei province, which uses TCM in only about 30<0x25> of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13<0x25>).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing western drug therapy alone with WM and TCM combined therapy.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, symptom loss, and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
More impressively, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was much lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4<0x25> compared to 46.2<0x25>) and lower mortality in the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8<0x25> compared to 39<0x25>).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM is still awaiting better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanism of work and clarify effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most patients who suspected or confirmed COVID-19 felt very fearful of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and the quarantined person also felt boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Further, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as therapeutic side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to greater anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor turmoil, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality were ever reported.
Contact history tracking and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and feel guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, and persons in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and therapeutic plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for breaking down transmission chains from the reservoirs of infected animals and humans to vulnerable hosts and often complement antiviral therapy in control of epidemics caused by the emergence of viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which in the long term and effectively makes neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in experimental animals.
However, the efficacy of the vaccine in vivo candidates in the elderly and the model of the latent challenge and its protection against zoonotic viral infections remains to be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and have been partially evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that is safe and effective for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easily overcome due to the long time to develop the vaccine (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic CoV variation.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show its full clinical journey in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can gradually heal without sequela.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the establishment of a disease prognosis model is essential for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs in 30-65 years of age with 47.7<0x25> of patients over the age of 50 in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who require intensive care tend to have comorbidities and complications and are significantly older than patients who do not require intensive care (the median age of 66 years versus 51 years), which suggests age as a prognostic factor for the final outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care have a greater chance of having acute heart injury and arrhythmias.
Heart disease is also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to also bind to collangiocytes with ACE2-positive, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases are highly correlated and can affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammatory or tissue injury and are proposed as potential prognostic factors for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
A correlation between CRP levels and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the final outcome.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Photos of thoracic and developmental temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict the final outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are widely used as supportive therapies for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of the disease end up suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and short durations in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer from tremendous stress as they have to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be provided to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, in the early phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which poses great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most do not occur in the early stages.
As such, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
At present, major efforts are being made in China, which includes quarantines of the Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as ongoing quarantines of almost the entire population in the hope of stopping the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although this action is severely damaging to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate states the outbreak will end in March and the downturn phase lasts 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. created a model to predict the final outcome of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-concave swab and throat of patients who had recovered and returned home from hospital 2 weeks earlier. This indicates that the re-identified virus can be a recurrent episode, similar to influenza.
However, promising signs occur in China, based on a decline in the number of new cases, indicating that the current strategy may work.
Ebola is predicted to cause one million cases with half as many deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
It may also be that, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually dissipate or become a less pathogenic virus that can coexist with humans.
Comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS epidemics are given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also be through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in feces, giving rise to the possibility of new transmission, namely fecal-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41<0x25> of cases may be caused by nosocomial infection, which includes 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions should be taken to protect people, particularly health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and even people who happen to come into contact with an infected patient or person.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of face masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (serial number 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks keep the spit of a potentially infected person out of the air or attached to the surface of the material, where the spit can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5<0x25> of virions being able to completely neutralize; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both measuring about 85 nm.
Since particles can magnetize even five surgical masks stacked into one, health care providers who come in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (serial number 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may enter his body through inflammation of the eye.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear a translucent face shield or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in the affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended for everyone to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay home for self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
The three-foot distance is believed to be appropriate to keep the distance from the patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a major warning to China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control calms the population by saying that the new virus has low transmission properties and limited human-to-human reproductive capacity and prevention and containment of the disease is not a problem.
This message soothes the public’s fears, especially as the whole country is preparing for the Spring Festival, that this critical time is missed to stem the still-small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The disease control agency in China should take lessons from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by residents and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics than waiting for official reports from doctors or officers in authority; (3) more restrictive to stem the potential of epidemics at an early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more frequent targeted and effective exercise of public awareness and epidemics.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to spread in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, the outbreak has spread throughout China and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of writing this review.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, the COVID-19 outbreak gives the impression of a recurring SARS outbreak.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial to stem the epidemic and deal with patients.
COVID-19 is more about the elderly than it is for young people and more about men than it is for women, and the mortality rate is also higher in the elderly than it is for young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91<0x25> versus 1.44<0x25>).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomless, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill. This makes it a greater difficulty in curbing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part the reason SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA tests to check for SARS-CoV-2 can have negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can again give positive results against the examination of the virus.
These findings greatly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, several important issues remain to be resolved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96<0x25> of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoV bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animals are intermediate species to transmit the virus from the original host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off transmission and the outbreak can recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical asia suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and result in subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does a virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic be a worldwide pandemic, ending like SARS, or repeated periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
However, at any price, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
Zoonotic origin of human corona virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as a cold.
An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the situation and revealed how HCoV infection can be highly destructive and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought the CoV back into the spotlight and surprised us with its high transmission, but with lower pathogenicity than its sibling, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic. Therefore, understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoV will benefit us.
Most HCoVs come from bats. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
Inang reservoir intermediates of several HCoVs have also been known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Research into CoV-innate interactions in animals can also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present a general overview of the current knowledge of the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of its discovery as well as its zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compared and contrasted the HCoV from the point of view of evolution and genome recombination.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements of successful host transition and the implications of viral evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of sheathed, positive, and single-stranded RNA viruses.
The virus has the largest genome measuring 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called "CoV", due to its crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that have similar structuring.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open read frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap each other. Both are transcribed into polyprotein replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins undergo further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open read frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes a bulge or spike (S), a sheath or envelope (E), a membrane (M), and a nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complementary proteins specific to a particular lineage are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among those four genera, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoV and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while poultry are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory infections in relatively more patients and have a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside of the lung organ.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the snotty snort of patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, the concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is generally harmless, until an outbreak of SARS occurs.
The SARS outbreak of 2003 is one of the most destructive outbreaks in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a rough mortality rate of about 10<0x25>.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to various other parts of the world.
The new HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), further called SARS-CoV-2, is a causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has gone off and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origin from bats, mice, or pets.
Much evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats. In bats, CoVs are well-adapted and nonpathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges to China and the rest of the world.
The zoonotic origin tracking of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and limiting factors of migration between species.
The study may also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediates, and SARS-CoV-2 amplifications, which have important implications in the prevention of future spread.
In this review, we provide a general overview of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We specifically highlight and discuss the general topic that the HCoV parent virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but becomes pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoV that increased transmission ability is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The final outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of the first HCoV-229E strain of B814 from the snort of patients affected by the cold, various CoVs had been isolated from various infected animals, which included turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative clue.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the airways of patients who had an upper airway infection in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 pulmonary cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed symptoms of a cold, which included headaches, sneezing, lethargy, and a sore throat, accompanied by fever and a cough seen in 10<0x7E>20<0x25> of cases.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and sequential series pathways in the still-feeding brain.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from other respiratory tract pathogenic infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and tend to be most transmitted during winter in temperate regions.
Usually, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week and is followed by a sick period of about 2 weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced mild colds.
Few patients with weakened immune systems show severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent was SARS-CoV, which was the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, which are spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the super-infectious, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load visible on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience mialgia, headache, fever, lethargy, and chills, which are followed by dyspnea, coughing, and breathing disorders as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Damage to alveolar diffusion, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages were also observed in SARS patients.
Furthermore, about 20-30<0x25> of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be deadly, particularly in patients with weakened immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of zero patients who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus is initially very prevalent in young children, the elderly, and patients whose immunity is weak who suffer from respiratory diseases.
Descriptions of choriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7<0x25> of common respiratory diseases and peaks in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called a crutch.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be associated with an acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
These four community HCoVs have entirely adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases. However, exceptional cases do occur for unknown reasons, as in the case of more virulent subtypes of HCoV-NL63 that have recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Generally, when it gets the ability to move efficiently and maintain itself in humans, the virulence and pathogenicity of HCoV is also reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of 60-year-old patients with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases are from the Middle East, cases of imports with occasional secondary spread to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to the clinical manifestations of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which has so far only occurred in MERS among diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30<0x25> of patients exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with high case deaths, at 34.4<0x25>, making MERS-CoV one of the scariest viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that an ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections is caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency as well as naming the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a violent case death rate of 3.4<0x25>.
Note, case deaths in Hubei, China, at 4.2<0x25>, while case deaths outside Hubei at 1.2<0x25>.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a picture of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of nucleotide sequences, at 82<0x25>, both cluster into different branches of phylogenetic trees.
The pathognosticity of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been reported and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows a general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture seen in Community HCoV infection, which includes a picture of mild or even symptomless nonspecific symptoms.
On the other hand, a small percentage of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infection even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting pattern characteristics, bearing similarities to both community HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission capability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community HCoV.
On the other hand, decreased transmission ability of SARS-CoV-2 after several pathways in humans still needs to be verified, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from fecal samples.
"Whether fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, it must still be clarified by subsequent studies."
What is also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoV.
However, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which includes the ability to transmit, pathogenicity, and sustainable spread across multiple pathways in humans, will have a profound impact on the eventual fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
Viewed from another perspective, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may be species that survived the ancient HCoV pandemic.
The HCoV that causes severe disease in humans and humans suffering from severe HCoV disease has been destroyed.
For this to happen, HCoV must replicate in humans in sufficient quantities to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations to counteract the host restriction factor.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community CoVs circulate in the human population and trigger a cold in immunocompetent people.
The virus does not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans and their transmission in humans is untenable.
Both must defend themselves and breed in zoonotic reservoirs and seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or several intermediate hosts and amplifications.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar image to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community HCoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted like a community HCoV, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoV and not as pathogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir animal host or intermediate.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and HCoV amplification hosts.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoV if they have a closely related ancestor and share a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
Ancestral viruses are usually well adapted and are nonpathogenic in this host.
Similarly, reservoir hosts carry HCoV sustainably and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is infected naturally and is a natural host for HCoV or the parent virus.
Conversely, if a new HCoV enters the intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters humans, the virus has not adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate mother can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplifying host by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate, then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV can develop a dead-end infection if it is unable to maintain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, intermediate hosts become natural reservoir hosts.
Epidemiological data reveals retrospectively that zero cases of SARS have a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies indicated that the animal seller had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Moonweed (Paguma larvae) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market were the first to be identified carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that there have been no more cases of SARS reported since all the ferrets on the market were killed.
Nevertheless, it was reported that moon ferrets from the wild or farms that were not exposed to the live animal market largely gave a negative test result for SARS-CoV. This signaled that moon ferrets may only act as intermediate amplifying hosts, but not a natural resorvoir of SARS-CoV.
It should be noted, since 80<0x25> of the various animals on the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that perhaps many small mammal species also serve as hosts of SARS-CoV intermediate amplifications.
All of these hosts appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
A subsequent natural animal host search for SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, called the CoV bat Rhinolopus relative-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
This bat gave positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
These CoVs and other bat CoVs share an 88-92<0x25> nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
This study became the foundation for a new concept that bats are hosts for newly emerging human pathogens.
Some SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV) were also identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, could be isolated as a live virus.
The angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from a sample of bat feces was shown to use ACE2 bats, ferrets, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, a convalescent SARS patient serum can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, with a nucleotide sequence homology of 95<0x25>.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the direct reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bat and CoV-HKU5 bat.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the viral entrance.
The RNA polymerase-dependent RNA sequence MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to its counterpart in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87<0x25> of nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab camels provide seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like camels of Middle Eastern origin in some African countries.
MERS-CoV living identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal cusp of Arab camels. This further indicates that the camel is the actual reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with usually mild symptoms is observed in test camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted, infected camels shed the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of viral decay from bats.
However, the question remains unanswered because many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or an unknown transmission route involving unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2<0x25> nucleotide homology with the RaTG13 bat CoV isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to establish a parent relationship.
In other words, the bat may not be a direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2, unless an almost identical CoV of the bat is found later in life.
Likely, the intermediate animal host SARS-CoV-2 was among the species of wildlife sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are related to this market, which indicates the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequences suggest that a small group of endangered mammals, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), may also carry ancestral beta-CoVs that are related to SARS-CoV-2.
This new pangolin CoV genome shares 85-92<0x25> of nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is as closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of 90<0x25> at the nucleotide sequence level.
The two are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like virus-like subunits in a phylogenetic tree, one sharing a receptor binding domain (RBD) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4<0x25>.
Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs are much different, although the degree of genome-wide sequence homology is higher.
Previous studies on sick pangolins also reported detection of viral contig from pulmonary samples, which turned out to be also related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different methods of drafting and manual curation to produce partial genome sequences consisting of about 86.3<0x25> of complete viral genomes.
We cannot rule out the possibility of pangolins as one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from pangolins due to the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the relative beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals has yet to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 pangolin, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology at the entire genome sequence level.
It is too speculated if it is said that the high level of similarity between RBD beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The counter hypothesis supports recombination between the beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving factor, recombination occurs a lot among beta-CoV.
Researchers have yet to decide on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoV, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American three-colored bats showed close kinship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, under the name Hipposideros/Ghana Kwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae thought to also be its intermediate host.
To be clear, the current knowledge of the animal origin of HCoV is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of HCoV interspecies transmission in history.
In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed the species from livestock to infect humans, there was a pandemic of respiratory infections.
The history of transmission of HCoV-229E between species is not very clear.
Alfa-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between the two, there is alpha-CoV alpaka.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may come into contact with bats in shared ecological niches.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Second, alpha-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E are diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV alpaca causes outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Lastly, alpha-CoV alpaka is not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaca getting alpha-CoV relative-HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source for human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility is that, while alfa-CoV bats serve as a gene loop for HCoV-229E, Arab alpakas and camels may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at initial identification of the virus and is also reinforced with subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are rich in viral species for interspecies genetic fragment exchange and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, tightly arranged colonies, close social interaction, and strong flying ability, are all favorable conditions for bats to become ideal 'spreaders of the virus'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arabian camel for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have changed from intermediate hosts to stable, natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans occurred by chance and humans remained the final host for MERS-CoV because the transmission could not be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Especially, beta-CoV pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
The pangolin may be the final host for the SARS-CoV-2 relative beta-CoV-2, similar to the weasel in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animal to human should be taken into account or ruled out.
First, bats could have been reservoir hosts for the SARS-CoV-2 relative virus which is nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological niches with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the pangolin could have been one of the intermediate amplifying hosts for the newly inked SARS-CoV-2 relative virus.
Humans get the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunted meat.
It is possible that many mammals, which include pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody surveys of pets and wild animals need to be conducted.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The original search for SARS-CoV-2 animals is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, the three main factors of the virus side are also important to facilitate CoV across the species barrier.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, estimates of CoV mutation rates can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 per year per site, depending on the CoV adaptation phase of the new host.
CoV has exoribonuclease correction, removal which results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, Remdesivir's nucleotide analogs are known to suppress CoV replication through the inhibition of this exoribunuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutations is about a million times higher than the rate of their host mutations.
In addition, mutation rates are often high when the CoV has not adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV which has a high mutation rate, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, suggesting a higher rate of adaptation with humans.
Likely, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts that are closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV that has adapted to Arab camels.
Theoretically, it is less likely that genetic drift will quickly make vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in the CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the probability of co-evolution between species, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by the abundance of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replication through a unique "choose-copy" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing vessel, strand transitions often occur during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Complete RNA and highly homologous subgenomics can undergo recombination to form a new CoV.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus-infection interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during the incidence of interspecies transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and ferrets, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptations in various hosts, particularly with mutations in the RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and intensively becomes the target of the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its correceptor as the viral entrance.
SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to recognize various animal ACE2 receptors, which include bats, ferrets, rats, and raccoons, thus enabling the transmission of viruses between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to differ between human and weasel virus isolates in RBD and 4 of them were located in receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV ferret has mutations K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of bulge protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptors as SARS-CoV.
A 30<0x25> difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies the binding affinity of protein S to human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed the binding affinity of human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV-2 proteins to be 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV proteins.
What is also important to know is whether there are any other choreceptors that may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after interspecies transmission from its animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the end result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also regulated by other host dependence and restriction factors.
These differences in host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arab camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoV must take over the host dependent factor and break down the host restriction factor in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, the molecular determinants in this important area of viral-innate interaction still have to be identified and characterized.
Filtering the entire unbiased genome to look at dependency factors and limiting SARS-CoV-2 hosts using state-of-the-art CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
The emergence of new HCoV: back to the beginning of the outbreak
The diversity of bat CoVs provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, the bat CoV serves as the gut of the HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein encoding gene has the potential to drastically modify the virus's phenotype.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans because isolated SARS-CoV bat virus was found to encode various ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with the characteristic removal of 29 nucleotides was found in strains isolated early in the human epidemic.
This deletion separates ORF8a into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that supports host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineages, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in RNA-dependent polymerases.
The recombination location was also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partly nsp14.
Similarly, recombination events between various lineages were shown to take place in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in Arabian camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoV undergoes recombination with other animal CoVs in its nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in involuntary changes in the viral genome, most likely resulting from the release of the virus from the selection pressure experienced, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain as a result of the removal of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca shows a single nucleotide insert that results in a skeletal shift.
Lastly, the evolution of the new HCoV is also driven by selection pressures in its reservoir hosts.
Mild or no symptoms are detected when the bat is infected with CoV, which indicates mutual adaptation between the CoV and the bat.
It seems that bats adapt well to CoV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a defect in the activation of the proinflammatory response in bats will decrease the CoV-triggered pathology efficiently.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to increased regulation of natural killer cell receptor inhibitors NKG2/CD94 and low level of expression of the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the bat's high metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and affect correction by exoribonuclease thus putting pressure on selection for the creation of highly pathogenic viral strains upon entry into the new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also develop through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of proteins or new protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoV is nonpathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
CoVs replicate strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
Here lies the secret of a carrier without symptoms and the cause of severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the activation of an overactive immune response as well as cytokine storms, with pulmonary damage getting heavier if the immune response gets stronger.
In contrast, in a carrier without symptoms, the immune response is already detached from CoV replication.
The same strategy for determining the linkage of immune responses may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
For this reason, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a general outline of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV bats that share 95<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there is also CoV bats that share 96<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although ferrets and other animals on the market were found to carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, a direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
A highly homologous beta-CoV pangolin with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which suggests that pangolin may play a role as either an intermediate host or beta-CoV may contribute a gene fragment to the late version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still in question, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans either intentionally or unintentionally.
CoV is back in the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs for HCoV on human transmission.
Very much evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 come from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and ferrets in wet markets, it may be the closure of the wet market and the killing of all ferrets in it that ended the SARS epidemic effectively.
For the same reason, pangolins should have been removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-CoV lineages of pangolins that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in the Arabian camel.
This camel serves as an important means of transportation as well as a major source for meat, dairy, leather, and wool products for the local community.
Arab camels are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we are unlikely to kill all camels to control MERS, as it is done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach must be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we can successfully eliminate this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause outbreaks.
Various zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, potentially zoonotic bat CoVs are very diverse.
There are many possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and undergo recombination, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China had to be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and coping plans must be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet since a long time ago.
These viruses are in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that support the spread of the virus, the chances of humans coming into contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from wild animals.
Sustainable surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is that humans must keep a distance from the ecological niche of the natural reservoir of zoonotic viruses.
Some parts of the zoonotic origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be discovered.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, conditions when bats and pangolins share ecological niches are important to know.
Second, if the bat has a more direct role in the transmission to humans, the way humans contact the bat should be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that acts as an actual intermediate host, the way the mammal interacts with other species, which include humans, bats, and pangolins should be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infections and surveillance should be performed.
Whether bats, pangolins, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical host can be identified in its natural host in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this field will outline the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updates to the diagnostic criteria of "expected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 need to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guide to the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide is based on our experience and serves as a good reference to fight the pandemic around the world.
Nevertheless, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, the strategy of diagnosis and treatment is also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we respond to one of the comments in our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for “specified cases” and “confirmed cases” based on the Diagnosis and Handling Guide to COVID-19 (the seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is currently formally called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing based on ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example the Diagnosis and Handling Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions with part of the context having been changed quite a lot.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide as well as being a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires an update based on the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Handling Guide (the seventh version of the trial) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case is required a combination of one epidemiological history picture with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or the fulfillment of three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or living in Wuhan city and surrounding area, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms of Wuhan city and surrounding area, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days;
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) features of imaging of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicates normal lymphocyte count, decreased, or decreased in the early onset stage.
Diagnosing a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a sequence of the entire viral genome showing high homogeneity for a new known coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum-specific Ig-CoV-2 testes; or an alteration of the virus genome-specific IgG-specific antibodies;
We can see that a real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in a sample of the respiratory tract or blood was added in the second edition (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; later, serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This modification is based on ongoing research by researchers to look for optimal nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the airways including blood retrieval, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the inclusion of certain positive antibody results into confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that reminds us to be wary of patients with atypical symptoms and without symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s flow chart should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in future practice and clinical studies.
In closing, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and ask readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "expected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend following and complying with the latest guidelines in their respective countries.
Our team will also update our guides periodically for help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of recorded cases of infection including 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases living at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41-50 years old.
He also said the two victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Road and Bridge Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be halted longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport cessation has begun since March 26 and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded incident of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, when two people who had just returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By 19 March, the three men had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection surpassed one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia suffered its first death from the coronavirus.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remains free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there have been more than 244,000 cases of the coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. from coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries are announcing stricter measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the region's quarantine until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russian citizens would remain paid without having to go to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend national emergency status by 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, ten votes abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to the entire day; previously, the curfew was only valid between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio governor, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia lower toilet paper purchase limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoons, the Woolworth and Coles Australian store chain each lowered the limits of toilet tissue purchases to two and one pack per transaction in all stores on a national level.
ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit, on Monday.
This restriction was announced as a message on the cashier and on his network's Facebook page.
Buyers are reportedly piling up supplies due to the fear of COVID-19 in case the public should conduct self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes followed the four pack per transaction restrictions previously applied Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
In his March 8 media statement, Coles reported that with the enactment of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still running out in an hour since delivery", and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unprecedented".
Sales "are rising sharply" last week, according to one Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco stores in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packaging from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers were trying to increase inventories, but local government agencies' restrictions on truck delivery times made it difficult.
It anticipates rising production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because it had taken off supplies earlier, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the store was filling up on a nightly basis.
He stressed that toilet tissue is a large volume of goods so that the amount of supplies is low and, if sold out, makes a lot of empty space on the shelves so that the scarcity of goods is increasingly felt.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and sanitation can [be bought] and exist in large numbers, panic may be minimised, Russel Zimmerman told ABC News.
Recycled toilet tissue manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were running out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleenex Toilet Wipes, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, stressed they were working 24/7 to keep supplies, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some property sellers are offering free toilet paper to the auction's first bidder in Melbourne, when fewer auctions are held as buyers take a break for the long Labor Day weekend break.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet tissue.
Shops are actually reluctant to implement the restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3, they said they do not plan to implement the purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitation, dry food, handwashing soap, and flour.
Also outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon British online supermarket Ocado was observed restricting the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak — a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — as a pandemic.
While the word "pandemic" refers only to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, the WHO notes the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the country detects, tests, handles, isolates and mobilizes its people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
We are very wary both because of the alarming rate of spread and severity as well as because of the alarming rate of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, “other than influenza, no respiratory tract virus has ever been tracked from its appearance to a sustained global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by coronavirus."
He continued, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status of the pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency that is troubling the world.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, “the bottom line is that this outbreak is going to get worse.”
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reports there are at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a World-Related Public Health Emergency on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
Case fatality rates are estimated to be 4<0x25> in China, while worldwide range from 13.04<0x25> to 0.08<0x25> in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is generally around five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatments are symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, mouth covering when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for people suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control, and facility closures.
The pandemic has caused severe global socioeconomic disruption, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports activities, and widespread shortages of goods exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed both at the national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there are incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with East and Southeast Asian ancestry and appearance, and people who come from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of travel reductions and heavy industry closures, air pollution and carbon emissions declined.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases are largely related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus and is related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to fall ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no apparent association with the then mentioned wet market cluster.
Among the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have links to those markets.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case that can be traced to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was likely the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with new cases reported declining in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has surpassed the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, particularly among people with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, a relatively small number of reported cases among youth, with people aged 19 and under making up 2.4<0x25> of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60<0x25> of the UK population needs to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
As of March 23, no country has yet tested more than 3<0x25> of its population, and many countries have made an official policy not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, through January 23, an estimated 86<0x25> of COVID-19 infections went undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79<0x25> of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is expected to be greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the basic reproduction rate (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure is likely to be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 have recovered.
For those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80<0x25> of deaths occur in people over the age of 60 and 75<0x25> have pre-existing health disorders, which include cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official death count due to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the person who died who gave positive test results for COVID according to the official protocol.
The actual fatality rate due to COVID-19 may be much higher, given the official figure likely excludes people who died without being tested, for example, at home, in care homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the excess number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged, "We know [the announced number of deaths] is lower than the actual figure", a statement corroborated by non-scientific reports of too low calculations in the U.S. Too low calculations often appear in pandemics, such as in the January 2020 H1N1 swine flu epidemic of 2009. The first confirmed deaths in Wuhan were
The first death outside of mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded respectively in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territorial territories have reported deaths, on every continent, except Antarctica. In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This figure varies by region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, handling options, time since the first outbreak, and the character of the population such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of deaths to cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death toll ratio was 6.0<0x25> (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the estimated ratio of deaths to cases decreased from 17.3<0x25> (for people with onset of symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7<0x25> (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measurements include case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed as having died from a particular disease, and specific infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people who are not infected (diagnos)
These statistics are timeless and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the infection fatality rate for the pandemic as a whole between 0.1<0x25> and 0.39<0x25>.
The upper limit of this forecast range is in line with the results of the first randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the assessment on CFR estimates.
WHO confirms that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end of the duration of these outbreaks are unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states, "Without control, infectious outbreaks are usually horizontal and then begin to decline as the disease runs out of available hosts.
However, it is almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at the moment about when it happened".
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "this outbreak might end June" if the entire country could be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene <0x26> Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly up to a year or two."
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (likely 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's less likely that this coronavirus, because it's so easily transmitted, can disappear entirely" and the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Virulence recurrence will depend on the immunity of the group and the mutation rate.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unspecific and an infected person can be without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88<0x25>) and dry cough (68<0x25>).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory sputum (flegma), loss of smelling power, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, headache, shivering, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing, chest distress or sedentary chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and bluishness on the face and lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms arise. Further disease development can be severe pneumonia, acute napasis syndrome, acute napasis, septic syndrome
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming the infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those in close contact with the confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and checked to make sure they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate an asymptomatic ratio ranging from a few to 44<0x25>.
The incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, the estimated number of COVID-19 sufferers who lose their sense of smell is initially 30<0x25>, then decreased to 15<0x25>.
Details on how the disease spreads are still being researched.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur primarily at close contact time and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that uncovered coughs could cause droplets to push 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that last longer in the air and are produced when speaking. Breathing droplets can also be produced when exhaling, including when speaking, although the virus is not generally transmitted through the air.
Droplets may fall on the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary cardiac resuscitation (RJP), can make respiratory secretions turn into aerosols and then spread through the air.
The spread can also occur when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through feces, the risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government rejects the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and at a further stage of the disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which indicates transmission may occur before the presence of significant symptoms.
Few reports of asymptomatic cases have been laboratory-confirmed, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that an infected person may have already touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed if exposed to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the early SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically classed with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B lineage) along with two bat derived strains.
The virus has a 96<0x25> similarity at the level of the entire genome to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a difference of one amino acid in certain parts of the genome sequence between the pangolin virus and the human virus.
To date, a comparison of the entire genome found the most 92<0x25> genetic material similarity between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the pangolin is an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately done through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CTs should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19."
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first circulated on January 17.
Testing using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on breathing or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, these tests are performed on nasopharyngeal usability, but throat usability can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to be widely approved.
In the US, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of radiographic imaging and computed tomography (CT) in symptomatic people include opacity of asymmetric peripheral glass ground and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Because it overlaps with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging without PCR confirmation has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining comprehensive personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and wearing wipes when coughing or sneezing and throwing them directly into the trash.
People who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical restrictions measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in various regions have restricted or appealed to stop all nonessential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community-scale spread in most areas of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some members of the public do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers who deal with people who may be infected are advised to perform standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The government’s use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has sparked privacy concerns, with statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the user's proximity to other phones.
Next, users will receive a message if they are close to someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Circumventing misunderstandings about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and rinsing with mouthwash is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after coming from the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; and after penetrating their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This encouragement is because, outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soaps that damage its protective layer.
The CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60<0x25> by volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO recommends that people do not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (within one minute of disinfectant exposure to stainless steel surfaces), including 62–71<0x25> ethanol, 50–100<0x25> isopropanol, 0.1<0x25> sodium hypochlorite, 0.5<0x25> hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5<0x25> povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in public facilities, such as offices or daycares, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sufferers, be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with bended elbows or use tissue when coughing or sneezing, then immediately remove the tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and mileage of expiratory droplets spread while talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on the time and manner of wearing masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch the face with insufficiently clean hands, which is a major source of transmission."
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people caring for COVID-19 sufferers, although the WHO also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun encouraging the use of masks to members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of cloth. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to healthy communities, especially when adjacent (1 meter (3 feet) or less) to others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or living in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from public places without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering the convenience store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all its citizens to wear face masks while in public.
Taiwan, which produces ten million masks a day since mid-March, has required commuters of trains and intercity buses to wear face masks as of April 1.
Panama requires the use of face masks whenever outside the home, as well as recommends the manufacture of homemade face masks for those who cannot afford face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restrictions (also called physical restrictions) are infection control measures intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social restriction methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply social restriction methods by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping physical distance from others.
Today, many governments are obliging or calling for social restrictions in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced, from 250 (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50, and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Elderly and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension, and impaired immune systems that have a higher risk of serious illness and complications recommended the CDC to as much as possible only at home in areas experiencing outbreaks at the public level. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to subscribe to the term “social"
The use of the term "social restrictions" gives the impression that people should isolate themselves completely socially and not encourage people to stay in touch with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic period.
These recommendations include the recommendation to have sex only with people who live with you and do not have any virus or viral symptoms.
Home self-isolation is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for correct self-isolation. Many governments require or recommend self-isolation for the entire population living in the affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instruction was issued to people belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19 sufferers and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with a wide spread of COVID-19 are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies in epidemic control are containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people as well as undertake other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease to the entire population.
When it is no longer possible to stem the spread of the disease, subsequent efforts move to the mitigation stage: these steps are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the health care system and the community.
A combination of containment and mitigation actions can be performed at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction rate to less than 1.Part of the management of infectious disease outbreaks is seeking to lower the epidemic peak, known as the epidemic curve.
This lowers the risk of being overwhelmed on health services and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Nonpharmaceutical interventions to deal with the outbreak include individual precautions, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; measures at the community level aimed at physical restrictions, such as closing schools and canceling mass meeting events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in these interventions; as well as measures at the environmental level, aimed at implementing drastic measures.
Other countries have also implemented various measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass censorship and local quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who self-quarantine and imposes large fines for people who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of face masks and punishes hoarders of medical supplies. Simulations for the UK and the United States show that mitigation (slowing, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and repression (reversing the growth of the epidemic) have great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce peak health care demand by up to 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Suppression can be chosen, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this is first achieved), because otherwise the transmission will surge back quickly as the measures of suppression are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have an impact on the social and economic.
No specific antiviral drugs have yet been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are being made, which include testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medications, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the patient's condition.
Some compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for use in treating COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients was a basic step in responding to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO’s regional European offices have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to divert resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible canceling elective procedures, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and improving intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A pneumonia cluster with an unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was handled by doctor Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who told CDC Jianghan
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital notified their colleagues of the "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for the warnings he issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission later issued a public announcement on December 31 and notified the WHO.
Quite a number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan which then triggered an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during the Lunar New Year and because Wuhan is a major transportation hub and transit point.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Further official data show that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms as of January 20, 2020.Per March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, over 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Region restricted free movement and made border controls.
The national response included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or region quarantines) and curfews. On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90<0x25> of the population, were in a kind of territory quarantine in the United States, more than 50 million people quarantined territory in the Philippines, about 59 million people quarantined territory in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some kind of region quarantine condition, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later, which is about one-third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report showed the earliest case on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 26; this observation was notified of his hospital to the Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
The announcement to the public was released by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was notified on the same day.
When this notice was implemented, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by Chinese Communist Party secretary general <0x58>i Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been called the "largest quarantine in human history", the cordon sanitaire was announced on January 23 to stop travel in and out of Wuhan, and expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited within the city.
The Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was also built afterwards, Leishenshan Hospital, to deal with additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospital, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government drafted further measures to stem the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing a health declaration for tourists and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
All universities and schools in the country are also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions implemented several measures, particularly in terms of schools and universities.
Measures to work remotely are applied in some areas of China.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Control of public movements is applied in many cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) face some kind of restrictions outside the home. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent "importing" the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international tourists entering the city. On March 23, the only case of mainland China was transmitted domestically five days earlier, in this case through a tourist returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases had essentially been blocked and the outbreak had been controlled in China.
Travel restrictions on the same day were relaxed in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the region's quarantine was imposed. The Foreign Ministry of the People's Republic of China announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, without any specific details on the time this policy will end.
People wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
On 30 March, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and provide monetary stimulus packages for the company. The State Council announced a day of mourning by starting a three-minute national crescendo silence on 4 April at 10:00, in conjunction with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay respect online with regard to physical restrictions to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
On January 20, 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China.
On February 20, the state health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely caused by a meeting of a new religious movement in Daegu, known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji adherents visiting Daegu from Wuhan are thought to be the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, among 9,336 church followers, 1,261 or about 13<0x25> had reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after testing confirmed that three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
The flight schedule was also affected and changed. South Korea introduced a program considered to be the largest and best organized program in the world to screen viruses in the population, isolate any infected people, as well as track and quarantine the people who come in contact with them.
Filtering methods include the obligation to self-report symptoms by people who have recently arrived from abroad via a mobile app, testing of a flattened virus or drive-thru with results available the following day, and an increase in testing capabilities to over 20,000 people daily.
The South Korean program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantined the entire city. At first, South Korean society was divided on President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for impeachment of President Moon over their claim that the government made a mistake in dealing with the outbreak, or otherwise, praising the president's reaction.
On March 23, South Korea reportedly had the lowest total one-day cases in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April everyone who had just arrived from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Feb. 19 in Qom and, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
The initial steps announced by the government include the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and Friday prayers, as well as the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran allocates five trillion real to combat this virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there are no plans to quarantine the affected areas, only individuals will be quarantined.
Plans to limit intercity travel were announced in March, although heavy intercity traffic ahead of the Persian New Year continued.
Shiite places of worship in Qom remain open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020.After China, Iran became the center of the spread of the virus during February.
Amid claims that the outbreak rate in Iran is covert, more than ten countries traced their cases back to Iran on February 28, suggesting that the outbreak rate may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government on that date.
Iran's parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly testing positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release the human rights defenders detained for peaceful protest and, for a while, release all eligible prisoners.
It stated that there was a greater risk for spread in closed institutions such as detention centers, which also lacked adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, which is the highest number in the country since the start of the outbreak.
As of March 17, at least 12 politicians or officials of the previous Iranian government or who were in office died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran faces 50 new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there are likely to be five times more cases in Iran than reported.
It was also stated that US sanctions on Iran could affect the country's financial ability to respond to the virus outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for economic sanctions to be eased for countries affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China as well as declare a state of emergency.
Later, a cluster of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, beginning with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new law to stem the outbreak, which included a quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outbreak area, people are not allowed to go in.
Suspension of work activities and sporting events has been ordered in the area."On March 4, the Italian government ordered the total closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including a Series A football match, will be held in secret until April, but on March 9, all sports are suspended completely for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian High School of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation, and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols that might be used.
On March 19, Italy took over China's position as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths from the pandemic.
On 22 March, Russia reportedly sent nine military aircraft containing medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recovered cases in Italy, with most of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report said that what contributed to the high fatality rate was a combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test everyone infected with the virus.
Initially, the UK's response to the virus was one of the most sagging among affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the UK government has not imposed any social restrictions or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for being deemed less responsive and less intense in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement calling for a halt to all nonessential travel and social contacts and suggested that people work from home, if possible, as well as avoid places such as pubs, restaurants, and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational venues, such as pubs and fitness centers, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80<0x25> of workers' wages to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, namely banning meetings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activities only to activities deemed to be of utmost importance.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police through the granting of fines and dissolution of the group.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for businesses deemed "essential", which included supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. government's leading public health agency, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Nevertheless, the United States was slow in starting testing so as to obscure the actual outbreak rate at the time.
Testing was messy by a disability test tool produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal government approval for a nongovernmental test tool (by academics, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for testing until early March (a doctor's order is required thereafter).
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: "Many people who have symptoms and doctor orders wait for hours or days to be tested."After the first death in the United States was reported in Washington state on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, an action immediately followed by another state.

On March 25, the governor of New York said that social restrictions appeared to be successful as estimates of the addition of cases to double slowed from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City and 672 people died from this virus. On 26 March, the United States reportedly had more confirmed cases of coronavirus infection than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, there were 400,335 confirmed cases in the United States and 12,841 people dead.

Overall, approval of Trump’s crisis management is divided across the partisan ranks.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized U.S. dependence on imports of essential materials from China, which includes essential medical supplies.
Analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict deployment patterns and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on 2018 information from the International Air Transport Association, the people who travel from Wuhan are the most in Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Taipei.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne are also reported to be popular destinations for people traveling from Wuhan.
Bali is reportedly least able in terms of readiness among the 20 most popular destination cities, while Australian cities are considered the most capable. Australia released the Emergency Response Plan for the New Coronavirus (COVID-19) on February 7.
It said that there was still much that had not been discovered about COVID-19, and that Australia would stress border control and communication in response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, Australia declared a humanitarian emergency.

Medical screening was carried out prior to departure and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus were left behind to reduce the risk.
Only negatively tested South Africans were repatriated.
Based on the results of the tests, permits were issued to all South Africans, including flight crews, pilots, hotel staff, police, and soldiers involved in humanitarian missions; as a precaution, all remained supervised and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort.

In March, China, Cuba, and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with the coronavirus outbreak.
Entrepreneur Jack Ma sent 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective clothing to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for distribution by the African Union.
Later, he sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks, and 5 ventilators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern about the quality of Chinese-made masks and test kits.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 Chinese-made coronavirus test kits with an accuracy rate of only 30<0x25>; meanwhile, the Netherlands withdrew 600,000 defective Chinese-made face masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable masks, allegedly from China, but actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa, and on April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the Chinese government's efforts in managing and stemming the epidemic.
WHO noted the differences between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of cover-up thus hampering prevention and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "giving regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".
On 23 January, in reaction to the decision of the central government to implement the ban on transportation in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that while the move was “clearly not a WHO recommendation,” the move was also “a very important indication for the commitment to contain the epidemic in place of the outbreak is most concentrated” and he called it “unprecedented in the history of public health”.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared due to "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not yet have a qualified health system.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to impose measures that interfere with international travel and trade unnecessarily" as well as "WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement."
On February 5, WHO called on the global community to contribute <0x24>675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency to support countries that “do not have a system to detect people who are infected with the virus if outbreaks spread.”
Furthermore, Tedros made a statement that "the limits of our power are on the weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future."In a press conference on February 11, WHO designated COVID-19 as the disease name for this virus.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to give "a response in the form of the deployment of the whole force of the UN system".
Then, the UN activated the Crisis Management Team to enable coordination of the entire UN response, which the WHO said would allow them to "focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to bear the impact of the outbreak in a broader social, economic and developmental field."
On 14 February, a Joint Mission Team with China led by WHO should be activated; the team aims to provide international experts and WHO experts in China in order to assist domestic management as well as evaluate "the severity and spread of disease" by conducting workshops and meetings with relevant national-level agencies and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of countermeasures at the provincial and district levels, which include the urban and rural sectors."
In response to the growing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the assessment of the coronavirus threat at the global level will be raised from "high" to "very high", this is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergency program, warned that, "It's time every government on the planet faces a reality: Wake up.
The virus will probably come to your place and you should be ready," and urged that proper countermeasures can help the world avoid "the worst".
Furthermore, Ryan stated that the current data does not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, as well as saying that such a declaration means "basically we accept that every human on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
WHO Director-General said WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming rate of spread and severity, as well as the alarming degree of inaction." WHO received scathing criticism for being inadequate in handling the pandemic, which included delays in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
One of the harsh reactions included a petition signed by 733,000 people as of April 6, which addressed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to submit his resignation.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respecting the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group states that everyone is entitled to life-saving intervention and the government bears responsibility for this.
The group emphasizes that a lack of resources or health insurance should not be used as justification to discriminate against a particular group.
Experts underline that every individual has the right to health, including disabled people, minority groups, the elderly, internal refugees, homeless people, people living in very poor conditions, people in prison, refugees, and other groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are trying to deal with the social and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a program to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, along with point of view and advice.
From policies to strengthen the world’s health and economic systems to address the impact of regional quarantines and travel restrictions, digital centers include State Policy Trackers, and aim to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response in the face of coronavirus challenges.
The Chinese government has received criticism from the United States, United Kingdom Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, over the handling of the pandemic that began in Hubei province, China.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed relating to the handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, which is a sign of discontent with the political agency's response to the outbreak in the region.
Some commentators believe the move is intended to protect Chinese Communist Party secretary-general <0x58>i Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected earlier recognition of the coronavirus outbreak starting in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 coming from the US or Italy.
The US government of Donald Trump called the coronavirus "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "China's cover-up actions give strength to the virus that is now turning into a global pandemic." The word was eventually criticized by a number of critics as racism and "disturbed attention from its government's failure to deal with the coronavirus."
The Daily Beast got a U.S. government message outlining the communication strategy and clearly originated in the National Security Council, with the strategy quoted as "All about China.
We were told to try and deliver this message in any way possible, including press conferences and appearances on television."Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus were part of a propaganda push to influence the world.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there are "geo-political components, which include a battle to gain influence through the distortion of facts and 'political generosity'."
Borrell also said that, "China aggressively pushes the message that, unlike the U.S., they are a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called for the US to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, and reportedly send aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting aid aimed at other countries to their own countries.
There are also disputes over masks reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey picked up hundreds of ventilators aimed at Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with the coronavirus-affected Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China is responding bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a sign of good European solidarity."
On March 22, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin dispatched the Russian army to send military medical personnel, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm attacks.
Lombardy's president, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo planes containing medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to colleagues in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that if U.S. medical equipment and materials manufacturers get a chance, they will also be able to retaliate if necessary."
NATO's planned "Defender 2020" military exercises in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war drills since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign Kate Hudson criticized Defender 2020’s exercise: “In the current public health crisis, this exercise is not only endangering the lives of U.S. troops and many participating European countries, but also the residents of the countries in which they operate.”
On 14 March 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders for help and said that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions on Iran. This outbreak has prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public funding.
Political analysts suspect it could negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea are deteriorating due to this pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at a government-appointed location.
Initially, South Korean society was divided over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed the petition, either calling for Moon's impeachment, based on their claims about the government's mismanagement of the outbreak, or praising its response. The pandemic has allowed many countries to respond by issuing emergency laws.
Some commentators expressed concern that it could allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, as well as punish people deemed to be spreading false information about the virus and handling the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus outbreak is being blamed for the lack of supply cases, stemming from increased use of equipment globally to fight outbreaks, panic buying, and disruptions in factory operations and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Some areas also experience purchases due to panic resulting in a vacancy of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, which trigger a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and triggered a delay in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It also leads to a worldwide shortage of self-protective devices, and the WHO warns that this will harm health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in a shortage of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were spared food shortages.
China and Italy's measures in countering the hoarding and illegal trade of essential products were successful so that the anticipated acute food shortages would occur in Europe and North America could be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not experienced a significant decline, but prices can increase according to industry representatives.
The empty food shelf was only temporarily found, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials removed pork reserves to ensure the people's nutritional adequacy.
Similar laws also exist in Italy, which require food producers to reserve reserves for emergencies such as these.
The global economic downturn has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 as a result of measures taken by the government to contain the spread of the virus, and retail sales plunged by 20.5<0x25>.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, viral outbreaks are thought to be causing a major threat of destabilization to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimates that the market will remain volatile until there is a clearer picture of the potential outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of the economic fallout from the epidemic on global growth could surpass the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate from experts at Washington University in St. Louis said the outbreak impacted more than <0x24>300 billion in world supply chains, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to be “distraught” after petroleum prices fell sharply due to reduced demand from China.
On February 24, the global stock market crashed due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to rising concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, which include the NASDAQ-100, the S<0x26>P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded the sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
The three stock indices closed the week with a drop of more than 10<0x25>.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the Chinese government's credit rating, but retained Negative Outlook.
Stocks plummeted again due to fears of coronavirus, the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many people think an economic recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the central bank's and state's timely emergency measures.
The central banks reacted faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closures of public places including tourist attractions, and government actions that restrict travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the shipping lane industry is at a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Lunar New Year holiday.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by the central and local governments, including the annual Chinese New Year festival, and private companies also independently closed stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Chinese New Year events and tourist attractions are closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibits.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and territories, authorities extended the New Year holiday to February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions make up 80<0x25> of the country's GDP and 90<0x25> of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease countermeasures to the highest levels and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March, and cancelled New Year celebrations. The retail sector is affected globally due to reduced working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40<0x25>.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers experienced a 50–60<0x25> decline.
This also resulted in a 33-43<0x25> decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Worldwide shopping mall operators impose additional measures, such as improved sanitation, the installation of thermal scanners to check buyer temperatures, and the cancellation of events. According to estimates of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to increase between 14 and 22 million people compared to the pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of China's 300 million rural migrant workers are displaced at home in the inland province or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates, the coronavirus outbreak can lead to the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32<0x25>. Quarantine areas in India cause tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. A survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44<0x25> of households in Canada experienced some sort of job loss in March 2020. Almost 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since its enactment.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany submitted a government-subsidized short-term work scheme for its employees, called Kurzarbeit.
Germany's short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and the United Kingdom.
Worldwide, the performing arts and cultural heritage sector has been impacted greatly by the pandemic, affecting the operation of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and self-employed.
Art and culture sector organizations seek to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, safeguard the safety of employees and the community, and support artists where possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at varying levels, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with its exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were put into providing alternative services through digital platforms. Other adverse impacts of the disease that are recent and very rapidly developing are the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, as well as fashion shows.
The film industry has also been disrupted. The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which falls in the last week of the Christian penance season, was cancelled.
Many dioceses encourage Christian elders to stay home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services via radio, online live broadcasts or television, while others offer drive-in or lantatur worship.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese as well as the emptying of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and restricted public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
Iran's health ministry announced Friday's cancellation of prayers in the affected areas and places of worship were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as their residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the worldwide sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics plans, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but will be no more than summer 2021." Worldwide, casinos and other gaming venues were closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to switch to online gambling, many online gambling sites reported a significant increase in new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delaying or canceling concert tours.
Many big theaters like Broadway also put off all shows.
Artists explore a variety of ways to continue producing and sharing works over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as online live concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their work.
Many coronavirus-themed Internet memes are spread online with many people turning to humor and distractions amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as against people from affected regions in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
The report from February (when the majority of cases were still limited in China) noted racist sentiment expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese people deserve the virus or accept what they claim is a worthy reward.
Several countries in Africa have also experienced an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination due to their local origin.
There is already support for the Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the development of the outbreak into new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to ban Chinese from entering their country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States report increasing rates of racist abuse and assault.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus", a term that critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which borders China, and studying in major Indian cities are reported to have been harassed in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
President of the Bharatiya Janata Party state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China has destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "wrong".In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents flared up due to the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers that use paid restrictions have removed them for part or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make outbreak-related scientific papers available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share the results quickly on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed with RT-PCR, which detected the RNA of the coronavirus.
This testing is specific and designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA alone.
This test is used to confirm a new or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for population diagnosis and surveillance.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have been infected, including people whose symptoms are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
Accurate disease mortality rates and group immunity levels in the population can be determined from the results of these tests.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has yet reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country has yet tested more than 3<0x25> of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests that countries have conducted.
This variability may also significantly affect reported case fatality rates, which are likely to count too high in some countries.
Using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on breathing samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
RT-PCR tests performed on throat swabs are only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for an infected person tested in the second week, the sample material can be taken from the deep airway by using a suction catheter or the material expelled through a cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed in Charit<0xC3><0xA9>, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) clinical detection device on January 28, 2020.
This device is looking for the "E" gene that all coronavirus betas have, and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Product Administration for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection tool. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Retrospectives (C) Retrospect
One in three genetic tests in the old version of the test gave an inconclusive result due to a reagent error, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was deemed unreliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only after that that that state laboratories and local laboratories were allowed to perform testing.
This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationwide on March 9, 2020.
There are no announced quantity limits; specimen collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that could be done within 3.5 hours at high volume so that one machine could perform about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an EUA from the FDA for testing that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology that is not PCR.
Since it does not require a series of cycles of temperature changes, this method can give positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates increasing production to 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the new coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) are being developed in Taiwan, in hopes of delivering results within 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid influenza test.
A review of the library published in March 2020 concluded that "the thoracic photos have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, while the findings of CT [computed tomography] may have been pre-existing before the onset of symptoms."
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetry, and posterior distribution.
Subpleura dominance, crazy paving, and consolidation are formed as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the point of origin of the current pandemic showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infections in individuals since about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to disease, and in population surveillance. An examination can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care (PoCT) testing.
An automated system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this examination, but its availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, it is commonly used one peripheral blood specimen, although a series of specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, it is commonly used one specimen of peripheral blood obtained through a skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction steps are not required before the examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide notifications to agencies as required and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA based on emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics got European approval for their test tool that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to viruses in blood samples.
Its testing capacity is up to several hundred samples in a few hours, so it is much faster than a conventional PCR examination of viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong devised a scheme for suspected patients to stay at home, "emergency department will give patients a specimen tube," they spat into it, sent it back, and got test results moments later. NHS England announced that the NHS was pioneering a scheme of suspected case testing at home thus eliminating the risk of patients infecting others if they came to the hospital or had to disinfect an ambulance.
The lantatur testing center has helped South Korea perform the fastest and widest testing of any country. On March 2, the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient order and 10,700 tests had been conducted in the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance if the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, lantature tests were offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown because only positive results are reported.
A first lab survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including weeks 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9<0x25>) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion Hospital and Rambam developed and tested methods to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only testing the samples further.
With its construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling showed that the case in Hubei could be 47<0x25> higher and the associated cost for quarantine handling could double if this testing capacity was not available.
Wuhan labs were soon followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, its total daily capacity of 50,000 tests per day. The open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. This balanced design can be run in small labs without the need for robotic fluid handlers.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents had become obstacles to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers are attempting to explore a sample setup protocol that involves warming the sample to 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March, the United Arab Emirates reportedly conducted more coronavirus testing per capita of the population than any other country, and was ready to scale up the testing to reach a majority of the population.
This was achieved through a combination of population-scale mass-result lab testing and purchase of population-scale mass-result labs from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of China.
Various testing recipes targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German prescription for the production of test kits sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control were not available until January 28 thus slowing the testing available in the U.S. At the beginning of the outbreak, China and the United States were troubled by the reliability of test equipment; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test tools to meet the demands and recommendations of testing health experts.
Instead, experts say that the extensive availability of testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built within a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the increase in the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus led to hundreds of thousands of tests awaiting work in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of usables and chemical reagents became precarious.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems on their test equipment.
In the United States, the test tools developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing by private. Spain purchased the test tools from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may result from failure to collect samples or using test tools correctly.
Spain’s ministry said it would withdraw equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80<0x25> of the test equipment the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China which turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that the test device be dumped into the Danube river. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said the test device Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and they did not "use it". Great Britain bought 3.5 million test devices from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that it could not be used.
Testing, which was followed by quarantine of tested positive people and tracking of people in contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive outcome.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases found were quarantined.
With restrictions on travel to these communities, new infections were eliminated altogether.
With aggressive contact tracking, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantines, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than other developed countries despite no extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened in time after the holiday on 23 March.
Some other countries also deal with the pandemic with aggressive contact tracking, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive quarantine areas, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had much lower case fatality rates, perhaps because these countries were better able to detect people who had mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 were in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "<0x25> Positive result of testing" is affected by the country's testing policy.
Countries that only test people who are hospitalized will have a higher percentage of positive outcomes than countries that test all their populations, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors in common.
Hand washing, also called hand washing, is the act of cleaning a person’s hands with the aim of removing dirt, oils, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands consistently with soap at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, that are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also contract respiratory diseases, such as influenza or colds, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., the mucous membranes).
The five critical moments throughout the day that are very important for washing hands with soap are: before and after defecating, after cleaning the child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not present, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child who has just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal feces.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the cause of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
It also reduces the mortality rate of babies at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that increased hand washing practices can slightly increase the high growth of toddlers.
In developing countries, the child’s mortality rate from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple act can reduce the mortality rate due to the disease by nearly 50<0x25>.
An intervention that encourages hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about one-third; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48<0x25> reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infection (ISPA), as subconscious behaviors are carried out in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the number one cause of infant deaths; it causes the deaths of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before meals and after using the toilet into an embedded habit could save more lives instead of vaccines or any medical measures, as well as reduce deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by up to a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary measures as part of a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is hand washing that is often done can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A study conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy and scaly skin conditions, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Hand washing too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of the disease, namely: before and after using the toilet (urination, defecating), after cleaning the child's buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Another important time to apply proper hand washing techniques to prevent transmission of the disease is before and after treating the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after touching the litter.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is still low.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7<0x25> of households habitually practice hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate with 23 percent. Now there are several behavioral change methodologies available to increase the adoption of hand washing behaviors with soap in a student at a critical time.
The Fundamental Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of appropriate scale measures to support the health and education of children.
The administration of worm medicine twice a year, coupled with daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluoride, is at the core of this national program.
The program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The cleaning of microorganisms from the skin is strengthened by the addition of soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier to solution and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic waste, are not easily soluble in water.
However, the cleansing of fats and proteins is helped by adequate water flow.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may be able to contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies examining the removal of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the removal was not possible because the bacteria were laminated with foam.
However, the CDC said that “liquid soaps that are out of the container without touching the hands are preferred.”
Antibacterial soaps are widely recommended to health-conscious communities.
To date, there has been no evidence that the recommended use of antiseptics or disinfectants is better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant organism strains.
So, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soaps, these soaps may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective substances, sophisticated formulations can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid as an active antimicrobial, and further skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon’s School of Public Health suggests that regular antibacterial soaps are equally effective.
Warm water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
Warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that resist dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to the beliefs of many people, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes at hand.
Hand sanitizers or hand antiseptics are hygiene agents that are not water-based.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents in the form of non-water based alcohol scrubbers (also called alcohol-based hand scrubbers, antiseptic hand scrubbers, or hand sanitation) became known.
Most of these hygienic agents are isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated along with thickening materials such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into a gel or together a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide increases further antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95<0x25> alcohol are efficient germ killers.
Rubbing alcohol cyanide kills bacteria, bacteria resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcoholic tangents containing 70<0x25> alcohol kill 99.97<0x25> (3.5 log reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99<0x25> to 99.999<0x25> (4 to 5) bacteria log reduction in the hands 1 minute after use. Hand tangentation is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk-type viruses), the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis. An adequate amount of hand antiseptic or alcohol scrubber should be used to wet or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and back of the two hands as well as on the sidelines and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be well washed by rubbing them on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand scrubbing, especially when the hands look dirty.
Increasing use of a sanitary agent due to ease of use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms; however, a sanitary agent should not be used in place of proper hand washing, unless soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can often cause dry skin, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused much lower skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps and detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive substances in alcohol hand rubers are rare.
A lower tendency causes disruptive contact dermatitis to become the attraction of this product compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-water agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, but only disinfect it.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogen is still on hand.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand-sanitizers is highly dependent on its ingredients and formulations, and historically, this product has performed significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol scrubs.
Recently, formulations that use benzalconium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy has been shown to decrease after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side-effect reactions.
Many people in low-income communities are unable to afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of the disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, if in contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Proper hand washing techniques based on the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for the prevention of disease transmission include the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because the silenced basin may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not appear to have any effect.
Brush your hands with plenty of soap, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly under running water.
Rinsing in a basin can get your hands contaminated again.
Dry it with a dry wipe or let it dry in the air.
Wet and moist hands are more easily re-contaminated. Areas that are often missed are the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can store microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep the hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, draining water from hanging jerrygen or bottled and hollowed and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations when water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-tap", as well as other low-cost options.
A tippy tap is a simple technology that uses a water bottle suspended with a rope, a foot-operated lever to pour a little water into the hand, and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
More and more research shows that paper wipes are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper lap industry European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of paper lap hygiene, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194<0x25> in the knuckles and 254<0x25> in the palms.
Drying with a jet air dryer led to an average 42<0x25> increase in the total number of bacteria in the knuckles and 15<0x25> in the palms.
After washing and drying the hands with paper wipes, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76<0x25> in the knuckles and 77<0x25> in the palms.Scientists also conducted tests to determine the potential for cross-contamination in other toilet users and the toilet environment due to each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which exhales air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to blow microorganisms out of the hands and units and potentially contaminate other toilet users and the restroom environment up to 2 meters.
The use of a warm air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper wipes did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
There are many manufacturing hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying by using paper wipes.
Hand washing using hand-sanitizing wipes is an alternative during travel if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60<0x25> alcohol.
Medical hand washing was required long after the Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of such devices.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water in large amounts or gels to wipe and rub each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed against each other with interlocking fingers.
If there is dirt under the nail, a feather brush can be used to remove it.
Because germs can survive in the water on the hands, the hands need to be rinsed thoroughly and dried with a clean wipe.
Once dry, a paper wipe is used to turn off the water faucet (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids the re-contamination of the hands from the surface.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care order is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing is still at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching patients thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that correct hand washing and other simple procedures can lower the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing standards of hand washing and hand rub in the health care sector.
The WHO hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be seen on its website for public comments.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstrations of regulatory compliance are required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Seconds" to wash hands:
after exposure to blood/liquid body
before the aseptic function, and
after the treatment of the patient. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (soap "drug" or "antimicrobial") serves to kill the handwashing material.
Such killing functions may be desired before performing surgery or in situations when antibiotic-resistant organisms are very prevalent. To 'rub' hands before surgical operations, it is necessary to turn on and off taps that can be turned on and off without touching, chlorhexidine or iodine washers, sterile wipes to dry hands after washing, and sterile brushes to rub down as well as other sterile instruments.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long brushing time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing, the water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
Upon completion of hand washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical robes are worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after handling the sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing came from the first 20<0x25> of washing, and that the additional benefit gained was very little when the frequency of hand washing was increased above 35<0x25>.
Washing with ordinary soap results in more than three times the transmission of infectious diseases to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparisons between rubbing hands with an alcohol-based solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each show that alcohol-based hand rubers reduce bacterial contamination 26<0x25> more than antibacterial soaps.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in the health care order can involve education for staff about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubers, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in various health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective fundamental way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap, or handwashing facilities in residents’ homes, schools, and workplaces makes the goal of achieving universal hand washing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand-washing taps near private toilets or public toilets are rare, although options are available to make hand-washing inexpensive.
However, low levels of hand washing can also occur because of embedded habits and not because of lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and encouragement of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and result in long-term changes in population behavior.
In order to run effectively, supervision and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in improving hand washing in LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of the promotion of hand washing in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one star to three stars.
Building a hand-washing facility can be part of a campaign aimed at reducing disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that tries to achieve its behavioral change goals. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encourages the use of hand washing emojis.
Several studies examined the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of disability-adjusted life year (DALY) or the size of the year lost due to illness.
One review showed that encouraging hand washing with soap was significantly more cost-effective instead of other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for vulnerable people, such as newborn mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" in England.
At the time, many people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-related infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more active in encouraging hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters of "correct hand washing techniques" are hung next to hand washing sinks in public toilets as well as in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands of" something means expressing a person's reluctance to take responsibility for something or get involved in something.
The phrase comes from the biblical chapter in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands over the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands continuously to clear the imaginary stain; an act that shows her guilt for the crime she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate hand washing equipment more.
Furthermore, people who were allowed to wash their hands after the meditation had a smaller likelihood of engaging in "cleansing" compensation measures, such as volunteering.
Religion commands hand washing for the purpose of cleanliness and symbolic. Symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a part of the ritual washing of hands in many religions, including Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> Faith, Hindus, tevilah and nethilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also commands hand washing after washing to cleanse
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims are required to wash their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazard management for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for hazard control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control of hazards in the workplace depends on the location of work and job duties, which are based on risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for each worker who may be susceptible to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have minimal job contact with the public and other co-workers; for this work, basic infection prevention measures, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, breathing ethics, and conducting routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Moderate exposure risk employment includes work that requires close or frequent contact with unknown or suspected persons suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to transmission in an ongoing community or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and high volume retail order.
Hazard control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective against sneezing, and providing personal protective equipment when encountering COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers health workers and morgues exposed to people known or suspected to suffer from COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or deal with specimens of, a known or suspected person suffering from COVID-19.
Appropriate hazard control for these workers includes engineering control, such as negatively pressurized ventilation chambers, and self-protective devices that fit the job duties.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact at work.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to take care of others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trading patterns may change, both in terms of the type of goods requested and how to obtain these goods (such as shopping outside rush hours, via shipping, or lantatur).
Finally, shipments of goods from highly affected geographic areas of COVID-19 can be disrupted. Preparedness and infection management plans can be used to guide protective measures.
Plans consider the level of risk associated with various workplaces and work tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community order, as well as risk factors for each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the controls necessary to address such risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and plans for treatment of infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goal of outbreak management includes reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the countermeasures taken.
The hierarchy of hazard control is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to group hazard control based on its effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and lastly a personal protective device.
Technical control involves isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in employment policies or procedures that require the actions of workers or employers.
Self-protective devices (APDs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent partial exposure.
All types of APD should be selected based on hazards to workers, properly installed as applicable (e.g., respirators), worn consistently and correctly, inspected, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and stored properly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have minimal job contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, respiratory ethics include covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissue and litter containers, preparing for work remotely or working shifts with a gradual arrival/return time, if necessary, informing workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and performing routine cleaning and rufesin work.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease should stay home until they are free of fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-lowering medications or other symptom-modifying medications, and that the sick leave policy is flexible so that it allows employees to stay home to care for sick family members, and so that employees know this policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure risk work includes work that requires close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with an unknown or suspected person suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around a business location, or because a new person travels internationally to a location with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
The staffing staff members include staffing staff who have contact with the general public such as at school, working environment with high population density, and retail order with high-volume staffing. The staffing staff members include staffing staff, staffing staff, staffing staff, and staffing staff, staffing staff, staffing staff, and staffing staff.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers includes separating the sick person from the other person by a distance of 6 feet, appointing a cabin crew to take care of the sick person, and offering a face mask for the sick person or having him cover his mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew must wear disposable medical gloves when caring for sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly other personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag of biological hazards, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial cruises, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard control includes delaying travel if sick, isolating oneself, and informing the medical center on board immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is carried out in an isolated person’s cabin. Regardless of the spread in the community, for schools and daycare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean up or disinfect if an infected person has ever been in a school building.
If there is transmission in the community at a minimal to moderate level, social restriction strategies can be applied, which include: canceling field visits, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, gradual arrival and return times, restricting nonessential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is high transmission in the local community, in addition to a social restriction strategy, extending school closures can be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily routine activities, immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must make contact with a confirmed or suspected person of COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect belts and duty equipment before re-use by using household cleaning sprays or wipes and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of used APD as well as to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers certain health workers and morgues to be in the category of high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk occupations include providing health care, support, laboratories, and medical transport personnel exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This work becomes very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, a patient known or suspected of COVID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some procedures and dental examinations, or the taking of invasive specimens.
morgue work at high risk of exposure includes workers involved in preparing the body of a known or suspected case of COVID-19 at the time of death; this work becomes very high risk of exposure if workers perform an autopsy. Additional engineering control for this risk group includes isolation space for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, covers when aerosol-producing procedures are performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
Specimens should be treated with Biological Safety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into different waiting rooms based on if they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet of known or suspected patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 face covering respirators or better should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes conformity tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and increase workers’ comfort. The WHO does not recommend fully covered or coverall clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at entry points.
For people taking breathing specimens, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures, the WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or face shields, robes, and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Given that the worldwide supply of APD is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for APD through remote medical services, physical barriers such as translucent windows, with only people involved in direct treatment may enter a room containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APD required for specific tasks, continuing to use the same respirator without removing it while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and administering APD chains.

We found ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is what makes clear the global human connection and the responsibility we have for each other.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the building of a global community, which is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and care we have witnessed among all our co-workers through email, calls, and chat is an incredible validation of the incredible human presence, which we are fortunate enough to have, to work with them.
I am so grateful and so proud to be able to call you a co-worker.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how important it is for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful it is for this important resource to remain available online for everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure the site stays up, helps pay our colleagues, or helps keep our community safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, especially today.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a meaningful impact for the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adjustment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we face and the best way to keep the organization going during this time.
We are eager to eliminate the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce the work schedule, that’s okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don’t set holidays, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission requires you.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you need to take care of a loved one, shop for basic necessities, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your work time.
If you are sick, do not work.
This should not have to be said, but we said it.
Sick leave or PTO is not required, just let your manager know and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to make sure key areas of work can be completed.
(If you are positively diagnosed with COVID-19, please let Bryan know in T<0x26>C Ops so that T<0x26>C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the right attention from management).
Partners whose wages are hourly based will be paid in full.
We have said it, and said it once again, in honor of our commitment to our fellow contractors and clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal working hours when things are normal.
This includes if you’re sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way of channeling stress into the world around us.
The work we do can be very rewarding, especially in times like these.
Again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There is some work to keep going.
SRE, HR Operations, Trust <0x26> Security, as well as the Funding team, among others, perform important work that may require additional support.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess our current goals and shift our focus to supporting the essentials for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus fully on the most essential projects.
Slowing down the present will be nothing for the future.
We do not plan to "overtime work catch up" after this pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet current unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that the situation is changing and will strive to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adjust to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to create a budget so that employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and the care of loved ones while accommodating those who need or want to work with fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
This timeline extension greatly reduces the current workload and planning pressures across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we get confirmed.
Thank you APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we hired an antivirus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antivirus fluids to disinfect any surface, lobby, and all elevators that access our floors.
The building implements its own safety assurance protocol by using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We are happy that the office will be ready for use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members based in DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to a full-range working order, in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues based in NYC know, we are also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still going on, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked remotely for the first time.
Our long-time colleagues who work remotely realize that it may need adjustment and they want to advise you:
Limit the duration of the meeting to a maximum of an hour or two.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into several days.
Define the meeting clearly, create an agenda, and send the reading material in advance.
Make video the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Appoint a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and record a list of speakers, and someone to help make a meeting note (or do collaborative note-making).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy small meals.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel at Slack to talk to colleagues about shared work
The HR Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to support the improvement of distributed work across the Foundation.
Last week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declared the pandemic to be over.
We inform them that we understand our requests for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete approved grant activities and that no one will be penalized for having to delay or modify such targets.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the sentiments of the entire global community seem to be a sadness as a result of this disruption, but at the same time a relief to the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for communities to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We will send you an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take the time to connect with each other.
We are both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep updating this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, major workflows, or difficulties regarding coverage, or anything else that may require assistance, feel free to inform and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and be the liaison as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive issues, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of Global Operations of HR International.
None of these changes are seen as a neglect of our jobs and obligations.
Rather, this change is an acknowledgment that, at present, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in a way we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movement needs, and provide the world with the services they rely on.
The work we have planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for important work to come in the next few weeks and maybe the next few months.
We need you all to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work at your best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzyme modifier angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has the opposite activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metaloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has the M2 domain of terminal peptidase-N and the renal amino acid transporter domain collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single type I pass membrane protein, with enzymatically active domains exposed to cell surfaces in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved proteins are released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes especially type II pulmonary alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
Expression of mRNA ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the amino acid phenylalanine terminal carboxyl from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane traffic of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as a major entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of protein S1 to spikes or bulges of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into endosomes located within the cell.
The process of entry of this virus also requires priming the S protein by the host protease serine TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact leads people to hypothesize that a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells may be able to help combat infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE and ARB inhibitor therapy.
A systematic review and metaanalysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34<0x25> decrease in pneumonia risk compared to control."
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients who have a higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with decreased pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to increase pulmonary hemodynamic and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipolysis.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute work start in addition to the 24-hour long effect (duration).
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation. Infusions of rhACE2 have been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory syndrome.
The COVID-19 app is a mobile software application designed to help contact tracking to cope with the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which have official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are questionable, especially with regard to systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of users of the application.
Alternatives that do not over-infiltrate privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to another phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has deployed an application that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 sufferers.
The app is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopCorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health care authorities.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application is in advanced development stages and will be available for deployment in a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether Singapore app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for COVID-19-diagnosed patients living in Moscow; these applications are designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur in application-based systems, which include false positives and a possible lack of effectiveness if the data the application retrieves is limited to a small percentage of the population alone.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, i.e. restricting only to "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates voiced their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, in particular on whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be halted once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
The organization stated eight requirements on government projects:
The surveillance must be "lawful, necessary, and proportionate";
expansion of monitoring and surveillance should have a sunset clause;
the use of data should be restricted for the purposes of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and proven to be evidence-based;
Digital surveillance should avoid the worsening of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in the law;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means all "relevant stakeholders" are required, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups. Germany's Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the problem of continuous surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from the device's operating system once it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, rather than apps, thus eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server need to access private location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use the central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources, includes mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government is also making the location information publicly available, which is allowed with widespread changes to information privacy laws following the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is publicly available through a number of applications and websites. Countries like Germany consider using both a centralized system and a system that protects privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not been released.
Contact tracking that protects privacy is an established concept, with a large amount of research literature starting from at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record users' proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Close Tracking That Protects Decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, formerly called Contact Event Number, CEN), Protocols and Mechanisms
In this protocol, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or flow-intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, the company that developed privacy technology and was originally also established at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and officers without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have essentially the same approach and are a much overlapping protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a major aspect of achieving broad acceptance.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government applications open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also published the specifications of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three stages:
The launch of a tool to allow the government to create an official coronavirus tracking app that protects privacy
The integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple plan to address the problem of data retrieval and continuous surveillance by initially distributing the system through an operating system update, then removing it in the same way after the threat has passed.
A drug reposition (also called a new purpose, new profile, or new task on a drug or transition therapy) is the use of a drug that has been approved for the purpose of a new treatment, i.e. for a disease or medical condition that is different from the original purpose of drug development.
It is a scientific research pathway currently under way to develop safe and effective treatment of COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be targeted for drugs, each protein having multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of such ligand binding sites could be the basis for an effective antiviral drug development project against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, S proteins, and ADP ribofosphatases.
Hussein A, et al examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed for their skeletal similarity to approved drugs and had the highest diminution to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potent drugs in their preclinical studies to be recommended in the design of clinical studies.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydrochloroquine were two of four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that trials of chloroquine and hydrochloroquine in New York would begin on March 24, and on March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphates based on the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC says that "the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been established.
Doctors said they used the drug when "there was no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are ongoing at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting safety trials and efficacy of the use of hydroxychloroquine preventatives.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminds the public that the evidence available to support the drug is not much and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for supplies and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in cases of severe illness with a virus that has been multiplication.
This medicine may not be safe if used by pregnant women or people trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), which is a combination of the lopinavir and ritonavir antivirus, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in the scientific community about directing resources to reposition drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the trial of international Solidarity.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against some filo-, pneumo-, paramikoso-, and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-test studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospital, one for people with moderate illness and one for people with severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19, namely two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The State of New York began trials for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhalated corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of patients with a new, presymptomatic coronavirus infection.
For a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, Phase II trials are underway with 200 patients to be recruited from severe cases treated in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently researching the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use effective contraceptive methods are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients thus prompting the Italian Drug Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study on 300 patients examining the use of sodium enochaparin on prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention is focused on giving new treatment goals to approved and developed antiviral drugs for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to Chinese guidelines 7th edition
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to Chinese guidelines 7th edition
Some antibiotics identified potentially as drugs that could be given a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by China.
In addition, trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
b'Vaccine COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there are many efforts being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the disease, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I security studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
Large outbreaks spread around the world in 2020, resulting in large investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that the things to look out for in developing vaccines are speed, production capacity, deployment at the required scale, as well as global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to make vaccines effective against COVID-19.
The main platform targets that advanced to Phase I security studies, include:
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (developers of Phase I and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (developer Phase I and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials conducted preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually performed randomly, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations, while determining a more precise effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involved more participants, including the control group, and tested the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates that are being actively developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of these are yet to be in human evaluation (still in "practical" research).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential of molecular clamping vaccines that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they are beginning to develop a vaccine, with a testing target in humans by 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they were starting to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is working with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on vaccine design with similar technology to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and would begin testing.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced they were starting a vaccine project to make the peptide vaccine Ii-Key against COVID-19.
They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested on humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Supply Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were working with Novavax Inc.
in the development and production of vaccines.
Furthermore, the partnership announced a preclinical testing plan and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced they were working on 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, the development of the vaccine took at least about one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is currently in laboratory research, with testing on humans planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that the US President, Donald Trump, had offered "a 'large amount of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, the mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they will get preclinical testing results in April 2020 and vaccine candidates who are in the final stages can start testing in humans in the fall.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced a US<0x24>4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wine, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with total CEPI investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine reaching US<0x24>29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates in animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine that could self-implement for COVID-19.
Vaccine candidates were developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C<0x24>275 million in funding for 96 medical countermeasures research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced a special C<0x24>192 million fund to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to set up a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurred.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing of PittCoVacc, a candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine, in mice; they stated that "The MNA that administered the S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine gave rise to a potential antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that began to be seen 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a heterologous effect, also called a nonspecific effect.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the diseases they prevent.
Further randomized trials in Australia attempted to include 4,170 health workers.
There is a possibility that the vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Preliminary research to assess the efficacy of the vaccine using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, shows the need for containment measures to reach 3 biological safety levels in handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there have been no protective drugs or vaccines for SARS that have been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In addition, proven vaccines for MERS do not yet exist.
As MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completes phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are virus-vectored vaccines, two adenovirus-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vector-MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts echo conspiracy theories claiming the virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccines have been available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell power, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is generally around five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases cause mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is primarily spread between humans when close contact occurs, often through small splashes or droplets produced through coughing, sneezing, or while speaking.
Although produced while exhaling, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious to long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can last up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and after the next stage of disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by reaction of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in nasopharyngeal disorders.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of contracting the virus and those who treat it.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend against the use of masks, some recommend their use, and others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be without symptoms or experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or tightness in the chest, confusion, difficulty getting up, and a bluish face or lips; medical stretching is immediately recommended if these symptoms appear.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, sneezing, or a sore throat can be found, but are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China were initially only with a clinical picture of chest tightness and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can develop into pneumonia, compound organ failure, and death.
This period is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5<0x25> of people with symptoms will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of these symptomless carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20<0x25> of all confirmed cases remain symptomless during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include cases without symptoms in its daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78<0x25>) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry viral loads on a large scale.
Talking loudly releases more sparks or droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs could cause droplets to be pushed up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
Although the virus is not usually transmitted by air, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air collectors placed in hallways outside people's rooms produce samples that are positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary cardiac resuscitation (RJP), can make respiratory secretions turn into aerosols and then spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that the virus can spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on cardboard, for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on 99<0x25> copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products break down the protective fat layer of the virus, deactivate the virus, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), were less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in the median two days after hospitalization began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All new features of SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the related coronavirus in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which damages its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-CoV.
The lung is the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cell via the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) modifying enzyme, which is most abundant in the lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike or bulge" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was found in 12<0x25> of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe illness.
Cardiovascular symptom levels are high due to systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in heart function.
The incidence of thrombosis (31<0x25>) and high venous thromboembolism (25<0x25>) were found in COVID-19 infection patients in the ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Autopsies in people who died from COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for airway epithelial cells expressing ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, T cells that secrete GM-CSF pathogenics were shown to correlate with the recruitment of monocytes that secrete IL-6 inflammatory and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrate has also been reported on autopsies.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This testing is usually done on breathing samples obtained through nasopharyngeal usability; however, nasal or sputum usability samples may also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but requires two blood samples taken over a distance of two weeks so the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing independently to detect infection by this virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected before) are under development, but have not been widely used.
China's experience with such testing shows its accuracy to be only 60 to 70<0x25>.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 for use by the end of that month. Diagnosis guidelines released by Wuhan University’s Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical picture and epidemiological risks.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution is widely encountered at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septum thickening with alveolar filling varies), and consolidation can appear as the disease progresses.
Little data is available about microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings on autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisi, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of many multi-core giant cells
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in the stage of healing: the arrangement of exudates in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: dissimilar intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings from fabrics in public places, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. Social restriction strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale gatherings in public places.
Restricted guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
As vaccines are anticipated to not exist until early 2021, the main part in dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after coming from the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating, as well as after penetrating their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Furthermore the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitation that contains at least 60<0x25> alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand sanitation is not available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are treated with support treatments, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends people who suspect they are carrying the virus to wear a simple face mask.
Oxygenation of the extracorporeum membrane (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being considered.
Self-hygienic and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to increase immunity.
Supportive care may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations to deal with hospitalized COVID-19 sufferers.
Intensive care experts and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first-line use.
Preventive measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health workers caring for COVID-19 sufferers, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Air-Test Infection Insulation Room (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and infectious-air precautions. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective devices (APDs) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment are: APD robes, respirators or face masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, a respirator (not a face mask) is better.
The N95 respirator is approved for industrial order, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
N95 respirators are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use not mentioned on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not too severe to the point of requiring mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are indeed severe.
This type of respiratory support for people experiencing COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized people, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-flow nasal cannula or bipositive airway pressure.
It is not yet known if either of these two methods produces the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to stick to invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannulas. Heavy cases are more common in the elderly (people over 60 years of age, and especially people over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the health system’s capacity to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases that is severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5<0x25> entered intensive care units, 2.3<0x25> needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4<0x25> died.
In China, about 30<0x25> of hospitalized COVID-19 sufferers end up in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators capable of high pressure and PEEP control modes are required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-related lung and pneumothorax injury.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, some of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended volunteers take part in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in case a person’s life is severely or immediately threatened.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove its safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so it can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health workers. Mahadata analytics on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people who come in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of contracting the coronavirus.
The move was taken to impose quarantine and protect people who may be in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told the mobile phone operator that "40<0x25> of citizens still continue to move around".
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People can experience stress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "The rising social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn are perfect storms that endanger people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can last mildly with little or no symptoms, which resemble other common upper respiratory diseases, such as colds.
Mild cases usually resolve within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may need three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infections based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs causing pneumonia.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can quickly develop into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, particularly increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6<0x25> of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while kidney function abnormalities were seen in 4<0x25> of this group.
About 20-30<0x25> of people with a picture of COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study examining early cases, the median time ranging from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), men had a 2.8<0x25> mortality rate, while women had a 1.7<0x25> mortality rate.
Histopathological examination of postmortem pulmonary samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromixoid exudates in both lungs.
Cytopathic changes of the virus are observed in pneumocytes.
The pulmonary image resembles acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8<0x25> of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage was observed, with increased levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89<0x25> of hospitalized people have congenital conditions. The availability of medical and socioeconomic resources of an area can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The lack of light case counts can cause the death toll to be calculated too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases that took place in the past can mean the current mortality rate is calculated too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to nonsmokers. There are concerns about the long-term sequela of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20<0x25> to 30<0x25> reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and a lung scan showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-treatment-intensive syndrome after healing.
Until March 2020, it was not known if the previous infection provided effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely to be acquired, if you look at the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there have been reported cases of COVID-19 recovery followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
The case is believed to be a deteriorating residual infection, and not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and comes from animals, through a spreading infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infection is almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, handling options, the time since the first outbreak, and the character of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO established ICD-10 emergency disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ratio of deaths to cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death toll ratio was 6.9<0x25> (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measurements include case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who died from a particular disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a particular disease.
These statistics are timeless and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not everyone who is infected makes antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7<0x25>) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through the Carnival festival, which spreads to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and likely not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3<0x25> of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0.004<0x25> of the population) were confiscated dying from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality was higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the difference in risk between men and women not appearing at 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for this difference based on gender is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reasons.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower smoking prevalence in women, and men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57<0x25> of infected people are men and 72<0x25> of people who die from COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of health workers who are female are higher, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographic locations (e.g. China), animal species, or a group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, these viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in accordance with 2015 guidelines that appealed not to use location names in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator components.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital desperately needed a ventilator valve, and suppliers could not deliver in the time scale required, a local company engineered it back-and-forth and printed the 100 valves required overnight.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine to treat this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to examine the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research into SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under study.
First, researchers aim to make the virus vaccine intact.
The use of the virus, either inactive or dead virus, aims to quickly trigger the human body's immune response to new COVID-19 infections.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits in the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on S-spike proteins that help viruses infiltrate ACE2 enzyme receptors.
A third strategy is a nucleic acid vaccine (a DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique for making vaccinations).
Experimental vaccines made with these strategies should be tested to determine their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic codes copied from viruses that cause disease. Antibody-dependent increases have been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials in progress as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
New purpose-built antiviral drugs make up most of China's research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in some countries with a reporting deadline at the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates already exists.Some existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which include remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with beta interferon.
In March 2020, there was provisional evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there is a call for peer review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, noted that double doses are extremely dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 sufferers.The 7th edition of China guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Early data suggests that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations.Research shows that early priming of bulge proteins by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of cytokine storms can occur in later-stage severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antisitokin properties. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
The drug is undergoing phase 2 non-random trials at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe illness.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to fight cytokine storms, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no randomized, controlled evidence to suggest that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and condensed antibodies produced by a system of people already cured of COVID-19 to people who need them is being studied as a nonvaccinated passive immunization method.
This strategy was tried for SARS with non-conclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a mechanism of action expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that depend on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced, are under development.
The production of convalescent serum, which is a fluid part of the patient's blood that has healed and contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
