Welsh AM fears 'look like muppets'
There is a growing fear among some AMs of the proposal to change their title and become MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was the result of a plan to change the name of the assembly and make it the Welsh Parliament.
People are afraid that a variety of colors can make a difference.
As an AM from Labour, their group is concerned that "it sounds like Twp and Pwp."
For readers not from Wales: In Welsh, pwp means stupid.
An AM from Plaid said the group was "not pleased" at all and had already proposed replacements.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" in changing the name, but he also said the MWP was not distant from the word Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w is identical in Welsh and the letter u in Yorkshire English.
According to the Assembly Commission, which is currently proposing legislation to change the name: "Any final decision on what shall be called by the Assembly Members shall be made to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals that had received broad support to call the assembly Welsh Parliament.
As for the AMs, the Commission favored the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support from public consultations.
AMs are likely to be exchanged, but it could hurt Presidential Officer Elin Jones' head to get everyone in line, who is expected to file a bill in a matter of weeks.
The child in the reforms will include other changes to the running of the assembly, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs are the last vote on what they should be called when they are already debating the law.
Macedonia votes in referendum to change the country's name
There will be a vote on whether to change the country's name and become the "Republic of North Macedonia."
This vote will take place in a bid to resolve the decades-long conflict in neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern counterpart means that it owns its territory and Athens has repeatedly opposed its request to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's president Gjorge Ivanov, who denounced the plebiscite for renaming, said he would not respect the vote.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have only changed their name to become part of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Vowels Silently as Churches Suffer in Harlem
"In the past, I used to say, there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's nothing."
The loss of the bars is understandable.
"People today are different," he said.
"It's no longer the fault of the town for the bars where people go all the time."
As for the churches, he feared that it would not be long before the rulers expected the money to come from the sale of property, "in time they will return to where they began."
He added that churches can be replaced with apartment buildings with condominiums filled with types of people who can't help the community's remaining sanctuaries.
"It's mostly white people who buy condominiums in these buildings," he said, "so it will only accelerate the day when these churches will close permanently because the people who will live in these churches will be far away."
White congregations built the same church before Harlem - Metropolitan Community - became a black metropolis in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
The black congregation worshiping near the building took its title.
The black congregation occupied St. Martin's under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, opposing the acceptance or promotion of blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's customers made plans, they put Carillon in commission.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to him at St. Martin's, called the carillon "the vapors of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A culturally rich" and "an irreplaceable and enjoyable instrument."
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, is the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon in Riverside Chruch 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
The event at St. Martin's in recent months is a complex story of architects and contractors, in which some were entered by non-ordered church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
In July the vestry - the ruler of the parish, made up of unordered chiefs - wrote to the diocese about the concern of "passing the expenses" of the vestry, although the vestry had nothing to do with the reception of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some customers complained of a lack of loyalty on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old shark dives for lobster in California
A shark attacked and hit a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived for the lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel on San Diego's KSWB-TV said he was diving for half an hour on Saturday morning with friends when he heard a boy begging for help and approached him with his group to pull him out of the water.
As Hammel said, he thought he was just eager to catch the lobster, but "I realized the boy was screaming, 'I'm bitten!
I've been stung!'
"It's been a long time coming," Hammel said as he approached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone who had fled the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was rushed to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego by airlift where he was listed as in critical condition.
It is unclear what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles at a media conference, spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago but it was not identified as a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim sustained severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and for safety.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams using beauty aisles in the style of department stores with specialist assistants.
As a key part of entering the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household apparel plummet, it will test out larger beauty aisles in 11 stores across the country, and will increase next year if it becomes successful.
Beauty investment is on the rise as supermarkets look for ways to fill the shelf spaces once used for TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
According to Sainsbury's, they will double the size of their beauty sales by as much as 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also receive additional branded space as seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket will also re-launch its boutique makeup products in favor of vegans for most of what it sells - something that more and more young consumers are asking for.
Additionally, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will try to sell in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the coming part of the year.
Shopping online and shopping for less food every day at local convenience stores has led supermarkets to work harder to encourage people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said department stores will look more like outlets as the supermarket chain fights off discounters such as Aldi and Lidl who have more non-food services and merchandise.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also entered several Habitats since they purchased the same chain two years ago, which they say has contributed to an increase in grocery sales and has led to a growth in the revenues of purchased companies.
The supermarket's last attempt to change their beauty and pharmacy department was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tried a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but it stalled after arguing over how to split revenue from its chemist's stores into supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its <0xC2><0xA3>125m pharmacy business with 281 stores in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding products of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
According to Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's: "We've changed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in colleagues with particular training and are willing to give advice.
The totality of our brands is designed to fill every need, and the attractive surroundings and convenient locations mean that we are the leading destination for beauty that challenges the old-fashioned way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'infuriated' after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is "angry" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal with her lifestyle business brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby had no time for Truly, their brand of home appliance and accessories.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning's 37-year-old actress announced her departure from the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby turned against Dragons Den star Peter Jones in a sudden retreat from their growing lifestyle brand business - to focus on his bumper contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was "angry" when the TV's golden girl admitted at an intensive meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of their giant business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she no longer had time for Truly, their home appliance brand and accessories, as a result of her new deals - reaching a value of <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The business has already been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is projected to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced his departure from Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to go to one of his boardinghouses.
According to a source: "Right now, Truly is Holly's top priority.
That would be his long-term future that would cross him in the next decades.
Everyone was very surprised by his passing.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, even if it was too close to the inauguration.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow HQ ready to be sold."
Experts believe the departure of the performer of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable personalities, will cost the company millions, with significant investments in products ranging from mattresses and candles to clothing and home furnishings, and with potential delays in its inauguration.
And it can serve as the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby began Truly with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become the brand ambassador of M<0x26>S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said "We will not comment on his business issues."
"We're friends and then we're friends"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for comments that could be "unpresidential" and for being very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump's voice echoed the "news anchor."
"I didn't give up anything."
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June which Trump hailed as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the denuclearization talks have been delayed.
Three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see "equal action" from the U.S. in its arms cuts.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to tighten its grip.
Trump had a more positive outlook on his speech at the rally.
"We are in a good position in North Korea," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now, we have a very good relationship."
He said his actions to improve relations with Kim - stopping rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and bringing the remains of American soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual way of telling stories about his relationship with Kim.
"It's always easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we have around 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the people directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia hit the island, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population is homeless, no national emergency has been declared, a precondition for inciting foreign aid.
"On many occasions, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for help abroad, so it's a bit difficult," he said.
Although Save the Children is developing a team to go to Palu, it is still uncertain if the foreign personnel will be able to work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster bureau, said Indonesian officials are still reviewing the situation in Palu to see if international bureaus will be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Despite the many earthquakes that Indonesia has experienced, they are still not ready for the harsh nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common in other coastal areas.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning already exists, is likely to be life-threatening as well.
In the best of times, travel between the islands of Indonesia is tempting.
Natural disasters have exacerbated the logistics.
An optional vessel stationed in Lombok to treat victims of the earthquake is currently en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia's deplorable infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign, and he has already invested a lot of money in roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration due to his upcoming re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing criticism from those who remain in sectarian strife in Indonesia, where most Muslims embrace a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands were left homeless as Christian and Muslim groups battled on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, and other ancient weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores to equalise against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea when he scored in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
<0x58>herdan Shaqiri punished Sturridge about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal as his team trailed 1-0.
He wanted to get the ball out of the way before he got to the far end of the goal.
The ball flew to the top of the box and landed in the top right corner of the net.
Eventually, the ball fell on the net behind the jumper Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"It was just in the right position, to get the ball and players like Shaq were always trying to play as forward as possible, so I just tried to take all the time I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I've seen Kante come forward so I've done it in a kick and I haven't been thinking much about it and I've just moved on."
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at halftime after scoring in the 25th minute from Belgian Eden Hazard.
In that game, the Blues striker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before he went into the midfield and passed on to Liverpool's side of the field.
Kovacic gave-and-go quickly in the midfield.
He settled for a foul through the ball, which brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard managed to take the defense and stayed with his left foot in the net of the far post just past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami reached 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster bureau on Sunday.
A 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday caused waves that reached 20 feet, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the bureau, said at a news conference.
The ruins of collapsed buildings in Palu City, with more than 380,000 people.
A 32-year-old man, who allegedly stabbed and killed a woman, was arrested by police
An investigation into the murder was opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found with stabs at 7:55am in Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged anyone in the area to come and see or hear anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has just begun but I call on anyone on John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard of any suspicious contact with us.
I also call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken any footage of the dashcam to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
A police spokesman from Birkenhead confirmed the woman was found and she was inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman came to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continued as police said they were informing the incident to the victim's close relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his flat but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was silent when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take several hours before they are allowed to re-enter.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
Over and over again, he said that it was "bad."
At 2pm two police vans were inside the cordon while another van was just outside.
There were several police officers standing inside the cordon and monitoring the block of flats.
Ask anyone with information to DM at <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and mention log 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament's latest monument targeted by the fight to 'change history'
Its removal was a landmark justice because of its Taliban-led destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artefacts carried out by its Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "planning to change history."
John Goldsmith, manager of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's image will be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the destruction of sacred images during the civil wars in England.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have sacrificed because of what his ancestor Thomas had done in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent creation of Cromwell's opinion in the 19th century and part of the study of the history of a man believed by many to still be worthy of celebration.
G Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: "Many regard Cromwell, perhaps more in the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external emphasis, in his case of course, the monarchy.
The debate over whether this is an accurate description is still going on.
It is only certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped our nation's subsequent formation, and Cromwell was a unique figure who represented an aspect of that divide.
It's also important to remember and celebrate your achievements as the Lord Protector."
A Chinese farmer's dream of killing a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, known only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead and with a severed artery, bleeding near a pig cage at a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig caretaker prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in <0x58>ining in Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he travelled with his cousin from the neighboring village of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and he discovered an open door in a nearby pig cage.
He said there was a large man with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the farmer was bitten by 550 pounds of pigs, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs are bloodthirsty and twisted," his cousin, known only by his nickname "Wu," told Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
Yuan and his cousin did not belong to the animal that killed the man.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent further attacks, while police were gathering evidence in the area.
Reportedly, there was negotiations between Yuan's family and market authorities for compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been cases previously recorded of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked the woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig stuck to a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife tried to scare the animal away.
After his pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but may serve as a "pull" on them.
"They're just playing games.
They love to bite, they're too revealing... they don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remaining strength will bring widespread and accelerating rainfall to the southwestern U.S.
As already reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it heads into the cooler waters off Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring flooding and rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa's sustained winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, hit at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and it was spotted 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a congealing trough over the Pacific Ocean and it moves eastward toward the West Coast of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward toward the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture will produce that will mix with the upcoming trough of extensive and heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, torrential debris, and landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall of about 2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
About 2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected in the Southwest, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions is possible due to the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It's not good to go out and walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain canyons can turn into torrents, and thunderstorms can bring local strong winds and dust blowing.
The approaching depression will bring local torrential rains to parts of Southern California's coast.
Rainfall can reach a total of more than half an inch, which can cause a slight flow of debris and slippery roads.
It will be the first rain in the region during its rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before the rains spread on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
Heavy rain fell in the Four Corners on Tuesday and lasted until Wednesday.
As the Arctic cools, October will see severe temperature fluctuations across the U.S., while the tropics will remain relatively warm.
In some cases, it causes extreme changes in temperature at close distances.
There is a good example of a sharp difference in temperatures across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is almost a 20-degree temperature difference between the cities of Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the rest of the summer heat will try to get stronger and expand again.
It is expected that a warm start in October with the vast 80s of the central and eastern U.S., from the Southern Plains to some parts of the North East.
New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be 10 degrees higher than usual.
Our long-term weather report says the high probability of higher than usual temperatures for the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the breathtaking testimony on Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political fight continued, with broadcasters delaying regular programming for Friday's final blow: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long investigation of the FBI's cases.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had drunk him and that he had tried to strip him at a high school party.
In a heated testimony, Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure that didn't happen.
It is likely that over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watched it.
The company counts the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers did not immediately become available for the other networks that aired them, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people watching the offices.
For clarity, this is equivalent to the number of spectators of a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel led the networks, where opinion hosts strongly support Kavanaugh's candidacy, with approximately 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
There are 1.3 million CBS, there are 2.94 million NBC, there are 2.89 million MSNBC, and there are 2.52 million CNN, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was voting in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS caught him on Friday morning screaming protesters as an elevator pulled up to a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood his eyes down as he insulted her for several minutes, and aired it live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you," one woman said.
"You think he's telling the truth?"
He said, "You have power, while many women have no power."
Before the elevator closed, Flake said his office issued a statement, saying that at the hearing of the committee he would say more.
All cable and broadcast networks have been live for hours, while the Judiciary Committee must vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate to vote.
But Flake says he will only do so because his understanding is that the FBI will investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which are already being pushed by minority Democrats.
Flake was somewhat convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and many other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision has power, as it is clear that the Republican votes won't reach approval of Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'politicizing' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politicizing" Britain's future and undermining the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside May's on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's alleged Chequers plan for Brexit, saying Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other "falsely."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police arrested the suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained in a second-degree murder case, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
Police obtained the mirror at the scene and said they had seen Simpson's DNA on it, reports WAFB, CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail is set at <0x24>350,000, reports The Advocate.
The Coroner's Office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, according to which, the cause of death was a head shot that pierced the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens for assisting with the investigation that prompted the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law students in the area for its "effort and search for justice".
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you're always worried about," Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano reached homes south of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and registered 183 emissions of air and ash within 24 hours.
The center monitors a lot of shock and vibration.
Images on social media show thin ash wrapping up car windshields in areas of Mexico city like <0x58>ochimilco.
Geophysicists noticed an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined the opposition movement to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's bitter vote in the crackdown.
The egg and powder paint of a group of masked pro-separatists pelted the riot police who stopped them, and it made black dust clouds on roads that were usually filled with tourists.
In the afternoon, the police also used firearms to control the fighting.
Pro-independence groups have called for "no forgetting, no forgiveness" in the face of unionists protesting, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, reports the local newspaper.
Tensions remain high in the region calling for independence after a one-year referendum on October 1 that was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters chose to self-promot themselves, though few voted because most of the anti-discrimination protesters boycotted the polls.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent police from voting in police stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to stop action supporting the national police.
The action continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer counting on the possibility of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year, we experienced one of our greatest moments.
I watched my parents cry because they voted but we're not moving forward," she said.
Despite a landslide victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan pro-independence parties have found it difficult to win this year's election because of their own exile or detention and many of their popular leaders are waiting for a hearing because of their role in organizing the referendum and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on her phone a protest supporting police, was fueled by politicians from both sides of the conflict.
"It's just getting worse," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced he would run in next year's European Parliament election.
"Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the withdrawal of democratic principles and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonerry: Three men arrested after being hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly beat a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
It may also be that at some point there is a crossbow left in the car.
Menga's Tiara, wins Livingston against Rangers, 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's victory
Livingston surprised Rangers to give Steven Gerrard his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's break was what was needed for Gary Holt's team to equalise with the Hiberian in the second.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and will face the Hearts leading scorers with eight points, next week.
Before that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, have extended their undefeated division play to six games, with head coach Holt having not lost since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost a chance against the brushed visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored, had it not been for their being directly causing trouble for Rangers.
Scott Robinson missed, but tried to score a goal, and Alan Lithgow's pass deflected away because he was met by Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts were content to play the Rangers in front of them, because they knew they would be able to torture the visitors at certain points.
This is how an important goal came to be.
The Rangers gave up a free-kick and Livingston got a chance, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson teaming up to support Menga, who got the ball and scored from the center of the box.
At that point, the Rangers had already got the ball but they had a hard time getting through the defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty,
This game continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had to force a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was intercepted at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow settled away from another set play by Livingston.
There continued to be transfers to Livingston's side and also continued to be pushed back, as two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were raised.
'Wonderful' from Livingston - review
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Wonderful game and results for Livingston.
With a person, they are good, constantly exceeding expectations for upward progress.
Their style of play and character hasn't changed much since they've been the best ever, but a big compliment should go to Holt for his motivation in the team since his arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett excelled, leading the organized defense, while Menga tortured Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the match.
The Rangers, however, were not impressed.
Whatever they came from under Gerrard, they did not meet those standards.
Their last ball failed - they only opened their side once - and it seemed like a call-up to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the ranks.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an reacts differently in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to fix relations between NATO allies.
They argued on issues of human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's ascension to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
In this city live the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police blamed security for blocking 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurdish - have also called for Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Two different protests mirrored divided visitors who were regarded as heroes by some Turkic Germans and criticized as dictators by others.
A car crash in Deptford Road: A cyclist has died in a car crash.
A cyclist has died after a car collided in London.
The collision occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, nearly a mile away in the collision on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were working to find out the man's identity and inform his relatives.
There have been road closures and various bus lanes and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison officials were injured in the riot at the men's high security detention center, the Prison Office said.
Riots began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are currently ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers were sent to deal with the riot, hooking up eight prisoners and keeping them on one wing.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Specially trained personnel have been dispatched to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not allow violence in our police stations, and we make it clear that those responsible will be taken to the police and could be detained for longer."
There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the station manager was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called to the jail to address a serious riot in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Sudden Flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Drought Areas Could Benefit)
Tropical depressions are rare for Arizona, but that could happen early next week due to the passage of remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa to the Desert Southwest, carrying the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has released flash flooding monitoring for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona through southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, along with the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Typhoon Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will approach Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix stated in a tweet that "just ten tropical storms have sustained a tropical storm or depression state 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest Hurricane Center models estimate 2 to 4 inches of rain, with a volume of up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest are likely to get 1 to 2 inches along with the central Rockies and the Great Basin, possibly with islands totaling up to 4 inches.
For those who are not at risk of flash flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is drought-stricken.
Although the flooding is serious concern, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second-highest category," weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa was the first to make landfall in Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Still with hurricane strength and maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, Typhoon Rosa was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, heading north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler waters in the Pacific and will therefore weaken.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm strength in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Rainfall can be severe in some parts of Mexico, carrying a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected in Baja California to northwestern Sonora, which is likely to reach 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Typhoon Rosa would then go on to Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which would then pass through Arizona as far south as Utah Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected in Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and torrential debris in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four, arrested in attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old with stabs was found in Somerset.
The teenage boy was seen wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area of Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials appealed to anyone with footage of what happened on the phone to show up.
Kavanaugh is 'tortured' by the tyranny, anger of the Democratic Party, says Trump
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to dispel the harsh and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "tortured" "by the brutality, by the anger" of the Democratic Party in the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified in Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying the allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that she raped her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to hearing about his accusation.
The President said on Saturday that the Americans "saw Kavanaugh's origin and quality and courage" on that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to confirm one of the most powerful brains in the law of our time, a jurist with a mechanized history of public service," he told a gathering of West Virginia supporters.
The President jokingly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the Republican vote count in the midterm elections.
"It's only five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not going to run, but I'm really going to run," he said.
"Everywhere I go, there are good candidates."
Trump says the Democrats' mission is "to fight and deter."
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, as, expected to rise
Approximately 384 people were killed, most washed away by giant waves on the beach, when an earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six metres (18 feet) hit the beach at dusk, as most of them died and destroyed everything they had gone through.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the threat of the tsunami rose yesterday, people were still conducting activities on the beach and did not leave immediately and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster prevention agency, BNPB, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"It didn't pass without the tsunami, it dragged cars, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami hit the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting shore.
Trees climbed others to escape the tsunami and survived," he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were displaced in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to rock the city on Saturday.
2.4 million people have experienced a series of earthquakes.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technologists (BPPT) said the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb held in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geography, positioned at the end of the long and narrow bay, may have boosted the strength of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, markets, and hotels had collapsed.
"The bodies of other victims were seen pinned down under collapsed buildings," he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher along the beach 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communication was "widely cut without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday as they did not warn of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man was shown on the upper floor of a building shouting warnings of an approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the beach, since buildings and cars.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut communications around Palu, and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun to send cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but food and other basic needs are still needed.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's too bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees remain in tarpaulin shelters built in the grounds of their fortress, they saw scenes of damage along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's so bad.
While aid groups have already begun the grim start of disaster relief efforts, some have complained that foreign aid workers with strong skills are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funding, equipment, and personnel from other countries can only start arriving if the disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This disaster is still at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'O.K., it's a national disaster,' we'll be open to foreign aid but there's no situation at the moment."
With the arrival of the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who lost loved ones continue to hope for the miracles that will fuel the devastating stories of national disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers removed a woman trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that finished earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an adult in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," she says.
Mr. Gendon recalled that, in the hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel's collapse spread to the paragliding community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to Palu players, who were participating in the beach celebration.
But his messages only resulted in a gray check mark, rather than a pair of blue checks.
"I think that's what it was, the messages weren't sent," he said.
Thieves, <0x24>26,750 drift while refilling ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves swept away <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's worker refilling the contents of an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle emptied an ATM into the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote on the release.
While he was busy, another man "runs from behind the Brink's staff" and steals a bag of money that must be delivered.
Many of the perpetrators were spotted by witnesses fleeing the area, according to the release, but police did not specify the number of perpetrators involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper will change his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
In an announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The once-recognised Kanye West."
West has long been nicknamed Ye, 41, and he used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande who canceled the show for "emotional reasons," said the show's creator.
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, 'you' means it," West said earlier this year in discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"Well, it's me, it's you, it's us.
From Kanye, which means the only one, to being Ye alone - being just a mirror of our goodness, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album better reflects who we are."
He was one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he announced a fondness for the names Love and Brother Love.
In the past, there have been a lot of people who have worked with JAY-Z West.
Mexico has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody anti-student uprising.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that "the military will never be used to control Mexican citizens."
Troops opened fire at a peaceful demonstration in the square on Oct. 2, 1968, during which as many as 300 people were killed during a time when leftist student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support Mexican children by providing monthly aid to students and opening more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of opportunities for education are dragging the youth into criminal groups.
U.S. should double funding to A.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in this field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments said after various parts of the U.S. government made advertisements about AI, even though the U.S. still lacked a formal AI strategy as a whole.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"The doubling of the AI research budget is a good start, as the U.S. has so far left all other countries behind, and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
Doubling funding will double the chances in the U.S. of making the next big AI success, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he was preoccupied with an AI system that defeated the best American player of Otherllo, after which, he became executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged past U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next contest would be held, to help identify future visionaries.
Often, researchers in the U.S. have to work hard to get help from the government, Lee said.
"China doesn't take the top academics; it's the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have taken luminaries from universities to work with AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy would help the U.S. strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to those with a PhD in AI," he said.
The State Council of China published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people and academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations provide funding to researchers from the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
In the first part of this year, the U.S. Defense Department established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to include peers from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to NSF, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has yet been seen by U.S. law seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for several months.
Macedonia votes to change the country's name in a referendum
The people of Macedonia voted to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" in a referendum on Sunday, a move that could resolve decades of conflict between them and Greece that blocks its desire to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, insists on its territorial claim to the name of its northern neighbor and rejects Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on a proposed new name in June, but nationalists argued that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the turnout would reach the 50 percent minimum required for the referendum to take effect.
This is the question on the ballot in the referendum: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership along with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the renaming, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth seeking access to groups like the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I go today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, for them to live freely under the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not covered by law, enough members of parliament said they would follow the result of the vote to ratify it.
The name change required a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous 2016 parliamentary elections in which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted because of my children, we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko vote for a referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country that could pave the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and suspects seats in front of tents arranged by mobo-boycotts in the referendum.
"We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the high-profile and not go through the gate of the servants" Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe a large majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said that the "yes" result would be a "proof of our future."
A poll published on Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they voted yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent and then one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the Western government's policy since it took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero takes full advantage of Brighton's defence for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling secured Brighton's defence in Saturday's 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero looked to ease the game with his points in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the series.
He appeared between three of Brighton's defenders, before hitting the open field.
Then, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green clothes.
He forced a defender before a few more runs ahead of Brighton's box end.
Then, he pushed to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a left over on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is having some trouble with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to get a goal at the time."
But Sterling gave the Sky Blues the opening advantage in the Premier League clash.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball while deep into Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a good pass through the ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before bringing Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward tapped the ball into the net before sliding out of the border.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play as a spoiler vs. Rockies
When the Nationals were knocked out of the playoffs, there was no reason to insist on another start.
But always-on defenseman Scherzer hopes to win Sunday's mound position in the game against the Colorado Rockies, but that's if the Rockies still have playoff implications with a playoff game advantage against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
At any rate, the Rockies secured a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hope to secure their first division title.
"Even if we play for nothing, we can step on the mound, at least, knowing that feeling here in Denver, with the people and the rest of the team, is probably the highest level of any point I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight there?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the starter for Sunday, but they are leaning towards allowing Scherzer to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer held a bullpen session on Thursday that would make his 34th start, and would pitch on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's visit to West Virginia
The President did not explicitly address the situation surrounding his choice for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of the outcome of the Republicans in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done in November is in full swing.
It's only five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of those big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running so I'm afraid to fight for the good candidates," he said.
Trump said, "You see this horrible radical group of Democrats, you see this happening today.
And they are determined to withdraw power by whatever means necessary, you see the depravity, the wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to tap to gain power and control, power and control over what they want, and we don't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, had a mission to "oppose and deter."
"And you see that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angerous and vile and obscene and lying."
He mentioned the name of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who received strong public acclaim.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you release the document?
Ah, ah, what.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm waiting for one - that's the most ugly body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
It's not a big church anymore.
It is no longer acceptable to those who express their thoughts.
When Momentum activists voted in my local party to denounce me, it was no longer a surprise.
After all, I was the last in the line of Labour MPs to be told we weren't welcome - all because of expressing our thoughts.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship petition criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, which is ironically similar issues to which Jeremy disagreed with past leaders.
The reminder for the Nottingham East Labor meeting on Friday announced that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, that's how GC meetings were every Friday night.
Unfortunately today, this is not the tone of many meetings and has long forgotten the promise of "more understanding, more gentle" politics, if it has ever really started.
It has become even more remarkable that opposing views on the Labour party are not tolerated and judging each opinion on whether it is acceptable to those who are superior to the party.
It started as soon as Jeremy became chief, as colleagues began to expect the same political view from me that I had turned my back on and taken positions that I would never agree on - whether in national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's the next wave of social media abuse that calls for deselection, criticizes middle-class politics, and says I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that's not the only experience I've had.
Indeed, I know that I am far luckier than some of my peers because the comments directed at me tend to be political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of the partners who face the overwhelming amount of sexist or racist abuse every day but never backs down.
One of the most frustrating aspects of this era's politics is how the levels of abuse have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour party should cultivate a culture of acceptance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every petition of "no confidence" or change of selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I've received a lot of advice over the past couple of years that I'm encouraged to just bend over, stop talking too much, and then, "I'll be fine."
But that's not what I wanted to do when I got into politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, aroused by Thatcher's government's neglect of leaving my comprehensive school classroom literally crumbling, I have sought to promote better public services for those in greater need - whether as local councillors or government ministers.
I have never been involved in politics, including politics.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
"To those who pushed forward Friday's petition, all I want to say is, when the country is plunged into a Brexit that will harm our homes, livelihoods, and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But, frankly, the one message I have is not in Nottingham Momentum, if not in my representatives, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threat of deselection or political expediency will stop me from acting in whatever I think is best in the interests of all of you.
MP for Nottingham East Chris Leslie
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr climbs to the top
Even the last two tests sidelined the final result, but Ayr undoubtedly deserved to win the amazing and entertaining match of Tennent Premiership day.
They are now at the top of the table, the uniquely unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their unique defense, as they had better chances, that brought home side and coach Peter Murchie every right to be happy.
"We've tested our games so far, and we're still not losing, so be happy I should be," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Beautiful in Ayr, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, which Frazier Climo converted, put Ayr in front, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors' game, allowed Melrose to score and Jason Baggot to score an unconverted try.
Climo broke Ayr's lead on a penalty, before, exactly at half-time, he scored and converted a solo try to make it 17-5 to Ayr on the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's try was cut short, with Baggot converting just five points.
Then, there was a long delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, released by the stretcherer, and from the restart, Ayr attacked forward through Stafford McDowall's try that Climo converted.
A yellow card was given to Ayr's standing captain Blair Macpherson, and again, Melrose allowed the extra man to pay off using an unconverted try by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a fierce force attack.
However, the home side recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, and from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down behind the advancing Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregory Henry away for the home side's fifth try.
Still Game star, looks ready for a new career in the food industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems ready to move into the hospitality industry, after discovering he was named director of a licensed eateries company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars alongside his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last to run the show, and it looks like Kiernan is planning for life after Craiglang.
According to the official list, he was a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun reporter hinted that Kiernan appeared to want to be part of Glasgow's "growing restaurant trade."
'To us the sea': landlocked Bolivia, hoping to reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling a naval outpost wrapped in rigging at La Paz.
Public buildings are waving a flag as blue as the sea.
Wet seas extend from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon with the saying: "The sea is ours according to the law.
It is a duty to recover it."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a beach lost to Chile's defeat in a bloody 19th-century battle with natural resources - such as the quest to sail the Pacific Ocean again - is still vivid.
Those desires have been at their highest level for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has a motto, a sense of unity, and security, and it hopes, of course, with a positive outlook on the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on big screens across the country, full of hope that the tribunal in The Hague will grant Bolivia's request that - after decades of occasional talks - Chile be obliged to agree to give Bolivia free passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year - also has a lot to do with Monday's decision.
"We will soon be back in the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia - and that there will be little change if that happens.
The UN body based in the Netherlands did not have the power to grant Chilean territory, and it agreed that it would not decide the outcome of possible talks.
That means the case is "uncomplicated" based on the arrival of the ICJ's decision just six months after hearing the final arguments, said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from the progress of Bolivia's struggle, it may have been hampered by the past four years.
"The current administration of Bolivia has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric undermined any remaining good will of the Chileans, he suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia's representative to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusual.
On Monday Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance to "end 139 years of misunderstanding when benefiting both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to get past the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen unless it can trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to continue the commitments made during a summit in Singapore between leaders of rival countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy after a summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un more than three months ago.
Ri said it was "a strong dream" to bring North Korea to its knees by continually imposing U.S. sanctions and opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration that Pyongyang has not yet taken important steps to reduce its weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are both looking forward to a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the weapons embezzlement that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of big headwear that will soon be unveiled on a High Street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely cover the sun, don't look for others.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a set of uniquely sized headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway making the style set spectacular at Paris Fashion Week.
This year's event is being held in a very special way, and the designers are bringing their amazing products to the market.
Valentino’s unique piece is a unique beige-colored hat decorated with a wide brim of bird flaps that surrounds the heads of models.
Other large decorations include bright watermelons, a wizard's hat and also a pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head cool.
Thom Browne also showed up with a selection of bizarre masks that were perfect for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have remnants and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
There is one creature that resembles a scuba diving gear that includes snorkels and goggles, while there is another that looks like a cone of melted ice cream.
And if you continue with this great fashion statement - you're in luck.
With the advent of fashion watchers, big bonnets are about to be released on high streets near you.
The big hat came in time after the 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a brim of two feet and was seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the ultra-practical hat spread on social media sent yet again another huge creation on the catwalk - a beach bag made of straw that's about the size of a model-sized swimsuit that holds it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringing and accompanied by a white leather handle, is the unique piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I expect to see the arrival of big hats and beach bags on the high street next summer - because of the size of the impression the designer has made, it’s hard to ignore the demand for big accessories.’
John Edward: Language skills that are important for the world's citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued into 2018 with the help of another body of excellent exam results, which were only strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to its students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, in their chosen career and place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that designs and implements the appropriate school curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be a popular and preferred topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it's going to get into his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will go into his heart."
It's a strong reminder that we shouldn't just rely on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exam, we can see that language is at the top of the league tables with the highest passing rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have earned a Higher A grade.
The data, collected from 74 member schools of SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students scored an A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also scored an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland have adopted foreign languages as essential skills that young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today, as the subject of choice, are considered to be equivalent STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, it was found that for reasons given by employers for the difficulty of filling vacant positions, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are especially needed for young people to be prepared for their future career.
Along with the increase in job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of a person's chosen career, if he learns a second language, he will have the advantage in the future due to having a lifelong ability like this.
People who speak multiple languages will automatically gain an advantage because of its ability to communicate directly with people from other countries.
In 2013, according to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were insufficiently able to speak a foreign language and only French was spoken in a two-digit percentage, which is 15 percent.
This is why it is important for today's youth to invest in language teaching.
Being able to speak many languages, especially in developing economies, will give the youth a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, schools vary greatly when it comes to the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for the UK when the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there is always a language option in independent schools, with specialist teachers in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing an environment suitable for teaching that will prepare young people and give them the skills needed to be successful, regardless of their future.
It is undeniable at this time, in the area of global business, that knowledge of the language remains important for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Without a doubt, modern languages should be considered as "powers of global interaction."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence for Scotland's youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans are waiting to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced James would play in the preseason opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"More than a minute but less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely be limited to minutes.
Following rehearsals early in the week, James was asked about his plans for six games in the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump will start a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, including visits to allied areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote is pending for his choice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump intends to come up with support for the upcoming mid-term elections because Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below through the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been tense over allegations of rape while holding the Senate's expected confirmation vote for up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the rally is to help the Republicans who will face tough elections in November.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said these five rallies next week focused on "mobilizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their holdings of a majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress's control over Congress is very important for its agenda of the president going as many states as possible as we're heading into a busy campaign period," a Trump campaign spokesman said in a statement.
The rally is scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight and it could transport supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and get reporting from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday it will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging on the ballot.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey to have to go to the president to try to strengthen him on the ballot," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed courage to keep hopes up for Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may have needed this Ryder Cup.
"Swinging pendulum of momentum" is a completely invented concept in the field of sports, but it is believed by athletes, especially in competitions such as this.
So, according to them, where is the momentum now?
"They only had six points, and now it's only four, so we've probably got a little bit of momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he left.
In Europe the advantage is, of course, only four points and twelve more remain.
The Americans, Speith said, thought they had a bit of a fuss and they were strong-willed, when it was because Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day and there were about three points out of four.
Spieth leads his side and aims at him from tee to green.
The celebration's cries grew louder as his round lasted, he was able to put in an important putt to make the match four boards after being two down after two with Thomas.
At the same time his putt shouted the same thing that won them the match at 15, the type of scream that said the fight wasn't over for the American side.
"You just have to be patient and think about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all there is to every player.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with higher points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable Ryder Cup story.
Four out of four can't do anything wrong with a strange but wonderful pair from Europe.
The "Molliwood" were the only pair who did not live with the bogey on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and back nines on Friday mornings.
That surge, and how their energy seems to flow from and into the noisy audience is proof that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no more famous player who can guarantee a win for the Europeans at Le Golf National if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
If possible, it would be in a different box.
However, it seems that the issue of the Europeans winning is premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when Alex Noren made them pairs.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede, and they were unable to get up again.
But on Sunday, there's nothing to help you get out of your hole.
It's comforting to watch the fourballs and foursomes closely because of the interactions between the pair, the advice they give and don't give, and the possible sudden change of strategy.
Europe played better as a group today and thought they were heading into the final day but this foursome session showed the strength and strength of Team USA that some, especially Stateside, had doubts about.
Europe are set to go 10-6 in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will only enter the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out on Saturday from four-ball and four-some matches with just 10-6 against the United States.
The strong pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molini led with two wins against struggling Tiger Woods to take their tally to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side that included Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to win back the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated against the American side that clinched the morning fourballs, and won the series 3-1.
The United States went on to fight foursomes more, and won two matches but they couldn't lower the advantage.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points as he and Molinari, named "Molliwood" after a superb weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they combined impressively to defeat the disillusioned Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who dragged himself into two matches on Saturday, showed short bursts of well-being but has already received 19 defeats in his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested for the morning fourballs, and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who were ranked first and third in the world.
The weather in the south-west of Paris has not been good for Europe.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans after scoring two points on Saturday.
They got a passionate 2<0x26>1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and came back to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4<0x26>3 in the foursomes after losing in the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team returned from a four-point deficit in singles, but as holders Furyk's side needed only a draw to retain the trophy.
After two days of being second in position, they seemed unable to cope with a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says 'unique' unilateral disarmament
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that its suspicions about the United States are growing because of continued sanctions and that the country will never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of representatives around the world that North Korea has taken "important measures with good intent" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying nuclear test sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we did not see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"While there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under this situation we will not really unilaterally disarm."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's rejection of a "silent" approach to denuclearization that honors North Korea as it takes small steps, his statement appeared important because it did not immediately reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang did then.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current President of the United States and head of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's safety.
North Korea has long been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected demands to reduce stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States is pressing for denuclearization" and lifting the burden of sanctions to achieve their goals in a violent manner, and they are also protesting against "declaring the end of the war," Ri said.
"The view that sanctions will honour us is a deep dream of people who don't know anything about us.
However, the fact that we're in the middle of a crisis deepens our understanding of the situation."
Ri had no plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which was announced by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister announced three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea and the United States are not the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not lead to a deadlock."
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed greatly from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. territory with North Korean rockets after "Mr. Evil" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year that he would "really crush" North Korea, hailed Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no set time for it, and also said, "If it's going to last two years, three years or five months - there's no case."
China and Russia have argued that the U.N. Security Council should honor Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Security Council sanctions should continue to be enforced strictly and without a minute until we are fully informed of the full, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has jointly tightened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said after he visited Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying there had been progress, only for North Korea to condemn him for making "gangster demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to demolish a missle site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "equal measures."
He said Kim had mentioned to him the "equal measures" he was looking for were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and a path to the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students, take a course on having enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University is helping its undergraduates get a good night's sleep in an attempt to combat the macho culture of studying overnight while powered by caffeine.
One academic found that students at the world's number one university often don't know about the most basic ways to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, sleep medicine teacher at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed to be the earliest of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving an issue about the impact of sleep deprivation on the study.
“After that, a woman came up to me and said: ‘Why haven’t I been told this before, in my senior year?’
According to him, no one told him about the value of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course explains to students the importance of having good sleep habits and how they contribute to academic and athletic activities, as well as overall health.
Paul Barreira, psychiatry teacher at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to enter the course after learning that students were completely sleep deprived for a week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is a picture of the dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athleticity, and the importance of a routine for sleep.
In another section, participants were told how sleeplessness increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
There is a campus map, with interactive icons, that encourages participants to reflect on their daily activities.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have a right to know - as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of having an ‘all-nighter' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students is raising the problem of sleep deprivation.
Making sure you have enough sleep, with good quality, should serve as the students' ‘secret weapon' to fight stress, extreme fatigue and anxiety, he says - also to prevent weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger, so they become constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking a class during his first year at Harvard.
He said his eyes were open and he had the inspiration to pursue a school course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask students to complete a study program like this one before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm when to go to sleep and wake up, and be aware of the adverse effects of ‘blue light' emited by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt circadian rhythms, and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocked down Gerrard's team
The Rangers were once again disappointed after Dolly Menga's goal gave Steven Gerrard's side a 1-0 defeat to Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to record their first win at the opponent's stadium since their 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, to hang on for eight points against Hearts leading the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and didn't look to tie the Rangers' line-up with less inspiration.
While the Rangers dropped to sixth place, Livingston came in third and just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be even more problems waiting for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be given a head injury remedy after apparently throwing something from the opponent's side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side to overtake Ayr into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi 11 that scored against Hearts last week and would have been pleased with how his great team managed to keep their opponents from every turn.
The Rangers were on top of the ball, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should have scored after two minutes when Menga's pass to Scott Pittman came close to the goal, but the midfielder turned away.
A deep free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Craig Halkett but defender Alan Lithgow could do nothing but force the ball to the back post.
The Rangers, on the other hand, gained control but seemed more confident than confident that their plan would be accomplished in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a penalty kick by a quarter of the game when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson sidelined the Colombian player's appeal.
The Rangers made two goaltenders in the first half of the game but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly failed to beat Lassana Coulibaly's header and light striker Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi scored in the 34th minute of its opening even though the opponent looked even better, they could not be denied due to their only graft.
The Rangers failed to act again against the deep set-piece of the deep Jacobs.
Scott Arfield made no move when Declan Gallagher slipped the ball into the slot to Scott Robinson, who calmly passed Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard reacted to the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the changeover almost had a quick effect when the winger slotted Morelos, but the impressive Kelly quickly ran from his line to intercept it.
But Livingston continues to suffer visitors playing the exact kind of game they want, in which they successively sweep their long balls Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's side could have made it even bigger in the final stages but McGregor managed to keep Jacobs out of the way before Lithgow went wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late appeal for a penalty because he and Jacobs hung up, but Thomson didn't look back.
Almanac: The creator of Geiger Counter
And now here's a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and STILL YOU WILL BE MORE...the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany who would one day become a physicist.
Geiger developed a technique for determining and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would later deliver a device called the Geiger Counter.
An important part of science since then, the Geiger Counter has also been a major support for pop culture, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," featuring the seemingly obscure cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What’s that thing?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used in reference to radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms caused by radioactivity on minerals."
Evan: "It's definitely ringing now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the name stuck to his name.
The new vaccine against cancer teaches the immune system to "determine" harmful cells
The new vaccine against cancer teaches the immune system to "determine" harmful cells and destroy them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells
The procedure involves the removal of immune cells in the patient, and enhancing them in the laboratory
They are then able to 'identify' the protein that is common to most cancers and then inject it back into them.
Vaccines provide good results for patients with a variety of cancers.
For more than 18 months, ovarian cancer disappeared in a woman treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to identify harmful cells.
The procedure involves taking immune cells from a patient, and enhancing them in the laboratory so that they "identify" the protein common to most cancers called HER2, and then injecting the cells back.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: "Our results indicate that we have a reliable vaccine."
HER2 "causes the spread of many types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to destroy cancer cells works in the treatment of the type of leukaemia.
Kanye West joined Pro-Trump's Diatribe, Wearing a MAGA Hat, after his SNL exit.
The result was not good
The "boo" shouted Kanye West in the studio while performing Saturday Night Live after a long performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the position in 2020.
After performing his third song for the night, called Ghost Town where he was wearing a Make America Great cap, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I've talked to white people a lot of times and they say: 'How did you like Trump, he's a racist?'
If I'm concerned about racism, I should have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show in a kit featuring Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Committee on Legal Decisions about sexual exploitation complaints filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, comedian Chris Rock's footage of West's protests was uploaded on social media.
It's not clear if Rock is trying to embarrass West in the post he made.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was not stopped at the backstage about his hat.
"They stabbed me in the back.
They said, “Don’t let him get away with it.”
They've pissed me off!
And they said I was in a sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see the sunken place?" after saying that, he did "I wear Superman's own cape, because it means, you can't dictate to me what I'm supposed to do. You want the world to thrive?
Try to find love."
With his comments, the audience booed at least twice and embarrassed cast members of SNL, according to Variety reports, and there was a person there who declared in the publication: "The whole studio was wrapped in silence."
West was brought in as a sought-after replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who lost her fianc<0xC3><0xA9>, rapper Mac Miller, just a few days ago.
West's performance of the song I Love It, in which he dressed as Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "For one of the strongest wills: THANK YOU FOR PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just superstitious and without a doubt that's wonderful."
"But I choose NOT to recognize a person (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I think embraces and expresses the ideology that harms my community.
He's got freedom.
And so are we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and that he was now "the one formally recognized as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and followed in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg had the former name Snoop Lion and of course, the late music legend Prince, who changed his name and became a symbol, and later became an artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident occurred in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed through the Public Health Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been criticized for his lack of physical fitness.
Kit Harington is best known for his swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, strongly criticized the stereotype of the brusque defender, according to him such screen roles lead to young men often thinking that they need to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of harmful masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she "strongly" wanted to discuss the issue.
"I have a strong personal preference right now - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, based on the problem we see today?"
Kit believes that television is responsible for the increase in harmful masculinity due to its very sharp characters.
He continued: "What is nature and what does it teach?
What is being taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young men think they need to be this kind of guy?
I thought, ‘That’s one of the biggest questions of our time – how can we change that?’
There's something wrong with young people."
He also admitted in the interview that he will not be making any prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, as he said, "he's done on the battlefields and on horseback."
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in the rerun of Sam Shepard's True West story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently announced that he and his wife Rose had met what he considered the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on the show ‘to, it's been a way for me to have a family in the future, and for what my life will be like from here on out,' she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, who starred Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property yard in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China has reported a 14<0x25> increase in the number of new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health officials.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases have been passed on through sexual intercourse, marking a change from the past.
HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero in this way, according to Chinese health officials in a debate in Yunnan province.
However, the number of HIV and AIDS cases in China is increasing every year to 100,000 people.
HIV infection is a serious issue in China's LGBT community through sexual contact.
Homosexuality in China ended in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with a man eventually marry a woman.
Most infections are caused by a lack of sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised general access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the issue.
Maxine Waters has denied that her staff shared GOP senatorial data, insisting on "persuasive lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages for lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat's scheme of "ultra-right wing" censors and website insisted on the complaints.
"Lies, lies, and many more vile lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to the report, the released information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information came out online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill while a Senate panel was holding a hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The news came a few minutes after Kavanaugh's death.
In the Hill report, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState who linked to Waters' office announced the IP address referring to the source of the posts and provided the information of Waters' staff member.
"It's totally wrong and this unfounded accusation is a lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member - who compromised identity, personal information, and safety as a result of these deceptive and false allegations - has nothing to do with the spread of this information.
This accusation is completely false and unfounded."
Waters's remarks quickly gained traction online, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"There's anger at this denial," Fleischer wrote.
"It suggests he does not have the necessary behavior of a Member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be a contender.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He should be calm and respectful."
Fleischer went on to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' denunciation of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics have accused of being too grinning as the hearing was held on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for the presidency, has also voiced his views on Twitter.
"There's a lot of truth to it," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities regarding these deceptive complaints."
"We will make sure to identify the people responsible," he continued, "and that they will be held accountable to the law for all their activities that are harmful and that poses a danger to anyone and all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - foiled spy poof by Rowan Atkinson
It's now common to be looking for highlights for Brexit in any new film leaning towards Britain and it seems to fit in with the new version of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and made noise again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will it be a new opportunity to export the country's bizarre use of humor with a theme of how remarkable our lack of sense is?
Despite everything, Johnny English's big-eyed and snobbish look with no emissions has a license to kick things off again for the second time - more than anything else, his name suggests he's a massive comic made for places where viewers don't speak English.
He is, of course, an insane secret agent who despite his bizarre pretenses of being elegantly swabbed has a bit of Clouseau's character, who is Mr. Bean and mixed with the portion of the man who contributed a note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was also originally based on the traveller and international mystery man once played by Atkinson in what has now been sent to forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where he caused a stir in his cane.
There are one or two good scenes in this latest episode of JE.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter while wearing medieval armor and the rotor blades quickly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical humor can be seen, but too much humor has not worked and naturalized, especially with the confidence that "serious" movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now add humor as an element to it.
There was once a sense of humor that it was intended for children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's comic tropes were not as inventive and clear as Atkinson's silent-movie gags in Bean's persona.
The current premise that has been experienced in the area for a long time is that Great Britain is putting itself in a difficult situation.
A cyber-hacker infiltrates Britain's highly confidential web network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the field, causing dismay at the agent being dutiful - an embarrassingly small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the latest thing to break up the prime minister who is a proud and arrogant man, who is already suffering from total anxiety over the lack of human support for him in politics: Emma Thompson cuts down on the performance of this Mala-Teresa-May character but doesn't get too cocky from the script.
His intelligence advisers informed him that since all active spies had been compromised, he had something to bring back from those who had retired.
And what that refers to is the high school student Johnny English himself, who is now working as head teacher at an exclusive institution, but gives private lessons on how to become an undercover operative: funny ‘to do, because English provides the mala-School of Rock academy in espionage.
English was immediately summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and was reunited with former long-suffering sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, having married a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks paper in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
Batman and Robin have returned to the action in a series of mishaps in Her Majesty's Secret Service, where they encounter the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of falling for the lure of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer troubles: the villainous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough had already begun their long adventure of pranks: pretending to be waiters, they started a fire at an expensive French restaurant; they made a scene to ride undetected on Volta's luxurious yacht; and English started a massive riot when he tried to use Volta's Virtual Reality headset to become a family home.
There's no doubt that everything will be fine in that last sequence, but even if it's entertaining and clumsy, there's a taint of childlike TV drama in its entirety.
Not a big deal.
And I can't help but think of other Johnny English films: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would bring justice to his talent?
Labour has denied that it plans to allow Britons to work four days a week but that they will be paid the equivalent of five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan for Britons to have four days a week working - but they will be paid the equivalent of five days.
According to the party, they want the company's bosses to pass on the savings in the big shift in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day of rest.
This will give employees the opportunity to have a three-day weekend - but they will still be able to get the same pay back.
According to the sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and the plans for the country will be in favor of the workers.
The Trades Union Congress has endorsed the replacement of four days a week of work as a way to provide workers with opportunities in the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times that: 'The announcement of policy review is expected before the end of the year.
"It can't be done overnight but four days a week working is an ideal adapted to the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the good of the workers and for the overall strategy in the party industry."
The Labour Party was not the first to endorse such an idea, as the Green Party promised to work four days a week during its campaigning for the 2017 general election.
However, the Labour Party does not currently endorse this goal as a whole.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: "It is not the party's policy to work four days a week and the party does not take this into account."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour discussion to better explain his dream for a revolutionary economic socialism.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw power from "unspecified directors" and "persons exploiting profits" in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that it is possible that current shareholders in water companies will not get the full amount of their stake as the Labour government may impose 'reductions' for suspicious misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on the company's boards and form the Inclusive Ownership Funds which will give 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees, which will have annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" if they could change their minds over the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett has stalled for at least a week, and questions have been raised about whether the department's findings would be a reason for Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes", correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything from the FBI's possible findings that could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his partner from South Carolina.
"Yes," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened ‘to, after the accusation came out, I said, ‘Did you do this?’
He's determined, he's determined, and there's no bathing."
However, Graham's vote did not seem to change.
"I've already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and a big accusation will be needed for that," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but here's what I know: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"Not all of the people he's named are aware of this.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any change."
What is a Global Citizens Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a massive line-up of stars performing and with a similar amazing mission; the end of poverty in the world.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be attended by thousands of people who gather at Central Park's Great Lawn not only to celebrate acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to gain knowledge for the event's ultimate goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert goers need to complete a set of activities, or "acts" such as volunteering, sending an email to a global leader, making a phone call or anything else meaningful to help spread knowledge about the purpose of the event.
But how successful is the Global Citizen now that there are only 12 years left before it achieves its goal?
Is it an honest way to give people a free concert to engage people in action or simply add to what's called "clicktivism" - people feel they can make real change by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, attracting hosts of various causes.
These actions have helped to encourage world leaders to advertise provisions and ensure the equivalent of more than <0x24>37 billion that could change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 allocations and advertising derived from its actions, and at least <0x24>10 billion of these have been spent or used for fundraising.
The group estimates that secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major contributors include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and regulators in the U.K. dedicated to "helping children grow up discovering their full potential," which pledged to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after it received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can only note historically the social injustice of nutritional deficiencies," Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition's ambassador, told people at a live concert in London in April 2018.
According to the group, after more than 5,000 U.K. calls to focus on nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and youth through nutrition techniques.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking "how do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The Global citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes, we're going to fail.
But like our predecessors who large-scale action on civil rights and action against the policy of white separation from black, we will succeed, because we are stronger when together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the performers at this year's event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy for "blocking passage" to block Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington will be able to "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from being brought to market, including in the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's relations with Syria - particularly where it operates due to the invitation of the legitimate government - were only a cover for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to be energy brokers as they do in the eastern part of Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, using our Navy, to make sure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, blocked, to make sure that their exercise is not going to go to market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that considers itself to be the "voice of energy consumption" in the US.
He compared Washington's ways of dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they were all the same.
"The economic option with Iran and Russia is, roughly, to benefit and replace the energies," he said, while saying that Russia "knows what to do" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration promotes exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To achieve this, officials of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says, has caused Moscow to "control" Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the pipeline's current capacity to be 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin insists that Washington's strong opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and is an example of uneven competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be used as a tool for consumers to shop and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s response from Germany drew a strong reaction, which strengthened its stance on the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem when other states interfere in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren's "Thinking Well" to Run for President in 2020, Senator from Massachusetts says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "consider" running for president following the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman as president," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will really think deeply about running for president."
Warren commended President Donald Trump at such a meeting, and said "this country is taking it in the wrong direction.
"I'm really very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our economy," he said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren's subordinates were not convinced he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "likely" voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the movement.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's run, with 38 percent supporting a possible run and 48 percent opposing.
Other high-profile Democrats discussed in connection with the possible 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would give an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks out about track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"As my son goes through on his return, I understand other families are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the feelings our soldiers have caused on their return," he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "big problem they don't want to talk about" and said his son and other war veterans were "going back a little different, they're going back to being used to violence, asking if there's respect for anything their fellow soldiers and pilots have given to the country, and every member of the military."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, particularly female assault, interference in reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supported questioning new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported legal questioning of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or family violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who questioned the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name was not revealed in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
He said his partner abused him "and his children members of the violent gang," but U.S. officials denied his request for asylum on July 20.
He was stationed in Texas.
Lawyers of states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are the source of a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as countries facing widespread problems with gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum reversed a decision in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District of Columbia Attorney General, said in a statement Friday that the new policy is "regarding decades of state, federal, and world law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be convicted on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and that such a ban violates such principle," said the friend-of-the-court brief.
Lawyers in the brief further argued that the policy denying immigrants entry was detrimental to the U.S. economy because they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply the demand for labor."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing family abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear that is due to race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or a political opinion," Sessions said in a policy statement on June 11.
"Asylum is never intended to solve all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in rescue of survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very nerve-racking," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby boy in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute there is an ambulance with bodies coming in.
There is not enough clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their damaged homes, picking up their wet belongings, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are already overflowing, damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a back and shoulder fracture, are resting outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients are being treated for persistent severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how the massive earthquake was felt in the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he and his wife and daughter were staying.
"We don't have time to save ourselves.
I was stuck on the fallen wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, after it was gone, it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and his family.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. paper praising the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid statement on the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of electoral interference for the U.S. congress on Nov. 6, an allegation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections has become a sign of what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new stage of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to set up advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an escalating trade war in which they exchange tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariffs in the first phase of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, experts in China and the U.S. said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion column in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China, "is now intensifying bullying by releasing propaganda advertisements in our own independent newspaper."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's cherished tradition of free speech and free expression by issuing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"While in the newspaper stores here in Beijing, you will see only limited dissenting voices and you will see no real picture of the Chinese people's differing opinions about the troubling direction of the Chinese economy, because the Chinese Communist Party holds a tight grip on the media," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most popular newspapers in China avoided the offer to publish", although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Push Women Voters Away Before Midterms in Kavanaugh's Trouble, Analysts Warn
While many major Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn they will face strong reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments about it are very strong, and it appears to most registered Republicans that they want to continue voting.
Those things cannot be turned away," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill.
Reeher says he doubts Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will have enough support for the FBI's investigation to appease angry voters.
"Women can't forget what happened yesterday - they can't forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the modern group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is Near!" as they rallied in the Senate hallway because Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be unusual," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s high; it’s true.
But it could rise even further, especially among swing female voters in suburban areas and among young voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who often don't vote, even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the nominee in the Supreme Court, analysts say there could be a strong reaction if Republicans continue to confirm.
"It's been a big mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Republican Committee, said last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether to seat Kavanaugh, it's also about the way Republicans handle this issue and how they treat him," explains Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps get the Democrats elected.
However, it seems that Americans are becoming increasingly divided over who to believe in the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, when fewer are taking their side in the end.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh must have lied about his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations filed by Ford as well as at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee after swearing last week that he was abused by a drunk Kavanaugh when he was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his penis while they were at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, will launch a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company created from Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will be allowed to access for what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that the goal behind Inrupt was to "cover the whole world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
Contact lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools can be stored here.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and all at once.
What's different about the personal online data store is that the user has complete control over who will have access to what type of information.
The company calls this "self-empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring techniques, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all people.
The company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several on-staff developers who have been hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to release a complete change where all their business models will be completely reversed overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post in Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very positive for this next web season," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Clergy won the Victoria Cross in WW1 celebrated
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest military award in Britain.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "a brilliant symbol" that the stone would be exposed 100 years later from his grandfather's revered work.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in very thick fog while being bombarded by bullets from fields and machine guns."
Later, he went into the first row and led the line forward with "greatest bravery" before rushing with a field-gun and alone knocking the three of the team down.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I couldn't match but something humbling."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also dedicated a wreath of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "an honor to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of the true hero is shown by the support that so many people will give."
Fans of MMA didn't go to sleep overnight to watch Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig did.
You wake up at night to watch the Bellator 206, but you're not allowed to watch it.
The bill from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and aired live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
Around 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their presentation, audiences in the UK were surprised when the coverage changed and became Peppa Pig.
Some of them were disappointed after the fight to the death.
A Twitter fan said the move to child cartoons "seems like a bad joke."
"It's the government's policy that at 6 a.m. it's not appropriate to watch such a show so they had to transfer to the baby show," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would adjust their schedule to include future UK audiences.
"When I think about the replay, maybe we can fix it," Coker said.
"We're not going to be able to do it until Sunday morning, but we're going to do it on Sunday.
But we fix it.
Believe me, when they moved there, there was a lot of repetitive text and all of them were angry.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it has to do with the government.
I can promise that this will never happen again.
We're only going to do five matches instead of six - as we usually do - and we've tried to accommodate the fans but we've overdone it.
It was just a real problem."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘low' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't think about it until he reached secondary school that "not everyone is like him."
While speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs to be printed by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that his desire to win at the Olympics has diminished his desire to win the Olympics.
The regular inmate of the longtime show, Kirsty Young, has been on vacation for months due to illness.
On appearing as a castaway in Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "less" than the others as she grew up because "it's not socially acceptable to like both men and women."
He said: "Until now, those feelings that I was inferior to, and that I felt different, were the real things that gave me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "different," she said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexuality later.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympics became a high-profile campaigner for LGBT people and used his exit from this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries that have come out of the crime of homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that loving a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - " shocked me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years her senior, last year but said the age gap had never been a problem.
"When you go through a lot at a young age" - he first joined the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who experienced the same happiness and sadness.
The couple became parents in June, to their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "full view" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all that mattered was, 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than gold medals in the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
His son, Robert, died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of his last questions was whether they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted the front seat.
"I can't tell him you're not coming to sit in front," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only then that he really wasn't breathing and he was really dead that I accepted that he wasn't being bullied," she said.
The following year Daley fought at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew then that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the people at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice song - Proud of Heather Small - which resonated with him at the upcoming Olympics and still built his fur.

Mickelson will not be at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to adjust his condition to prevent it from becoming a sad event.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for four balls and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as is often the case with him for the United States, the five-time major winner divides his time between being a cheerleader and practicing in the range, hoping to correct anything wrong with him.
Because he has never been the most direct driver even during the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not suited for the tight Le Golf National course, where wrong shots are often a problem in the long rough.
And as if the difficult course wasn't enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, is still facing targeted British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who have lost four points starting in 12 singles matches, start warm-up, Mickelson's fight could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, as he had nothing else to say.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back and guided me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He had a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and has added a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I have a lot more to say, but that’s what happened and that’s where we thought we’d go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could mark the end of the Ryder Cup race which never matched his highest individual record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven boards, although Furyk said his presence brought some unseen benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, funny to people, and he's a good team-mate," she explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed him, this week, and it's fun to see.
It's more than just playing games."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows he'll soon lose the big one
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that it's easy to lose a sizable amount of singles in the final day of the Ryder Cup and that it can be an uncomfortable battle.
Denmark started the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros as captain took five-point lead over the Americans but narrowly missed the finish line due to a very small margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remind yourself that we only have a big one at Valderrama; we only have a big one at Brookline, and we lost there, and at Valderrama, we won, but that's a little bit," said Bjorn, in the photo, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in that team that it's not over yet.
You'll give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
It's not finished until you've placed the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus will remain.
I've said before, I'm going to focus on 12 players who are on our side, but we also know what's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Delighted at his players' performance on the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm not going to lead myself here.
There's another bug tomorrow.
You can see the individual performance, and other activities ‘there’.
It's good to go out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, the limits of your golfing skills can be tested.
That's the message you need to make the players understand, to release everything you can tomorrow.
You've got to let go of your partner and let him do the best he can."
Compared to Bjorn, rival number Jim Furyk hopes his players will perform better as individuals than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of big changes on the final day, as he was part of the winning Brookline team before being defeated when Europe displayed "Miracle and Medina."
"I remember every word here," he responded when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When the wheel goes in one direction, it carries a lot of pressure in the middle matches.
We're doing our line-up as needed and we're putting out the players because, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the award game and faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the line-up.
"This is how I made this group of players order because I think it was the best until the last," Bjorn said in his selections for singles.
Germany's new warship re-launched
Germany's newest frigate in 2014 should have been assigned to replace obsolete warships dating back to the Cold War, but it will not take place until next year due to system flaws and rising costs, local media reported.
The appointment of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to be included in the Navy in 2014, but the big project was in trouble due to serious issues after it was delivered.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
They obviously have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, the ongoing delay means that the latest warships - which are said to enable Germany to display power overseas - will be old-fashioned when they enter service, said Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited some "defects of essential software and hardware" that would have rendered the warship useless if it had been deployed on a combat mission.
The software shortages are especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be run by a crew of 120 sailors - only half the workforce of the older Bremen class frigates.
Furthermore, the ship appeared to be overloaded which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - up from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2billion.
The problems surrounding the latest frigates are becoming more and more important due to recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of Germany's parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy was "exhausted with ships yet to be deployed."
The official said the issue had grown over time, as the old ships were removed but no replacement ships were given.
He stated that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates had joined the Navy.
National Trust detects the secret life of bats
New research being conducted outside an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that this will shed light on the behavior of exotic flying mammals and will help guide future conservation activities.
The study will follow scientists at the National Trust for Scotland's common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared bats and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis on all recordings will confirm the frequency of bat calls and which specie makes which sound.
Then, a map of the habitat will be created to allow for a more detailed landscape-scale description of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to find out the benefits of habitat management activities such as the creation of prairies and what is the best way to maintain woodlands for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout the UK has been significantly reduced over the past century.
They are at risk from construction and development work affecting nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a danger, as well as flypapers and some chemicals that treat building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their habit of hunting at night their ears are more helpful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to identify insects and obstacles in the path they are traveling.
Bats are important to the NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country.
It has trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspect nests and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation even established the first and only dedicated land reserve for bats in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the best territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a good place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of veteran trees and all the nice habitats.
But there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so what we're doing here and on other properties can help us understand more about what they need to survive."
He stresses the importance of inspecting bats before performing maintenance on property because it is possible that the accidental destruction of at least one mother's nest could kill 400 women and young bats, potentially wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust Elisabeth Ferrell is urging the public to help.
He said: "We have a lot to learn about our bats and we don't know the population status of many of our species."
Ronaldo dismisses allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to file case against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape against him "fake news," saying there are people "who want to make themselves famous" using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese forward and Juventus have been accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he paid the woman <0x24>375,000 for quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
While talking to an Instagram Live video of his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, said the reports were "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," said the cameraman five times who won the Ballon d'Or.
"They want to use my name.
Normal ‘yan.
They want to be famous so that my name is mentioned, but that’s just work.
"I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations, which they called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would pursue compensation for "moral damages equal to the weight of the intrusion, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped the woman, according to papers filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who failed by "one percent."
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but they both liked it.
Mayorga also said that he went to the police and photographed his wounds at a hospital, but later agreed to a settlement because he was "feared of retaliation" and worried that "it would embarrass the public."
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking to reverse the arrangement as he continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged abuse, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK's 'lifetime regrets' for the loss of automakers
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its status as the world's leading automaker after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement it would temporarily split production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the effect of the delay on the border in the event of no Brexit deal could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 vehicles last year and 90<0x25> of which were exported to other parts of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have released their fears about leaving the EU without an agreement on how trade will work at the borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers say are the risks of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis where shares arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for vehicles made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a border disruption that the industry says could cause delays and a lack of shares.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "well-arranged to avoid such border investigations."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that will allow not only to enjoy the success of the moment but for us to take advantage of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Based on the evidence not only from Toyota but other manufacturers, we need to be able to fully continue any highly successful supply chain team."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the plant's ability to compete and eventually lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said that his members' concerns are growing: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, there is no way to get these jobs back.
A government spokesman said: "We have already presented a precise and credible plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could be delayed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as trouble with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's electoral interference, relations between Trump's aides and Russia's and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
It has been months of debate over whether Trump will impeach the deputy attorney general, and if Mueller's independence is threatened.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing wires to record their Trump conversations and the possibility of ousting the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not" confront Rosenstein but delayed the meeting to avoid conflict at a Senate judicial committee hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed full Senate voting.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There is no set date yet for that, maybe this week, maybe it will be postponed for another week because of all the other things going on in the supreme court.
But we're going to keep an eye on the press and keep it up-to-date."
Some reporters will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a press briefing at While House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to a dislike of the "shortcuts" of TV reporters, although he said: "I'm not opposed to the fact that they're so quirky."
Then, he indicated that there would be more direct ties between Trump and the press.
"The president is doing more Q<0x26>A sessions than his predecessors," he said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "We'll look at these numbers."
There will be briefings," Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States himself, it's better ‘that' than talking to me."
We're trying to do that a lot and you see we've done it a lot over the last few weeks and it's going to replace the press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week the president perhaps showed why, by displaying informality and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working with the NHS of Scotland to express their gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter now with less than six months left until the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has pledged to meet the amount of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman said: "Over the past summer, talks between the UK and EU about leaving have continued, hoping that decisions will be made this fall.
But the UK Government is also intensifying its preparations for a possible lack of agreement.
I know this is a sad time for all of you.
So I want to reiterate now how important each character's contribution is to me, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He went to the sideline and just fell there," Reed said.
Abercrombie was given oxygen by sideline coaches and medical personnel before he was placed on the stretcher and taken for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was being operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/end of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine where the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
U.S. foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp duty
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they purchase property in the UK and use the additional money to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
The move is counter to Corbyn's success in wanting to attract young voters
The UK's tax-deductible rate increases
The Treasury expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are set to charge higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and use the extra money to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as countering the success of Jeremy Corbyn's desire to attract young voters with promises to provide affordable housing and target high-income earners.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on non-tax paying individuals and companies in the UK, and additional money will be used to support the Government's intention to resolve street sleep.
The surcharge - which adds to the current stamp duty, including higher levels implemented two years ago in secondary residences and in houses purchased for rent - could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly-made properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices making it harder for first-time buyers to buy a house.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" as many foreigners shop outside of the country most of the time.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed reducing stamp duty to help younger adults buy their first home.
He blamed large construction companies for the continued high price of property by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to set aside quotas on affordable houses to fix "humiliating housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a compelling series of proposed housing reforms, including controlling rent and ending evictions "for no reason".
He also wanted to give councils greater powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my premiership to reviving the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This is a solution to the housing market problem.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and have a life here.
However, it's not right that it's so easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to be able to buy houses such as hardworking British residents.
The dream of owning a home is far too many people, and the inhumanity of sleeping on the street continues to be a real problem."
Jack Ross: 'My ambition is above all the government of Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "aspiration above all" is to be Scotland's manager when the day comes.
Scot, 42, appreciates the challenge of revitalizing the North-East club, currently in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I want to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a child, and there was always someone who seemed to call me back.
So, that opportunity will only come if I am successful in managing the club."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he has no fear of following such well-known names at such a large club, after turning down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The victory for me at the moment will be based on 'can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the arrangement and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to bring it there, but maybe I'll just consider myself a success if I can get the club back there."
Ross was only three years into his managerial career, after becoming assistant boss at Dumbarton and being part of Hearts' coaching staff for 15 months.
Subsequently, he helped Alloa recover from being relegated to the third tier, and converted St Mirren from being relegated to winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever when he was playing at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a good idea," he recalled of the snarl.
"I really believe that management suits me, more than playing.
It's funny because I was able to play the game, I was able to live it, and I had a good time.
But it was hard to play.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I’m still going through the stresses and pressures at work but the management is just right.
I've always wanted to be in charge and now I'm doing this, it's the most comfortable feeling I've had in my entire adult life."

According to the survey, 5:30pm on Saturday is the best time for a pint
The very hot summer has increased sales of struggling pubs in Britain but has put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Sales of pubs and bars rose 2.7 percent in July - but sales at restaurants dropped 4.8 percent, based on figures.
Peter Martin of business consultancy CGA, who compiled the numbers, said: "The continued sunrise and longer periods of England's expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed what happened in June, when pub sales increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants hit a lot harder.
A decrease of 1.8 percent in restaurants sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars had the strongest sales of drinks being the main merchandise, and in comparison to the two seasons, they raised more than the restaurants dropped.
Summer also has a poor effect on pub foods as the main merchandise, although not as severe as the restaurant's operators have.
People just want to go out and drink.
In managed pubs and bars beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, and food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman of RSM said: "These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors affecting the market sales of those outside their homes.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales will be even more painful when it adds to the constant pressure of expenses.

A survey of 20,000 secondary school students reveals the rise of "fake Insta" pages
The news has heightened fears of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account displayed to parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - makes social media accounts that they keep from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - referring to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened fears of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a clean "main" account displayed to parents, while they also had private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found the secret site of her 13-year-old son met a teenager urging other people to "rape me."
The research, done by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are drawn into creating internet spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as non-executive director at the annual general assembly of the government branch.
Doyle is the track and field athlete in Scotland with the most wins and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a great opportunity for those who have guided the game to benefit from his extensive experience at the global level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect for the sporting communities in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from bringing him to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm interested in standing up as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his total four golds at the Olympics and is now a regular expert on the BBC, was unable to walk after having a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month since I've had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I will recover or to what degree.
It was hard work but I was completely healed, I was again learning how to walk and now I'm exercising to be agile!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
An online survey of women's health care products that compares their mothers with their mothers'.
Breast pump companies have split opinions on the internet because of the advertising in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to dairy cows.
To mark the launch of what they say is "the world's first quietly worn breast bump," the company Elvie has released a humorous sarcastic music video advertisement to show the freedom the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of straw to play with lyrics like: “Yes, I milk myself but you can’t see a tail” and “If you haven’t noticed I haven’t shaved ‘them, my breasts are ‘that’.”
The chorus continues: "Feed, squeeze, I'll milk the babies, squeeze, squeeze, I'll milk my boobs."
The announcement, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy.
The video has already had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it downplays the "horrible" in the dairy industry.
"It's definitely not a good decision to use cattle to advertise the product.
We need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, so their offspring are just a few days away after birth," says one.

Another commented: "First-rate traumatic for mother and baby.
"Why don't you use it to help mothers who are not able to breastfeed their babies?"
Another added: "There is no advertising.
While others have defended the advertisement, a woman admitted that the song was "laughing" for her.
"It's an idea for me.
I would have bought it if I was pregnant.
I felt like I could really feel the pressure.
It's also a bit of a publicity stunt, but I think it's true.
"It's a good product," said one.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who pump (often on their jobs or decks) and feel like "cows."
It's not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women will reveal that they are all dancing with invisible pumps inside their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who pump milk say they feel like they're cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes and fits inside the nursing bra inconspicuously, so the more moving women are, the easier they can hold their babies, and even be able to get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD, commented to Mother: "Elvie Pump has made such a big change that it should be given a bold and stimulating launch.
In comparison to pumping women and cows we like to draw attention to the pumping of milk and all that's hard about it, while showing in an entertaining and first-rate way the great comfort the new pump brings.
This isn't the first time Ellie has made headlines.

Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has risen as the monthly border crossing remains unchanged, partly because it has become harder to place children on sponsors as a result of harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration.
Typically, most sponsors have also become undocumented immigrants, and fear that their own ability to stay in the country will be put in jeopardy when they receive a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit a fingerprint, and share the data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of individual sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
"We're trying to keep people safe," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials implemented new rules that would require them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days later, which was the old standard, according to those working in the shelter.
Many will be confronted by a video conference call, rather than in person, to explain their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Decisions that do not qualify for help will be quickly deported.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to be upset or sad, which can lead to severe anger or attempts to escape, according to shelter workers and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Supporters said those concerns were more severe at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are unlikely to be noticed, due to its size.
They add that moving children to a tent city without giving enough time to prepare for their emotions or to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many are already experiencing.
U.S., France and Turkey told Syria to leave immediately
While addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even after the country's eighth year of war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said it was illegal for foreign forces to remain on Syrian soil, arguing against terrorism, and "to be dealt with as it should be."
"They had to leave immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "anti-terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have had to be removed from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "oppose the sacred conflict until the expulsion of both terrorist groups from all Syrian territories" and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading irrational fear" that prompted the refugees to stay away.
"We call on the global community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing the whole humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for reconstruction for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity to resume political talks.
With the agreement between Russia and Turkey, large-scale attacks by Russian-backed Syrian forces have been averted in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear margins" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who are "extremely obliterated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members will soon be held to write the basic post-war law for Syria and allow for elections.
Moualem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, and said the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump won a second term.
With that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers might expect, his presidency ends early with a ouster and scandal.
In a nod to "The most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
Today, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime-time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped the cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, running the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was damaged in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has a different theory.
He recalls riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'I'm laughing at you,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
The confusion is amusing.
Of course, unlike other ones on TV, stories originating in Washington could affect the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families reunite, and the health of the global economy.
To not listen is a luxury that only the richest viewers can afford.
But it's beyond being a smart citizen when you've been six hours watching a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," on Paul Manafort's <0x24>15,000 bomber jacket made of ostrich skin ("a cloak of pride," says The Washington Post's opportunist, "a cloak of pride."

You'll be left with an epidural.
When I caught up with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while CNN was recording.
He couldn't leave the show, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was due to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and hang the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we were doing funny shows in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money from outside is flooding in Congress's most pressing fight in the midterm elections
It's no surprise that cash floods in Pennsylvania's 17th, thanks to a change in congressional districts that resulted in the two currently sitting for the same position.
A recent contender for redistricting in Pittsburg is Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won a seat in another district in a special election in the spring.
Lamb is running against another current Republican sitting Keith Rothfus, who is currently the representative of Pennsylvania's old 12th district, who is really overtaken by the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that the old districts were manipulating unlawfully in favor of Republicans.
The battle for the new 17th began a campaign fund battle between the major party's financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after winning very little in a March special election that was watched by many for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The Republican has held the post for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats very little.
U.S. balances El Salvador's punishment for supporting China, then backs off
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a well-organized meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's ruling group.
State Department officials have decided to send back American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But only the sanctions against El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in aid from America in 2017, were taken into account, including for narcotics controls, development support and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which include financial aid cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would have been very painful for the Central American country and the high levels of unemployment and execution there.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic development to follow a similar one-year meeting that was seen as a forward step toward preventing migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to continue, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is set to speak at the conference, which will be held in mid-October, as a sign of the administration's appreciation for the gathering, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal talks on condition that they not be named.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration and also spoke on condition that he not be named.
Let's learn the history
What will happen next is special counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice, which now has plenty of evidence in the public register.
Mr. Mueller is now directing his investigation into whether Trump's campaign in Russia conspired with his attack on our elections.
If the holder changes to Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility for this branch, as he prepares to re-elect, and perhaps eventually face a jury composed of his counterparts.
That's a lot if that, and I'm not saying it's inevitable the downfall of Mr. Trump - or his European counterparts.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have a lot of decisions to make that will affect how long the conflict lasts.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a coup d'<0xC3><0xA9>tat against Hitler, if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed the chance to avoid the next three years of murder.
The course of history revolves around such points of change of direction, and accelerates or delays the irresistible progress of democracy.
Americans are facing some of the points of this change now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person controlling the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in doubt since this newspaper reported that, last year, he secretly proposed recording the president and even gave speculation that the president was not appropriate for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' account is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I.'s newly requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he can be confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail those tests, the winter of democracy will be long.
But I don't think we're going to fail, because of the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my home as ambassador.
He survived, went to America and, 60 years later, lit me with Sabbath candles on that table marked with a swastika.
Because of that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about the upcoming match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following Spain's impressive draw against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League's Group G.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans out of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believed the Rangers could use that result as a boost to bigger things.
"It's a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and came out with a point.
We could have done it in the end, but overall, it's probably a good result.
Maybe they were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
Thursday was a big night in Europe.
I hope we get three points but the game is going to be tough because they had a good result in their last game, but people supported us, so I'm sure we'll fight and get a positive result.
Last year was really tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a good feeling in place right now.
The team was great and the members really enjoyed; the training was good.
We hope that we can fight now, put the past season aside and be successful."
Women's health care workers are afraid of retirement
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their family members about it.
About half the number of individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their wives about the value of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they're not taking any steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's business life insurance.
That's where it can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't say your wishes in advance.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these decisions will be of great value.
Include your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you to find ways to cover those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help meet these costs or insure yourself with your own money - if you have the money.
Fix your legal documents: Try to avoid legal problems.
Have a health care proxy so that you can appoint a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes in case you can't speak.
You should also consider having a power of attorney for your finances.
A trusted person will choose you to make financial decisions for you and will make sure your bills are paid when you can't afford to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
These details are explained in a written plan for you to be prepared.
"It's not just money, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to prepare the plan."
Man shot multiple times by air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he walked home one night.
The victim, who is in her late 40s, was at Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "a casual act."
The victim did not see the victim.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police appealed to eyewitnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the lines of communication were broken, officials of the relief agencies were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some basic information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the provincial capital of Central Sulawesi, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency located over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency had an estimated population of 299,200 as of 2017[update], which is an administrative region lower than the province.
Fishing and cultivation are the main economic sources of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of it is located in Morowali, on the other coast of Sulawesi.
Tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly experiences earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the northern part of Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, 226,000 people died off the coast of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of major earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of places and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing devastation and fear as people remembered the devastation caused by the massive earthquake and the 2004 tsunami.
No tsunami followed this time, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and put thousands of tourists in temporary distress.
Sarah Palin's ex-husband charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of racketeering.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of family violence, interference in reporting family violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance attempted to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin took the phone with her.
Palin was detained at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and in custody on the basis of a <0x24>500 unsecured bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, sure" when asked about his defense, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could face up to a year in prison and be fined <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged with Class B misdemeanor, with a one-day jail sentence and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time the criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged injury.
The case is currently in the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the reporting of domestic violence, and being armed while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said that Palin punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent actions to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake prompted a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity has been cut and communication lines are disrupted and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the immediate aftermath of the earthquake.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspect in terror attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terror attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, plowing through pedestrians and bicycles along his path in October.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors had to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are likely to face the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed 22 indictments against Saipov including eight counts of extortion-support killings, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and was accused of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "great preparation and planning," and described Saipov's way of carrying it out as "malicious, brutal and infamous."
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused pain, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York was prosecuted for capital punishment.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was later sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were hanged after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years ago.
Rosenberg was hanged in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, police said.
He admitted no offence at 22 perfect.
David Patto, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "disappointed" by the decision of the prosecution.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting the admission of guilt for life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma these events have caused to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations according to Tory MP
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today in protest at the Tory conference.
Former Ukip leader said what politicians need is to 'feel the pressure' from Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested she should be in charge of EU negotiations.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the UK would have 'got out now' if Mr Farage were the Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's challenge to reconcile her divided group was highlighted by the Tory's joining in favour of Stay in a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The premier finds it difficult to keep the pace of his Chequers compromise plan in the midst of attacks from Brexit favors, those who want to stay and the EU.
The allies insisted that he would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the adverse reaction - and forced the Eurosceptics and the Labour to choose between his plan and the 'trouble'.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'throw away the Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit but we need to scrap Chequers.'
In a statement, he said: "We don't fight world wars just for the sake of survival.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 poll: "It's not entirely true the idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay."
The Tory in Favor of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: 'What I'm saying is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The general public doesn't like Chequers, the Opposition doesn't vote for it, our party and our activists don't like it who walk the streets and elect us.
Please, please, forget the Chequers and start listening."
In an in-depth message to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers will remain in office if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said politicians at the rally would have to "feel pressure" if they intended to abandon the decision made during the 2016 referendum.
"It's now about the trust between us - the people - and our politicians," he said.
"They're trying to give up Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we're not going to let you do ‘that'.
In a message to enthusiastic groups of people he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our politicians, who intend to abandon Brexit.
"We are moving the army of the people in this country who have given us victory in Brexit and we will not stop until we are free, govern ourselves, high-ranking United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who wanted to Stay marched to Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
There are widespread activists waving flags of the Tory Versus Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis criticized the Conservatives for security issues they suffered in a party app at the opening of the conference.
"It's the people who tell us they can put in place IT systems and all the technology for Canada and more, so there's no border conflict, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's just a laugh.
"There's nothing better than Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "think deeply" about running for president
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she would "consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He is already in the midst of speculation that he will fight Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke marks his 36th meeting with constituents using the format of the town hall since Trump took office.
One of them asked him if he wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman as president."
A man has been arrested in connection with the death of Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., on Saturday announced that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting and killing of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. news conference of the ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet in the head that killed him," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the crime scene, handgunned, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the world title after team orders gave him the win from Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team order would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in his defensive position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to tackle his teammate.
Vettel first stopped in the pit and left Hamilton to end up in traffic at the end of the group, something that should have decided on the result.
Mercedes pitted after a lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead after a scream in which the Ferrari driver hesitated to leave the inside of the free throw at the risk of continuing to defend after a double-move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh late on the first lap on his 21st birthday.
Subsequently, he took the lead for much of the race as he continued to race to target a quick finish and would outscore Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
He eventually stopped pitting on the 44th lap but was unable to speed up the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took the fourth.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri did a good job all weekend and it really made me feel like a gentleman and a gentleman.
"We've done a great job of getting one," Hamilton said.
It’s really bad for the body.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she did not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate showed that people were "cruel and evil and lying."
"It's something that can happen and the good that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry and cruel and evil and lying," he said.
“When you see what has been revealed and what has been revealed after they have said, ‘Ah, I am not the one who has done that’.
I'm not the one doing that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you the one who baptized?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the document - "ah, ah, what?
Ah, no.
I'm not the one who was baptized."
Just wait.
"We're not going to be baptized," he added, as the senator imitated him.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was revealed in early September - but Feinstein denied that his office had disclosed them.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I did as he asked."
But his rejection of the president was not good enough, commenting at the rally on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you, it’s really bad body movement’.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but ‘that’s the worst body movement I’ve ever seen.’
Continuing with her defense of the nominee in the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by the three women, the president said the Democrats were using the allegations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see the brutality, the evil, they don't care who gets hurt, who they're going to try to get power for," the Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars returned to defeat the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 for Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored just two goals with strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the home side before Dwyer returned the Giants' only.
Francois Bouchard tied the game for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals in the victory.
This is the third Elite League loss of the season for Adam Keefe, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth appearance of the season by two sides, the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opener came in in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, and David Rutherford provided an assist as Beauvillier doubled it just four minutes later.
In the busy opening period, Sullivan put the home side back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie's bat at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead in the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side rallied again and Bouchard levelled them again with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee just the first time in the game in the final part of the second period and secured the win in his team's fifth half-way to the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will head home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies While ensuring Hundreds of Plane Survive Earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been called a hero after his death while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to rock the area and many are trapped in the ruined buildings in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues' evacuation to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu airport.
He stayed behind to ensure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to fly safely.
Then, he jumped into the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We took a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, as according to the country's disaster mitigation agency, access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number is still rising because many more bodies are under the collapsed buildings while others are inaccessible," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six meters destroyed Palu which would hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
In turn, military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute there is an ambulance coming with bodies.
Clean water is not enough.
Small shops are being looted all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every evacuation task.
"Are you ready?" asked CNN.
Indonesia was hit in the first part of this year by the Lombok earthquake in which more than 550 people were killed.
Micronesia plane crash: According to Air Niugini a man is missing after plane crashes into lake
The airline operating the plane that crashed in the Pacific lake of Micronesia now says there is one man missing, after it was first said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that on Saturday afternoon, a male passenger could not be found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remain in hospital on Saturday, and all are in good condition.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed on the lake and did not reach the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane passed over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
“It’s a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were able to walk in the water up to the waist to emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said flight attendants were frightened and screaming, and that he had sustained minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors repairing a nearby harbor also helped rescue the sailors by using a steamboat to get people ashore before the plane sank some 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in the crashes of airlines registered with PNG in the past two decades but no Air Niugini has been involved.
The story of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its argument on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of arson for life to a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Examiner Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to patch up the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting Tellis' earlier statement, Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that the man's cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was in a different location that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another mismatch was Tellis' statement that he had known Chambers for about two weeks at the time of his death.
According to reports, the two had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers's death, Tellis erased Chambers's texts, calls and contact information on his phone.
"He's ruined the girl in his life," Hale said.
The defense is set to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury trial to go ahead that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The three hip hops want to challenge the negative outlook on the genre by putting positive messages into their music.
The High Breed, which is from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots in political message and response to social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and shine the conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common by artists such as Akala and Lowkey are getting back to life in the UK.
It's black again?!
A NY nurse sues a married couple for leaving her job after "racist" text
A New York nurse sues the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a mistransmitted text from the mother complaining that she is "black again."
The couple denied that they were racist, and compared the lawsuit to "treason."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who has two children, expressed disappointment when she learned that her children's new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day at work in 2016.
"NIIIIIIIIII Black Name," Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text to his wife.
So, instead of sending it to his wife, he was able to send it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After learning of his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, saying that their former stepdaughter, who is African-American, had done a poor job, and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day at work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for being laid off, and asks for <0x24>350 a day for a six-month, stay-in job he would have had, even without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding that "I know it's discriminatory."
The couple broke off on charges that they were racist, saying that removing Maurice from the job was justified, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after they hurt his feelings.
"My wife sent me a text message that she didn't really mean to say.
He's not racist.
We are not racists," wife Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Do you trust your children with someone you've abused, even if it's not intentional?
Your new-born baby?
It’s not.”
While comparing the lawsuit to "sucking," Plasco said that it was only two months after his wife gave birth and was "very much in trouble with the situation."
"You're going to kill someone like that?
It’s not a good idea, but an investment banker.
As the case progressed, the public quickly denounced the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won't like talking bear, exposing new letter
Said of Bond's son Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before it's published.
It's nice to know now what we know about Paddington's great success."
Still confident even if his work is rejected, he says of his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before drawing inspiration from the little bear toy who wrote the children's book, and he added that it was "happy and sad" the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family," adding that his father was proud of the eventual success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not proud," she said.
"But since Paddington is true for him, it's like your child achieves something: you're proud of them even if you're not the one who did it.
I think that's how he sees Paddington's success.
Although it was created by him and his imagination, he gave the honor to Paddington himself."
I said goodbye on the phone as my son died.
His son was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried but failed to save his life.
"Nad has been called up to say that he's really serious, that there's no hope for him to survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then, I got a call from Ned saying he was going to die within the next couple of minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
“And that’s what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, son.
I'll be there soon.
I'll go with you.
He's slowly losing his balance and the drugs he's been given by the doctors to keep his heart pumping.
He was dead before and “that’s all that’s been shut down.
I can't help but sit there and wait, as I know it's all happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because there were so many families and people around me.
I had to stop it all."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already grieving the death of her son, was on the plane with the rest of the passengers - unaware of where she was going.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I just started crying, I didn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane I felt so sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves the boy."
Women who are trying to get rid of cards to stop handcuffing on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are struggling to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on the Welsh bridge cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms Davis's son Tyler was 13 when she began to suffer depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel how I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son hopes to become a chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
She always said that her smile was beautiful."
Unfortunately, he left the job before he died, because "he was really very sad."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother saw his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that it will have an effect."
Ms Davis made the cards, "to tell people that they have somewhere to go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet - you need to talk to someone."
Ms Humphreys, who had been a friend of Ms Davies for some years, was left by Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother's passing.
"She didn't say she was sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
She was very sad on Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts she didn't stand by them."
He said his death was a great trauma to them, but they had to accept it: "It's really a huge loss to the family.
We were divided.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Next day Brett Kavanaugh suspended as FBI begins investigation
"I thought, if we could do something as he demanded - an investigation into the limited time, limited scope - there would be at least a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "broken" in the midst of the hardening of the parties.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reason for this is because of all the time.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans fail to succeed, they become too weak in their attempts to get elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls for Senators, addresses them in support of Mr Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr Bush and through this he met his wife Ashley, who was then Mr Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
There will be voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It's unclear if Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to settle the ballot and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors 'decreased' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there had been 1,127 defects last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges of human smugglers were a big deal.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the tightly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
In recent months relations between the North and the South - which are in fact still enemies - have improved greatly.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at stalled negotiations on denuclearisation.
It comes after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on general terms for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the US, there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, we would never be able to disarm," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "too noisy," unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "too noisy" and said that because of her conduct she was not eligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman acted like that, they would say 'too noisy,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when she denied allegations that she sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming on several occasions and crying while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "degenerate and coordinated slander" orchestrated by liberals in Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed he was not in favor of the Democrats.
"I think he qualifies himself with those statements and the way he denounces the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if he would try to oust Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats would get a majority in the lower house.
"I'm going to say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, that means he doesn't deserve not only the Supreme Court, but also the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for a noisy and prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that nice ‘you','" Pelosi said.
And Women Have to Use It.
It's a reasonable denunciation, overflowing with months and years of anger, and he can't bring it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I think it’s normal, isn’t it?”
She continued, "A female executive in one area helped me a lot, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but she did so when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You think I'm probably sad because I'm crying.
I was angry."
And he continued.
I think it’s great.”
Tears are allowed as a way of releasing anger because first of all they are misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from my previous jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I cried with irresistible anger, was grabbing me by the collar of an older woman - a hostile manager whom I had always feared - and dragging me down a staircase.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy that you're crying."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on her presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught cheating on his wife in a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the fight, Ms. Schroeder, who was really disappointed, thought there was no reason for him not to consider running for president himself.
“I don’t think it’s a good idea to make that decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There are seven candidates, and they don't need another one.
One person called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign began long ago, he was left behind in fundraising, so he promised not to participate in the fight unless he raised <0x24>2 million.
There’s no such thing as a “difficult fight.”
He discovered that some of his supporters who would give <0x24>1,000 to the men would only give him <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'm being disingenuous?" he asked.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was filled with emotion - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration at a system where it was very difficult to gather money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger at gender discrimination - so she cried.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press had reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was the sponsor for me.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"He was crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war will benefit Beijing
The beginnings of the trade war between the U.S. and China are puzzling, and while the conflict is far from over, the long-term rift between the countries may be good for Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week entered the biggest surge in new ventures affecting the <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, which in fact imposes a tax on half of all goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing retaliates every time, most recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion of goods from the United States.
China has promised to commit to the U.S. in every move, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will blink in the near future.
For Washington to back down, it will have to give up on demands, but an open surrender to the US would be a disgrace for <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing behaves well, China's support of US pressures on the long-term trade war will be positive by lowering the level of ties between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic integration in either of the two countries, is even more dangerous than observers have admitted in the past," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in the country's resurgence devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to work on rehabilitation in areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to bring everything back to normal.
There are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they left because of terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
And six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the regime in Syria is open to aid in the revival of the devastated country.
But he insisted that he would not receive conditional aid or assistance from countries that had supported the uprising.
Winner of the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA by a final score of 16.5 out of 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
The tee-shot of US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, fell into the water at the par-3 16th hole, and he conceded defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shone through all his rounds, becoming a 1-in-4 player to have 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5<0x26>4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson fell 2nd and 1st to England's Ian Poulter who may have been in his last Ryder Cup game.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Sergio Garcia, was the tournament's most successful player of all time with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop now.
This man was difficult.
So I'm thankful for Thomas and he chose me and he believed in me.
I was so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to help," said Garcia, who became emotional, following the victory in Europe.
He passed the role to his compatriot John Ram who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods by 2<0x26>1 in the singles game on Sunday.
"I'm really proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A unique statistic of one of the best players of all time, winning 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled throughout the weekend to find fairways other than Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these people, they fought.
There was a moment this morning that we were a little bit hard on Europe.
We fought.
Say hello to Thomas.
He was a good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will be together again, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 years and am proud to serve as a captain.
You're really welcome.
They're just better."
Red Tide Update: Decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decline in Red Tide concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
