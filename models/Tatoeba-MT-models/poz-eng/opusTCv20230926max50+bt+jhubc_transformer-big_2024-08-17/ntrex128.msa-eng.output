The Welsh Council (AM) is concerned about 'looking like a doll'
There is concern among some AMs over the proposal for their title to be changed to MWP (Member of Parliament of Wales).
It arose because of a plan to change the name of the conference to the Parliament of Wales.
I'm concerned that the whole political spectrum may invite ridicule.
An AM from the Labour Party said, his party cares ‘he rhymes with ‘Twp' and ‘Pwp'.
To readers outside Wales: In Wales, ‘twp' means ‘mad' and ‘pwp' means ‘unclean.'
AM of Plaid said his party as a whole was "not happy" and had proposed an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was "open-minded" about the name change, but said it was a brief verbal jump from MWP to Dolls.
In this context, the Welsh letter ‘w' is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter ‘u.'
The Council Commission, which is drafting a law to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision on any so-called Councillor should be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorizes the Welsh council to change its name.
In June, the Commission informed the results of public consultations on a proposal that had broad support to call the council the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the AM title, the Commission is favored by Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option receives the most support in public consultation.
AM appears to be proposing an alternative option, but is troubled to reach an agreement and could oust Honorary Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within weeks.
Laws on reform include other changes according to the way the council works, including rules on AM disqualification and the design of committee systems.
I'm going to get a final vote on what to say when they debate the law.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia."
The popular vote was set up in an attempt to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its offer of membership for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vocal opponent of the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just the price to pay to join the EU and NATO union.
St. Martin's bells are silent because churches are struggling in Harlem
"The old man I met said, historically, there were bars and churches on every street corner," Mr Adams said.
"They're both gone now."
He said the loss of the bar was understandable.
"People are social in different ways right now," he said.
"Bar is no longer a living room in a neighborhood where people will always go."
As for the church, he fears money from asset sales won't last as long as leaders expect it, "and sooner or later they'll be back where they started."
Churches, he said, could be replaced with apartment buildings and condominiums inhabited by people who did not want to help maintain the remaining sanctuary in the neighborhood.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in this building are white people," he said, "and therefore will have these churches closed altogether because it is unlikely that most people who enter these condominiums will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved in the 1930s.
The nearby black church had taken possession of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by blacks under the Honourable John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which opposed hiring or promoting blacks in employment.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Pastor Johnson made plans to rebuild, they ordered the tower bells.
David Johnson, the son and successor of Priest Johnson in St. Martin, proudly referred to the tower bell as ‘the bell of the poor.’
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: ‘Cultural treasures' and ‘historical instruments that cannot be replaced.'
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played at St Martin's over the past few months has been a hassle to architects and contractors, some brought by church leaders, others by the Episcopal bishop.
The Vestry Chamber - the congregation's administrative body, which consists of public leaders - wrote the bishop in July with concerns the bishop "will seek to approve the cost" for the vestry chamber, although the vestry chamber was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors brought in by the bishop.
Some church members complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Shark injures 13-year-old boy while diving in search of coral shrimp in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving in search of a crayfish in California on the opening day of the crayfish season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled along with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a fun scream to catch a shrimp, but he "didn't realize that the boy was screaming, "I have to bite!
I've got to bite!"
His entire collarbone has been torn open," Hammel said, noticing when he got the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that sharks had been found in the area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed to be a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury to his upper body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury takes Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams from a beauty style room in a department store run by an expert assistant.
As part of an effort to enter the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while fashion and home appliance sales return, larger beauty spaces will be tested in 11 stores across the country and brought to more stores next year if they come to fruition.
Investment in beauty comes as supermarkets look for ways to use the previously claimed shelf space for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double the size of its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The range of existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with similar branded parts as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched Boutique's range of make-up products to make the majority of its products vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly in demand by shoppers from young people.
Fragrance Shop perfume dealers will test concessions at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and turning towards buying a little food every day at a local convenience store means the supermarket has to work harder to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said the branch would look like a convenience store as the supermarket chain tries to fight Aldi and Lidl's big business with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos branches in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several venues since it bought both chains two years ago, said to have increased retail sales and made turnover more profitable.
The supermarkets had previously wanted to modify the beauty and pharmaceutical parts that ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boot in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after disagreements over how to split the revenue from the pharmacy store in the supermarket.
Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a role in the show, adding a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've changed the look and appearance of our beauty space to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest with friends who are specially trained to be willing to offer advice.
Our range of brands are designed to meet every need, and an attractive environment and comfortable location means we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'overwhelmed' after Holly Willoughby pulled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million bid
Peter Jones, star of Dragons' Den, 'over' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contract with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for household items and accessories from the Truly Brand.
The couple's business was likened to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning presenter, 37, used Instagram to announce that he would quit.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones, in a fit of rage by pulling out of the lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her new incredible contract with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "over" when the successful TV woman admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she had no time to devote to home goods and accessories from the Truly brand.
The business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation homes.
Sources said: "Over the years, it's really been Holly's priority.
It will be his long-term future that can see him through the next few decades.
The decision to pull out everyone involved was truly shocking.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it's so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters that is ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of the presenter This Morning, which is one of the most acceptable stars at banks in Britain, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and home goods, and potentially delay its launch.
It could be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children and husband Dan Baldwin has been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby formed Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has a 40<0x25> stake in Baldwin, a TV production firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's lawyer in the program I'm A Celebrity'.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business dealings."
"We're in love and then we're in love"
He joked about the criticism the news media would receive for making reviews that some would consider ‘unfair to the president' and very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump giving up so much?
Trump said by voting ‘news readers.’
"I never gave up on losing."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was named by Trump as a major step towards the cessation of North Korea's nuclear program.
But the nuclear program has been suspended.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "similar response" from the United States about North Korea's initial ceasefire movement.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continued sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his rally speech.
“Our relationship with North Korea is good,” he said.
"We will go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and bringing the bodies of former American soldiers back home.
And he defended his extraordinary approach in talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him directly.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Islands, Kill Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been evacuated, no national disaster has been declared, as a condition for claiming international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they clearly did not ask for international help, so it was quite challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children together in a team went to Palu, it was uncertain whether foreign staff could work on the scene.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Based on the earthquake that often faced Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other beaches.
The lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although warnings have come into force, is like contributing to the loss of life.
In the best of times, traveling between the islands of Indonesia is indeed challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to care for the quake victims was heading to Palu, but it took at least three days to get to the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made poor infrastructure improvements a key factor in his election campaign, and he has given high allocations to roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has hit Jokowi's administration as he faces re-election next year.
Jokowi faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have accepted a more conservative understanding of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge equalised against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri when about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal with his side leading 1-0.
He kicked the ball to the left before kicking towards the away goal net.
The attempt soared above the goal as it drifted towards the top-right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball fell over Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always carry the ball as far as possible, so I'm trying to relax as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and make a shot and don't think long and make a shot at it."
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after scoring in the 25th minute from Belgium star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before hovering midfield and running into Liverpool's centre.
Kovacic gives and sends can quickly be in the middle.
He then unleashed a beautiful kick, bringing Hazard into goal.
Danger passed the defence and scored a goal away with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becke.
Liverpool beat Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped under the rubble of buildings that were flooded in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered a 20-foot-high wave, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, is littered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
The murder investigation was carried out after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, with the 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard nothing to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I appeal to anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard camera futej to contact us as they may have information that is important to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found was a local Birkenhead resident and she was found inside her home.
In the afternoon, friends who believed they knew the woman had arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police say an investigation is under way, they are in the process of informing the victim's heirs.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews had just tried to break into his apartment but was told by police no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was stunned when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told the investigation took hours until they were allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He kept repeating "it's so horrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another van outside.
Some of the officers were standing inside the cordon monitoring the partition apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing log 247 from September 30.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament is the latest memorial to be hit by 'rewrite history'
His removal would be poetic justice for destruction like his Taliban with so much of England's artifact and religious culture being perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as ‘stupid' and ‘trying to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate about the removal of the statues to which Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster will be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English civil war was either not directed or run by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed because of the actions of Thomas' ancestors in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful representation of Cromwella is 19th-century evidence and part of the history of figures many believe are still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in the situation of the monarchy.
Whether it is a full-fledged representation becomes the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped our country's subsequent development, and Cromwell is an individual known as a figure who represents a divided part.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and commemorated."
The pig is killing Chinese farmers.
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery, filled with blood near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject a vaccine into a pig on May 30, 2005 in <0x58>ining Province of Qinghai, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and found a pig door next door open.
He said in the pig kennel was a large male pig with its mouth bleeding.
Forensic inspections confirmed that 550-pound pigs had beaten farmers to death, according to the report.
"His family," Wu said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the store at 4.40am Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent it from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon farmers were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs aren't always aggressive but a taste of blood can act as "triggers."
They're just kidding.
They're nippers, so curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to pay the right amount of respect," he said.
Over Typhoon Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved into cold water waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rain in northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. next day.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, until 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough that begins to form in the Pacific Ocean and moves east towards the U.S. West Coast as Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push the tropical north southwesterly U.S..
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacts with the approaching trough that creates heavy rain in the Southwest the following day.
Within the country, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, streams of debris and landslides likely in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially more so than Arizona.
Flash floods may be in severe conditions due to the distribution of tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to venture into the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to stagger and thunderstorms that will bring the country strong winds and blowing dust.
The approaching trough will bring heavy rain on parts of Southern California's coast.
Rainfall amounts of more than half an inch are possible, which can lead to small streams of debris and slippery roads.
This is the first rain in the region during the dry season.
Some tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before it becomes further late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
In October it can see some intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic becomes cooler, but the tropics remain slightly warmer.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes with short-range temperatures.
There is a great example of a temperature difference through the U.S. center on Sunday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat of the summer will continue to try to build and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to witness a warm start to October with the 80s extending from the Southern Plains to the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which estimates 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people witnessed the shocking testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of being sexually assaulted allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for a last-minute touch Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh groped him and tried to unmask him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his testimony, said that 100 percent would not happen.
It was probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company counts average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers are not immediately available for other networks showing PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching in the office.
To put it in perspective, it's the size of an audience equal to a football game or an Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, which thinks the host has supported Kavanaugh's appointment, leads the entire network with an average of 5.69 million viewers while listening throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The benefits remain high after listening.
Flake is the main character in this Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested as CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning were shouted at by protesters as he attempted to climb the elevator to the Judicial Committee hearing.
He stood with his disabled eyes for a few minutes while he preached, live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"You think he's telling the truth?"
He was told, "You have power when a lot of women don't have power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, he would say a lot at a committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered the hour live later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look at allegations against nominees next week, minority democrats urged.
Flake is convinced part of the conversation with his friend, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation between Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice does have power, as it's clear Republicans won't have a vote to pass Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and of undermining the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another joint interview with him on the front page of the paper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack said to be Checkers for Brexit, saying Britain's and EU reserves should collect tariffs each "completely senseless."
Wayde Sims shooter: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson with death of LSU player
Police have arrested the suspect in shooting dead Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed in jail on two-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde physically dead.
The bond has been set at <0x24>350,000, the Advocate reports.
Eastern Baton Rouge's East Coroner's Office issued a report early Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police and the local people with assisting with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their “struggle and justice efforts”.
Sims is 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocking" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
Dust spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano all the way to the south of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from volcanoes after heightened activity in the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and dust for 24 hours.
The center monitors various tremors and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of car windshield covered in a layer of ash in a residential area in Mexico City such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with followers of Catalan sensibilities ahead of independence anniversary vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization election.
A group of masked pro-separators held by riot police threw them with eggs and released paint powder, making dark clouds in the streets that tourists are used to.
The fight also took place later with the police using their batons to fight.
Hours later pro-independence groups chanted "Not forgetting, no forgiveness" facing unionist protesters who shouted, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remained high in the region a year after the October 1 vote was deemed illegal by Madrid but welcomed by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for his candidacy to be independent, although the exit percentage of voting was low with those who opposed secession largely boycotting the vote.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop elections taking place at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer expected Catalonia's prospects of independence.
“Last year we went through one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
While management is crucial if it comes close to winning regional elections in December, the Catalan pro-independence party has struggled to maintain momentum this year with its many well-known leaders either in exile or in custody to await trial for their role in organising the referendum and independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests against police support on her phone, said the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison before a trial since the end of last year, announced he would contest next year's European Parliament election.
"Winning as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the oppression we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after being hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the same car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the door and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have opened fire on the car at some point.
Menga's attack gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston wins
Livingston's rise surprised Rangers to give up Steven Gerrard to a second defeat in 18 matches as Ibrox club manager.
Dolly Menga's attack proved to be different when Gary Holt's team moved up with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face head coach Hearts, whom they will track with eight points on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended the run unbeaten in this division to six games, with head coach Holt still feeling the loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Winston lost his chance against the other side.
Holt's team should have been far ahead before scoring, with their involvement causing the Rangers to face all the problems.
Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his effort past the goal, but Alan Lithgow was only able to give up his effort after sliding over Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts are eager to let the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they can give the opponent trouble with a set cut.
And that's the way in which important goals exist.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston opened the blinds, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to set up Menga, who took a touch and goal from the centre of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had mastered the possession but had found a home defence that could not penetrate and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely out of trouble.
The pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a save for Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored from another Livingston match.
Crosses went straight into Livingston's box and continued to clean up, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - bounced away.
'The Phenomenon' of Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
To men, they are very brilliant, continuing to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have barely changed since returning to the top ranks, but great credit is forced to go to Holt for him to launch the team since he arrived.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was very brave, embodying a great defense of order, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over the toes.
The Rangers are less inspiring, though.
Good as they are sometimes under Gerrard, they fall far from that standard.
The latter ball was somewhat lacking – only once they cut the home team – and it was a call for the Rangers to wake up, who found themselves at the mid table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has received a number of awards in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They talked about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's participation in the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many nearby supporters wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The war protests depicted the happiness of a visitor who was hailed as a hero by some Turks and fired as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: Biker dies in collision with car
The cyclist died in a collision involving a train in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The incident came a few months after another cyclist died in a run-off on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his heirs.
Road closures and on-site bus detours and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison officials were injured in a disturbance at the high-security men's prison, the Prison Office said.
The disruption occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at approximately 9:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
The "Tornado" Specialist Officer was brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involved eight occupants and had one wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Trained prison personnel have been assigned to deal with what is happening at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and obviously they are responsible for referring to the police and can spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, the governor of the prison reportedly received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officials were called to prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flash Flooding (Dry Areas Benefiting)
It's rare for tropical depressions to hit Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rosa's wind energy track crosses the Desert Southwest, risking flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for Arizona west to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the route over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late last night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet only "ten tropical tornadoes remain hurricanes or depressed status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's latest model predicts 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches deep in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the Desert Southwest including the Rockies center and the Great Basin will probably get 1 to 2 inches, with remote numbers so it may be 4 inches.
For those at risk of flash flooding, Rosa's rain may have been a blessing since the region was hit by drought.
While flooding is a serious concern, some rain will benefit since the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to U.S. Drought Monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences the worst drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which has hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm faces cold waters in the Pacific and therefore generates a descent.
Therefore, it is expected that the landfall in Mexico will be at the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico can be severe, causing the risk of major flooding.
"The amount of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, so it's probably 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then will track through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger from Rosa or debris is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rains are expected to result in life-threatening flash floods and streams of debris in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained "stable".
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested yesterday in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officers are appealing to those who may have a mobile phone recording of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered, meaningless, angry' Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote was a vote to reject violent and outrageous tactics in the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered tremendously, angrily" the Democratic Party throughout the process of his candidacy.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, firmly and emotionally denying allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted him during her teenage years.
Ford also testified to a hearing on his allegations.
The president said on Saturday "the American people saw the excellence and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh on that day.
"One vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds at the moment, a lawmaker with an outstanding record in the public service," he told the crowd supporting West Virginia.
The president simultaneously referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of Republican elections in the general election.
"Five more weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn’t run, but I actually ran,” he said.
"That's why I'm in a place fighting for a great candidate."
Trump argues that Democrats are on a mission to "oppose and hinder."
The first major vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be made no later than Friday, the GOP's senior aide's leadership has told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake, tsunami, with toll rising
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by a giant wave that crashed on the coast, as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18-foot) wave slammed into the ground at dusk, sweeping away many deaths and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came up yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach and not running and eventually they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster capture agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami doesn't come by itself, it drags cars, logs, houses, it strikes everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the edge.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been moved to 24 centres in Paluu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The final storm continues to rock the city by the beach on Saturday.
Several aftershocks were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Study and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami wave, the agency said.
Nugroho described the destruction as "expanding" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building and said another 540 people were injured and 29 people were still missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and destruction may have been more devastating along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala. It was close to the epicenter of the quake.
"Communication was completely cut off without any information from Donggala," Nugroho said.
"Approximately 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy but it could be even worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was heavily criticised on Saturday for failing to announce that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the tsunami occurred during the warning period.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man's voice was heard screaming at people on the street about the presence of a tsunami.
Within minutes, a tsunami wave slammed into the beach and pulled together buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the video.
The quake and tsunami resulted in a massive power outage that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military has sent aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities but the displaced population still needs food and other basic necessities, authorities said.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800.
It's so bad.
When the World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city, they went through the scene of the disaster. The workers took shelter under tarpal cloth set up in the front yard of their office in Palu, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is so bad.
Although aid teams began to provide disaster relief in a bleak atmosphere, some said foreign aid workers with deep experience were prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesia's regulations, funding, supply of essential materials and delivery of workers from abroad can only be carried out if disaster areas are declared national disaster zones.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross Force.
"When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster,' then we can receive help from abroad but for now there is no status."
When the second night was approaching in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the missing victims hoped that their loved ones would be a miracle that turned up and cheered them off.
On Saturday, a boy was found in the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman trapped under a rock for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's national skaters, has trained two of the skaters who were missing from the quake for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi said.
“As a senior in the field of skaters, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recounted how he had earnestly sent WhatsApp messages to the launchers in Palu who participated in the beach festival after hours of news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the launch community.
The message sent only has one gray-colored rat sign instead of two blue-colored rat sign.
"I don't think the message came," he said.
The thief stole <0x24>26,750 during an ATM recharge at Newport on the Levee.
The thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from Brink's employees who filled in money at Newport on the Levee ATMs on Friday, according to news released by the Newport Police Department.
The Brink worker emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and was ready to send more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink's employees were busy doing their jobs, a man 'runs to his back' and steals a bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene based on the report, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the thief should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rap singer Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing his name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "This man is officially known as Kanye West."
Kanye West, 41, called Ye for a while and she used the nickname as the title of her eighth album released in June.
The change came during his appearance on the Saturday Night Live show where he is expected to release his latest album Yandhi.
"She replaced singer Ariana Grande who cancelled her appearance on the show over 'emotional issues,'" the show's creator said.
Previously, Kanye West said the name had religious significance and was also an abbreviation for his current professional name.
“I believe ‘yes’ is a common word found in the Bible and it means ‘you,’” Kanye West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you. I am us. We are us.
It went from Kanye to Ye - a reflection of our goodness, our evil and our confusion and all.
The album is more than just a reflection of our own true image."
He is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Kanye West's former partner, JAY-Z, can also accept it without or with hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, has vowed not to use military action against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military action against civilians as the country nears its 50th anniversary of a bloody tragedy against students.
AMLO pledged at Plaza Tlatelolco on Saturday to "never use the military to curb Mexicans."
The military opened fire on civilians who staged a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968 that killed 300 civilians as leftist student movements began to take place across Latin America.
AMLO vows to support Mexico's young people by subsidizing those who are studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education opportunities attract young people to become involved in criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its artificial intelligence fund.
"The United States should double the amount of funding in the field of artificial intelligence as China becomes increasingly active in the field," said investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view came after the United States government made an announcement about artificial intelligence even though the United States itself as a whole lacked an official strategy of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year with the goal of becoming number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Considering the allocation of artificial intelligence studies is a good start as all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to have the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"Doubling down on funding can increase the chances of the next big achievement of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book 'AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order' was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO of Sinovation Ventures who has invested in one of China's leading companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated American Othello players who were ranked best while still studying at Carnegie Mellon University. Later, he became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognizes previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robot Challenge from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and wants to know when the next competition will be held so he can identify new talents.
"Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to win government aid," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes on academic leaders but corporates," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have appointed great talents from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think the green card should be offered automatically to PhD graduates in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China released the Future Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
“China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions. It is similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center aimed at gathering partners from industry and academia. The White House announced a line of Select Committees for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF invests more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. bill seeking to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented in recent months.
The people of Macedonia voted to change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people held a referendum on Sunday to determine a name change to the ‘Republic of North Macedonia’. A move that would resolve a dispute with Greece that had lasted for a decade in which Greece had prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia, insists that the name ‘Macedonia’ represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia’s participation in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on a proposed name change in June but the nationalist opposition said the change undermined the ethnic Macedonian identity of the majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the vote cast doubts whether the referendum would achieve the minimum 50 per cent vote required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was written: "Do you agree to join NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change include Prime Minister Zoran Zaev saying "Receiving the new name is a price worth paying to join the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union because that means our lives are safer," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
Although illegal, lawmakers said they would comply with the vote's decision to make it final.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The country's election commission said there were no reports of non-compliance with the rules as of 1 p.m.
However, voting attendance was 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary elections after 66 per cent of registered voters threw away ballot papers.
"I came to vote because of my children. Our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko cast ballot papers in Macedonia for the country's name change that will pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and placing seats in front of a tent set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to join it with pride and not in this way," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor people, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said the participation in NATO would provide sufficient investment to Macedonia where the unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
I believe a large majority will accept because more than 80 per cent of our population voted for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting the vote.
He said the ‘yes’ decision was ‘a confirmation of our future.’
A poll was published on Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Policy Studies which said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the poll - below the required amount.
Another poll, run by Macedonian TV Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70<0x25> of them said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, the number of voters who come must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure in the referendum will be considered the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton's entire line of defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent on as Brighton defenders at Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look very happy on his net in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the midfield at the start of the order.
He raced between three Brighton defences, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He turned down a defender before chasing a few more people on the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he turned to the left, looking for Sterling.
The England forward used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a single kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with his leg problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in the Brighton area during the match.
He made a beautiful pass through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling towards the away position.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the network before sliding out of bounds.
City against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group play at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff contention, there was little reason to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hopes to face the fort on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are depleted play implications for the Rockies, who hold one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least a special chance spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock out their first division champions.
"Even if we're just playing, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the rest of the team going to play at probably the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I want to fight it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly likely to allow Scherzer to make a throw in this situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, held a warm-up session on Thursday and will make his usual day of rest on Sunday.
The right-handed thrower from Washington was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 hits right in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
The president did not directly refer to the situation surrounding the High Court electing Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of the number of Republicans coming in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks to face the most important elections in our lives.
I don't compete but I'm very competitive and that's because I'm in all places fighting for a great candidate," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this radical group of bad Democrats, you see it's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means, you see cruelty, evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to fight to gain power and lose. What they want is power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to ‘reject and block.'
"And you've seen that for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry, evil and untrue."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee position Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who had received a strong boo from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you divulge the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I'm waiting for one - it's a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen"
Work is no longer a large church.
It's not acceptable for anyone to express their views.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to denounce me, it wasn't surprising.
I'm the latest in the AP line of Labour being told that we're not welcome - all because of our voicing views.
My parliamentary friend Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because she was anti-Jewish.
In my case, the censure movement has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interest of responsibility about economic policy, about national security, about Europe, which is ironically an issue that is almost the same as what Jeremy did not agree with the previous leader.
A meeting notice for the Labour party of Nottingham East on Friday said that "we want a meeting that is all-inclusive and productive."
During my nearly eight years as a local AP Labor, the GC meeting on Friday night really did cover all of that.
Sad as it is today, it is not the tone for many meetings and the promise of ‘better, softer' politics has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It is becoming more evident that differences of views are unacceptable in the Labour party and that every opinion will be judged whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as a former colleague, I think sharing almost the same political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take a position that I would not agree on - either over national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak outside - and no matter what I say - then it will be followed by a denunciation for abuse on social media, told not to vote, denounced the political center, told me to quit the Labour party.
And that's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm more fortunate than my co-workers because of the comments against me more politically.
I was impressed by the professional attitude and persistence of my colleagues who were showered with the swearing of sexist and racial slurs every day but never gave up.
One of the aspects of this era's political disillusionment is how the level of abuse has become accustomed.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour party foster cultural tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a broad church and with every ‘distrust' proposal or change in election rules, the party is getting narrower.
I received a lot of advice over the last two years urging me to keep quiet, not stand out too much and then I’ll ‘be good.’
But that’s not what I want to get into politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, raised by the neglect of the Thatcher government that left my entire grade class devastated, I have been trying to lead a better public service for those most in need - either as a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hide my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East is likely to be confused about my position and part of the conflict with the current leadership.
"To those who support Friday's motion, what I want to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it will jeopardize our households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the feeling of wasting time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voters, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise unelected intimidation or political correctness doesn't prevent me from acting in what I believe is in the interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unmatched Ayr climbs to the summit
Two slow attempts may have made the final result skewed, but no doubt Ayr deserved success in this exciting and entertaining Tennent Premiership match-up.
They are now at the top of the table, the only one who has never lost out of 10.
Finally, their superior defence, as much as they took chances, made the home team and coach Peter Murchie happy.
"We've been tested on our game so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they took a better chance than us."
Grant Anderson made a try in the 14th minute, a conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr ahead, but, a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, was issued for the match by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make the grid and Jason Baggot caught a non-converting attempt.
Climo led Ayr with a penalty, before, at half time, he scored a then solo conversion attempt to make it 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second time well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, a conversion by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long delay due to Ruaridh Knott's serious injury, which was brought out, and from the start, Ayr went straight ahead again through Stafford McDowall's attempt, a conversion by Climo.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose countered the extra players with a no-conversion attempt at Bruce Colvine, at the end of a time of intense pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card due to Climo's tackle without the ball, from the outside of the penalty line, MacPherson hit Ayr's forward.
Climo's conversion, as he did almost like a restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent away flanker Gregor Henry for the host team's fifth try.
Still Game stars are seen to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is set to move into the hospitality industry after he was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old acted as Jack Jarvis on the BBC's famous show, where he wrote and co-starred with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last on the show, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun sources gave the impression that Kiernan wanted to engage in a "growing restaurant business."
'The ocean belongs to us': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen passage to the Pacific
Marine guard at the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly the blue flag of the sea.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon was typified with the motto: 'The ocean is ours.
To get back is a responsibility."
Throughout mainland-surrounded Bolivia, the memory of losing the coast to Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century is still clear – as is a longing to explore the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope may be the highest in the century, as Bolivia is still awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course hope for a positive decision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will be in favour of Bolivia's claim - after centuries of discussion - Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president - who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year - is also of much interest in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a ruling in favor of Bolivia - and if it does happen a little will change very little.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to award the region to Chile, and has determined that it will not decide on a possible outcome of the talks.
On the ICJ's decision to come out just six months after the final argument was heard showed the case was "uncomplicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, Chile's international law expert.
And it’s not to slow down Bolivia’s policies any longer, for these four years there may be obstacles.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's rhetorical hostility has diminished Chile's little compassion, he suggests.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was usually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end a 139-year feud for the common good," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - used the maritime issue as a political aid.
"Bolivia has never given up on its right to get a direct passage to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we need to forget the past."
North Korea says a nuclear ceasefire won't happen unless it believes the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not commit to their nuclear disarmament in the first place if it did not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to want to restart nuclear diplomacy that stalled more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was "just a dream" that continued U.S. sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is careful to agree to a declaration without Pyongyang first making an important act of ceasefire.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about launching weapons that are seen as the only way to ensure its country's security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for preparations for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show introduces the latest design of a large headpiece on its way to the main street near you.
If you want to add to your hat collection or block out the sun completely, then there's no need to search far.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a variety of large-sized bizarre headpieces for their SS19 collection on the stage of a show that graced the set of styles on Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their dazzling designs to the stage of the show.
The outstanding design by Valentino is a great cap of water-yellow color decorated with thick artificial fur that is wide covering the model's head.
Other large-sized accessories include gem-decorated ceramics, smart hats and even pineapples - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks - and the perfect time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have been stitched on her lips and more resemble Hannibal Lecter than elegant fashion.
One design resembling scuba diving equipment is equipped with snorkels and goggles, while the other looks like a liquid ice cream cone.
And if you keep up with the big fashion reality - you're in luck.
An observer of the style predicts that a very large bonnet may be heading to the main road near you.
The large, warm hat of 'La Bomba', a two-foot-wide straw hat has been seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The king of the label behind the very impractical hat has been featured on social media sending another huge design to the stage of the show - a straw beach bag almost as big as the model covering the bathing suit he was wearing.
The orange rafia bag is on fire, decorated with rafia sides and coupled with white holders, which stands out in the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity style expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for the next summer - because designers have made a huge impact and it's hard to let the demand for large-sized accessories go."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by the Scottish Board of Private Schools (SCIS), strives to serve at the best level to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students to pursue higher education, their chosen career, and their place as global citizens.
As the education sector they can and implement the school's curriculum earlier, we see modern languages continue to be well-known and the subject of choice within the school.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it will go into his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it will come into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exam, we can see that language is the top subject in the league table with the highest passing rate in private schools.
68<0x25> of students who study a foreign language get a higher A grade.
This data, compiled from 74 SCIS school members, showed 72 percent of students got higher A grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them studied German, 69 percent of them learned French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also got A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Language now, as a subject of choice, is being held just as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that the reasons employers struggle to meet vacancies, 17 percent attributed to a lack of language skills.
Because of that again and again, language skills become a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring language, these skills are essential in this globalized world.
Regardless of a person's chosen career, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having life-long skills like these.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country will put someone who mastered many languages automatically in front of the competition.
According to YouGov's poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough for conversation, with French being the language of conversation used by only two-digit percentages, 15 percent.
This is the reason why investing in language education is so important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially countries developing their economies, will equip children with better opportunities in finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will be different in the language they learn.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are seen as very important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there are always plenty of languages to choose from within a private school, with an instructor who specializes in that area.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing an atmosphere of learning that will prepare children and provide them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future holds.
There is no denying at this time, in a global business environment, that language continues to be very important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern language should be considered an ‘international communication skill.’
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron will make the Lakers' first appearance on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game before the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he's going to play hasn't been determined yet.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James might be playing in a limited minute.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule before the Lakers' season.
"I don't need a game before the season to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a hasty rally campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote being held for him to fill a vacancy in the Federal Court, Trump is aiming to win support for the next midterm election as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
The Trump rally at Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's trial of Federal Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over sexual misconduct charges with confirmation of a Senate vote expected to be held for a week during an FBI investigation.
But the primary target of this hasty rally is to help Republicans gain momentum in the face of the November election.
So, President Trump's campaign said five rallies in the coming week were to "strengthen volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress's control is so critical to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible in our busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring in supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won more than 40 percent of points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is following him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to support him," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. troops show courage to fight to ensure hope is still there heading into singles matches on Sunday
After three one-sided games, Saturday's round-robin game is probably what the Ryder Cup needs this time around.
The swinging momentum is a sports concept that is a creation but it is really believed by players, and even more so in a match like this.
Where's the momentum right now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now it's four points, so we brought a bit of momentum, I think," said Jordan Spieth as he walked in at the end of the day.
Europe certainly has an advantage, four points ahead with twelve more points to grab.
American players, as Spieth put it, felt they had a bit of an edge and a sense of drive, not just from Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and had three of four points each.
Spieth showcases venomous games from the start to the green area and serves as an example to other players.
The rousing cheers grew louder as he continued to advance, taking a crucial swipe to match the four points when he and Thomas fell behind after two points.
His streak that gave them the victory on the 15th hole was met with the same cheer, which tells you that he believes the American team is still fighting.
"You just have to work harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all there is for all these players now.
18 holes to show power.
The only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable Ryder Cup.
The pair of players are different from the Europeans, but they like four points out of four and don't seem to make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to do bogi on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogi on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That period and the way their energy is given and shown by supporters is proof they are a player to beat on Sunday, and there are no more popular players to block the possibility of a European victory during the sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best to have them both in different places.
However, the conversation about the European team's victory was too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson facilitated the work of Sergio Garcia, a four-player hero this morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogi and two doubles in the first nine holes made it difficult for the Spaniard and the Swede.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch more closely because of the interaction between the pair, the advice given and not given and the strategy that can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe played better as a team so far and went ahead on the final day but the four sessions also showed the U.S. team had the courage that was previously doubted by many, including local fans.
European teams lead 10-6 heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe brought a comfortable advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after rising from a four-ball and four-player game with a 10-6 point lead over the United States.
Both greats, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead with two wins over Tiger Woods who were struggling to take their victory at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn sought to retain the trophy seized at Hazeltine two years ago, taking control of the errant American team in the morning four-ball session, with a 3-1 points draw.
The U.S. team gave more competition in a four-player game, winning two games, but couldn't bridge the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 points from 12 in Sunday's singles match to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European player to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four of their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then together defeated Woods and new American Bryson Dechambeau in a 5<0x26>4 match.
Woods, who went through two tough games on Saturday, has shown his brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 four-ball and four-player games and in seven straight matches.
Justin Rose, who did not play during the morning four-ball session, again teamed up with Henrik Stenson in a four-player match to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2<0x26>1 - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe is unlucky on a quiet and relaxed day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time major championship winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became the measuring sticks for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They secured a 2<0x26>1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball match and then again defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4<0x26>3 match in a four-player game that was lost in the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have a team trailed four points to a singles match, although as defending champions Furyk's team only needed a tie to retain the trophy.
After taking second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looked like it was beyond their reach.
North Korea says it's "impossible" that it will voluntarily disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions have led to their deep distrust of the United States and it is unlikely that his country will give up nuclear weapons voluntarily in the situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, closing nuclear test sites and pledging not to expand the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any trust in the United States, there would be no confidence in the security of our country and under such circumstances, it would be impossible for us to disarm illegally first."
While Ri rebuked the complaint against North Korea over Washington's opposition to Washington's "staged" nuclear deterrence approach in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking unilateral steps, the statement appeared to be important because it did not reject voluntary repudiation as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the president of the United States and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for a "nuclear shutdown of the Korean peninsula" while Trump gave assurances to North Korea's security.
North Korea is trying to find an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to follow the recommendations to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on a "first termination" and increases the level of pressure in the sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and even opposes the "final declaration of war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can weaken us is the empty dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is the ongoing restrictions that are worsening our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by the US leader during a United Nations conference earlier this week.
The minister only mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the parties to this issue were South Korea and not the U.S., the nuclear shutdown from the Korean peninsula would not have found a standoff."
However, Ri's tone of speech differed dramatically from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with a North Korean rocket was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump named Kim as a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations conference, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work remains to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea ends its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue diligently and without fail until we feel the complete, final and confirmed nuclear end."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea in the hours after it had condemned him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to reveal missile sites as well as nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "same measures" that Kim sought were the assurances of security that Trump had promised in Singapore and were heading towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken courses to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all of its students more sleep in an effort to combat the ever-growing culture of learning through a caffeine-based 'overnight'.
An instructor finds students at the world's number one university often can't understand the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, provides a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He gained inspiration to start the course after giving lectures on the effects of sleep deprivation during learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only being told about this now, in my senior year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - and that surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
This course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students the need for good sleep habits to help academic and sporting achievement, as well as improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding its students had been sleep-deprived throughout the week.
The one-hour course involves several interactive assignments.
In one section, there is an image of a dormitory room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep routines.
In the other section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Campus maps with interactive icons, then encourage participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it's not going to change the behavior of the students right away.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects when choosing to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
A culture of pride in ‘staying up all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing stress on students means sleep deprivation is an increasingly tapering problem.
Making sure you have enough quality sleep, it should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says - even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, making it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler plan the course, having taken his class last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to develop the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same learning program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler suggests that students should consider the use of alarm clocks before and even after sleep, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can damage your circadian rhythm from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals beat Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another defeat at home when Dolly Menga's side tied Steven Gerrard's weak side with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were still looking for their first home victory since February 4-1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager to put his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership's predecessor, Hearts.
Mega exploded in the seventh minute before the first half and the Rangers seemed to have no idea of an equaliser.
With the Rangers now down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and was just behind Hibernian with a goal difference.
And the Rangers may face further problems after the lineman, Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after being thrown an object from his team's area.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team that reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup after beating Ayr.
Holt keeps the same Livi 11 team that stole one point from Hearts last week and he's certainly happy with the way his team play that worries their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated the game but Livingston made more attempts on goal.
They should have scored just two minutes after Menga's first touch gave Scott Pittman space through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed.
A free kick from Keaghan Jacobs' back found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only send the ball behind the goal.
The Rangers managed to regain control but it remained only hope in the last thirty minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a penalty kick in the forty-fifth minute when he and Steven Lawless clashed but referee Steven Thomson allowed the Colombian to appeal.
The Rangers only managed to score two tries in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily fended off Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's weak kick.
While Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be against the pace of the game, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers once again failed to deal with Jacobs' planned move.
Scott Arfield was only stiff when Declan Gallagher tossed the ball to Scott Robinson who calmly sent it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard made the switch during break time by converting Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and it almost made an immediate impact when the winger gave the ball to Morelos but an impressive Kelly came out of his area to block.
But Livingston continued to make it difficult for the opposing side to play the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sending long passes for long passes.
Holt's side were supposed to have widened the gap in the final stages but McGregor held on well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow's stretcher missed the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton appealed for another penalty kick when he collided with Jacobs but again Thomson ignored it.
Almanac: The creator of the Geiger Count
And now, page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and LOOK... the day on which future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device known as PengeraGeiger.
As a major science base since then, Counter Geiger has become the backbone of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring unknown scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger count, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you use these earphones, you can actually hear the effect of the atoms given by the radioactivity in the mineral."
Yes, it sounds like it now!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the creation that bears his name endures forever.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify bad cells as part of treatment
The method involved is to extract immune cells from the patient, transforming them in the laboratory.
It can 'see' proteins that are common to many cancer cells and then re-inject
The experimental vaccine showed promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman is being treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, recovering from her ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, converting them in the laboratory so that they can "see" proteins that are prevalent to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our test results show that we have a very good vaccine.”
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
The same approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them ways to target cancer cells has been successful in treating this type of leukemia.
Kanye West Joins Pro-Trump Talks, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After His SNL Appearance.
It's not well received.
Kanye West was teased in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a spectacular performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would contest in 2020.
After performing his third song that night titled Ghost Town in which he wore the hat ‘Make America Great’, he continued to oppose the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I asked white people and they said, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'
You see, if I'm worried about racism, I've moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star later confessed to Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee about allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not released, Kanye West's footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
I'm not sure if Rock is trying to make fun of West with the post.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he has been having difficulties behind the scenes about his hat.
"They put me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They were bullying me!
Then they said, ‘I’m in an unimportant place,’” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "You want to see that insignificant position?" by saying that he's going to "wear my Superman coat, because that means you can't lead me.
Try the love."
His comments drew ridicule at least twice from the audience and the SNL cast looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one there telling the publication: "The whole studio went quiet."
West was brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, where her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed as Bottle Perrier.
West had the support of TPUSA's conservative leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest men: THANK YOU FOR WHY YOU WONDER THE CRITICS."
But a tweet from talk show host Karen Hunter said West was just "being himself and that's great."
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) who I believe accepts and shares an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
"We too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now known as "the man who used to be known as Kanye West."
He wasn't the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, rapper Snoop Dogg, had changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course his song refers to the legendary music, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later as an artist formerly known as Prince.
He was charged with attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington criticized toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword hero character as Jon Snow in HBO's medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has voiced the stereotype of the maco hero, saying his character played on screen means young people often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something was wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Games of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she felt "very strong" about dealing with the problem.
"I think it's quite strong in person, at the moment - where is our fault with masculinity?," he said.
"What did we teach people as they grew up, in terms of the problems we see now?"
Kit believes television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He added: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is being taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel like they have to be this guy?
I think that's one of the most important questions right now - how do we change it?
There's something wrong with today's youth."
In the interview, he also admitted he will not play any preludes or follow-up to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he's "done with a battlefield and horses."
In November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's remake True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a pirate.
The actor recently revealed he considers a meeting with his wife, Rose, to be the best thing to happen at Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so that way, it gave me a family of the future and my life started from here," he said.
Rose played the character of Ygritte, Jon Snow's love interest played by Kit, in the Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14<0x25> increase in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are transmitted through sex, signaling a change from the previous one.
HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people living with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year, the number of HIV/AIDS cases in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be increasingly prevalent.
Because of the country's conservative value, studies estimate that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of the disease is due to insufficient sexual protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaked GOP senator data, criticized 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegations of a staff member who posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserted the claim had been spread by members of the "ultra-right wing" and websites.
“Frauds, scams and more scams are severe,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information spread reportedly included the home address and phone number for U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, broadcast by strangers on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported IP addresses identifying the cause of the posts associated with Waters' office and disseminating information of Waters' staff members, Hill said.
"These baseless allegations are false and a lie," Waters said.
"My staff - whose identity, personal information, and security have been compromised due to these false allegations - have absolutely nothing to do with this information leak.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and form of fraud."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is infuriating," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows that he has no right to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they don't do, they can't get angry.
They can't fight.
They can't question the motives of the defendants.
They have to be calm."
Fleischer said while comparing Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican running to beat Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great news if it's true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said its office had informed "the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," he said, "and they will be responsible for all their actions which could be devastating and dangerous to any and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - Rowan Atkinson's weak intelligence scam
It is common now to find signs of Brexit in any new film with a British slang and it seems to apply to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy fraud franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a joke about how bad it is for us to become a new exporter of the country?
In any case, the eye-catching and bored-faced Johnny English has a chance to ruin the situation for the second time - the name of the signal that is more than everything that he is a widespread comic creation designed for the territory of non-English moviegoers.
He is, of course, a dumb secret agent with a strange character to relax the glamour of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a musician who contributed a note to the theme song Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony.
He is also inspired by the mysterious international traveller and spy agent Rowan Atkinson, who once appeared in a now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, leaving the chaos behind.
There's one or two great moments in JE's latest film.
I love Johnny English approaching the helicopter while dressed in medieval armor and a fan blade attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is being shown, but his sense of humor is very weak and strange, especially "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offer comedy as their material.
The joke felt as if it was highlighted for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's accidental mistake was not innovating and focused on Atkinson's films in Bean's persona.
The main premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's secret web network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground and disappointing the agent on duty - a very minor character for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a proud and snobbish prime minister who is struggling with political collapse and unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with Teresa May's side character but there's nothing good in the script for her character.
His intelligence advisor tells him every active spy has been compromised, and he needs to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is clumsy and now works as a school teacher in some fancy places, but gives an unsuitable lesson to be a secret agent: some good jokes here, because English offers spying knowledge at an academy like the School of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, engaged to a submarine commander, a fiery character brought in by the rather destructive Vicki Pepperdine.
So, Batman and Robin, who excel in the Secret Service of His Majesty's Underworld, are back in action against Olga Kurylenko's beautiful seductive female character Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being affected with charismatic tech millionaires claiming he can solve Britain’s computer problem: the evil Jason Volta and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their adventures with small tasks: posing as waiters, lighting fires and burning French restaurants; frantically smuggles into Volta's luxury cruise ship; and English wreaks havoc as he tries to use Maya Reality headphones to get himself used to inside Volta's house.
All the funny scenes were brought in well for the final scene, but because it looked so friendly and boisterous there was a bit of a sense like a children's television show about it.
It's a pretty simple movie.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I kept thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that does fit his talent?
The Labour Party of Nafi plans for Britons to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week - but paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to channel savings made through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to employees by giving them an extra day of leave.
It will see staff enjoying the weekend for three days - but still bring home the same salary.
Sources said the idea "fits" with the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country in favor of the workers.
The move to work for four days a week was supported by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "Policy studies are expected to be announced before the end of this year.
"It won't happen overnight but working four days a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to balance the economy and favor workers as well as the overall industry strategy of the party."
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party pledging a four-day work week in an election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not the party's policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labor conference last week by advancing his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power away from "faceless directors" and "coachers" at utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that current shareholders in a water company may not be able to recoup their entire shares because the Labor government may make a "cut" on the grounds that they are deemed to have committed an offence.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the company's board of directors and set up an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 percent of private sector firms' equity to employees, which will receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to give their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seems to be more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you to attend the trial, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, whose accusation appeared, and said, 'Did you do it?'
He's strong, clear, and clear."
Graham's decision has been finalized.
"I have already made a decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh and he will take the charges seriously," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know about this: Brett persistently denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he's named can't confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
You don't see any change."
Is the World People’s Party and Has the Event Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World People's Party, an annual music event that features an impressive array of great stars and equally great missions; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World People's Party will see tens of thousands of people gather at Central Park's Main Page to not only watch shows like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Party, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international support group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors to the concert need to complete some tasks, or "actions" such as being a volunteer, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls or any other meaningful means to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how far will the rest of the world go in the next 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a sincere way to persuade people to take action, or is it just another case of clicktivism - making someone feel like they've done something by simply signing a petition online or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said it has recorded 19 million "acts" from its supporters, who are pushing for a different set of goals.
They say these actions have helped push world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than <0x24>37 billion that will bring change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, and at least <0x24>10 billion of them had already been misappropriated or collected.
The group also estimated that the identified funds had an impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key committees include the Nutrition Power, a partnership between UK-based investors and skippers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", promising to contribute <0x24>35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate the country's unbalanced diet after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Gobal Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, the federal government and Global Citizens like yourself, we can turn this unbalanced nutritional social injustice into a historic past," said Tracey Ullman, the nutrition authority's ambassador at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said after receiving more than 5,000 calls for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government had called for funding a project, Nutrition Power, which will now reach 5 million women and children who need it.
Responding to one of the Frequently Asked Questions on his website asking "what makes you think we can end hardcore poverty?"
Global Citizen has responded: "This is a difficult path and it will take time - there are times when we will be disappointed and disappointed.
But, just as the movement demanded civil rights and antiapartheid before, we will succeed, because when we work together we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among several artists who have also performed at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy as "restrictions" to prevent Russia from exporting oil
Washington can "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russia from selling its oil in markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said in a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - as it is known, involved themselves at the invitation of the Syrian government - purportedly in search of a new oil market.
"I believe their presence in the Middle Tmur is to dominate the oil supply as they have done in eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there is a way to address this issue.
"The United States has the capability, with our Navy, to keep sea lanes open, and if necessary, to prevent their oil from being marketable," he said.
Zinke said that during a speech at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of oil consumers" in the US.
He also compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, stressing the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is more or less the same, influencing and replacing oil," he said, while referring to Russia as having no other option and with its economy so dependent on oil.
This statement was issued during the Trump administration's mission to increase exports of liquid natural gas to Europe which is much cheaper to consumers in Europe, replacing Russia.
Trump officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "heavy-sided" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said would make Berlin backed by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project will assume the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters and it is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denies that Washington is so strongly opposed to the project is for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I am convinced that we agree that energy cannot be used as a weapon to suppress and that consumers must be free to choose," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This action by the U.S. has prompted the dissatisfaction of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industrial organization, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has asked that the US not interfere in the EU's energy policy as well as on the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our country's energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI) after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladmir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Think Cooking" to Run for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think thoroughly" before becoming a presidential candidate following a midterm election.
During an open question with residents in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider contesting.
"It's time for a woman to head to Washington and fix our divided government and this includes putting a woman on top of it," she said.
"After November 6th, I'm going to think about the timing to be the presidential candidate."
Warren expressed his concern for President Donald Trump during an open question, saying that Trump "is driving our country in the wrong direction.
"I'm concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren strongly criticized Trump for nominating Brett Kavanaugh as a Federal Court candidate.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "we definitely need an FBI investigation before a vote is made."
However, a salute to a survey on Thursday, showed the majority of the population in the area represented by Warren felt Warren should not be contesting in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not contest, according to a survey by the Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Studies.
Thirty-two percent supported him.
The poll also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to contest, with 38 percent supporting him with the potential to contest and 48 percent disagreeing.
The names of other high-profile Democrats also discussed as potential to contest in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin reveals post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) track at Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is facing, after coming home, I can feel the feelings of other families who are facing this PTSD problem and those who are coming home with injuries," he said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said the events of his son's detention were "significant" and he said of his son and other veterans of the war as, "they came home different, quite hard and wondered if they would be praised for their sacrifices to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, disrupting reports of domestic violence and possessing weapons while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, Washington supports opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia voted in favor of a U.S. policy that prevents asylum for victims fleeing group attacks or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts registered friends with the court on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposed the policy, NBC news reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case Grace v. The suit session created by the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner and "his son's violent group members" had abused him but U.S. officials had rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He's under arrest in Texas.
State prosecutors in favor of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have the most number of people applying for asylum in the U.S., as a country filled with problems of evil groups and domestic violence.
The new policy of the US asylum application returns a decision made in 2014 in which the Immigrant Appeal Board has allowed migrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Secretary of State Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "disregards the state, federal and international laws that have existed for decades."
"Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances leading to the application, and preventing it would violate that principle," said a friend's statement to the court.
Prosecutors have also disputed the policy, which prevents entry of immigrants from hurting the U.S. economy, saying it is likely that these migrants will become entrepreneurs and "become the necessary workforce."
Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and violent gang violence in June.
Asylums will be granted to those who leave their homeland for fear of persecution because of racism, religion, citizenship or for belonging to certain social groups or holding to different politics," Sessions said in announcing the policy on June 11.
Asylums are not meant to solve all problems -- even if they are serious -- that everyone in the world faces every day.
Rescue work gets more frequent in Palu while death toll doubles
For those who survived, the situation became more critical.
"It's very stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was feeding her fever-stricken baby boy in the flooded Palu city centre.
"Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
There's very little drinking water."
Residents seemed to be slowly returning to their homes, searching for their belongings in the water while trying to save what could be.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, was resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to the aftershock.
Tears flowed as he scanned back as the earthquake rocked the five-storey hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There's nothing to save us.
I'm stuck on a collapsed wall, it feels like," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife's voice calling for help, and then she kept quiet.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and kids.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. paper detailing the common good of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused China of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid advertisement in the China Daily newspaper's Des Moines Register - the most-sold newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing the Chinese state of trying to interfere in congressional elections on Nov. 6, an allegation China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election explains what U.S. officials have reported to Reuters as a new phase in the campaign to pressure China.
A common practice for foreign governments to post ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now reeling in an increasingly bad trade war with each imposing tariffs on their imports.
China's initial action in this trade war was to target exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. state experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijng's move had hurt many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a press release in the Des Moines Register on Sunday wrote, "is now more bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In broadcasting this propaganda, the Chinese government accepted the freedom practiced by the Americans, a tradition that prioritizes freedom of speech and freedom of the press," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the Beijing press, there is very little opposition and you can't see the public's real view of China's worrisome economic direction because their media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the major newspapers in China avoided an offer to publish" of his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans set aside women's voters ahead of midterm elections for Kavanaugh's story, warns analysts
While many prominent Republicans support and favor Brett Kavanaugh, a Federal Court candidate facing sexual harassment charges, analysts warn they will call for a particularly strong response from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
High emotion enveloped this story and most Republicans stated in their records that they would continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be changed," Grant Reeher, professor of political science from the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher is unsure of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) move to force the FBI to start an investigation is enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget it tomorrow and in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during a rally in the Senate building hall as the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee voted to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic fervor and motivation will explode," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's too high; it's true.
This is likely to be higher especially for female voters who will vote from suburban areas and young voters, 18-29 years old, they don't like the president and rarely vote.
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault against him by a Federal Court candidate, analysts had speculated that there would be a disagreement if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
"This has been a very complicated thing for the GOP," Micheal Steela, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC news.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh succeeds as a federal judge, it's also about the way Republicans deal with this issue and the way they treat him," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helped elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided into two and don't know who to trust in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony with more than half in favor of Ford.
YouGov's latest survey showed 41 percent said they would believe or perhaps believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believe or may believe Kavanaugh
Meanwhile, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may not be cheating in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI is now investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other charge, reports Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian newspaper.
Last week Ford made a sworn confession before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh abused him in a drunken stupor when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez also said the Federal Court candidate also showed his genitals in front of Ford during a party while he was studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Website Creators Plan to Start a New Internet Network to Oppose Google and Facebook
World Website Creator Tim Berners-Lee launched a startup to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that uses open source software based on Berners-Lee's Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be entitled to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's real purpose was "to rule the world."
"We need to do this now," he said of the startup company.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, daily work lists, calendars, playlists and other personal professional equipment.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify which are available in one browser and simultaneously.
What's unique about the data storage in this private tablan is that it's up to the user for who can access the required type of information.
The company calls it "personal mastery over data."
The secret to this Inrupt, according to its CEO John Bruce, is to bring in certain resources, processes and expertise to help people enjoy Solid.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a number of developer staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create their own independent apps without focusing on any location using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee also said he and his team did not have any discussions with "Facebook and Google to introduce or not introduce a change where all their business models will change immediately.
"We're not asking for their truth."
In an issue in Medium on Saturday, Bernes-Lee wrote, Inrupt, "its mission is to provide a business and ecosystem energy to help protect the integrity and quality of new websites built using Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the world of the Internet when he founded the World Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been debating the need for websites to be independent.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Web Site Consortium, Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic for the new era of the website,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: First World War Victoria Cross Recipient Priest Celebrated
The only priest from the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross award during the First World War as a combat soldier was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Priest Benard Vann received this award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an ambush shooter four days later and did not immediately learn he had ever known that he had been awarded the highest award of the British army.
A memorial stone was erected and unveiled by two of his grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "a glorious symbol" as the stone would open its doors even 100 years after his grandfather's daring act.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann took his battalion across the de Saint-Quentin Canal "which was filled with thick fog and underwent a great assault by machine-guns."
He then rushed to the border with "extraordinary courage" and led it before firing a lone gun and shooting three people.
Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – a month before the war was over.
Micheal Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I couldn't possibly repeat and was so moving."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a flower necklace after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Show.
Micheal Vann said "it is a great honor to be part of this march" and added "true courage with the support that so many people have given."
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, instead they were given Peppa Pig
Imagine, you're awake all night to watch Bellator 206 but are let down from watching the main show.
The list from San Jose contains 13 matches, including six main matches that will be shown live each night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig's show.
Some of them were angry because they stayed up all night to watch the match.
One fan said the exchange to the children's cartoon channel was "an unnerving joke" through his tweets.
"Government regulations show that broadcasts at 6 a.m. are not suitable for matches so they are forced to broadcast broadcasts for children," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the Khinzir," yes.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they were working to reschedule the broadcast so that viewers in the UK could watch it.
"I think, when I talk about re-releases, I think we can do something," Coker said.
“But at six in the morning on Sunday there is no way we can do anything until Sunday is our time, which is Monday their time.
We're working on it.
Trust me, there's a lot of re-posting going on and it's not all good to hear.
We're trying to solve this problem, we think it's a technical problem.
But no, it's more of a matter of government.
I promise that this will never happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six - as always - and we're trying to do something that's not possible for the fans.
It's a poor situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's sense of "low self" toward sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old didn't realize anything until he was in high school and felt "not everyone is like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she talked about the gay right to give "hope" to those around her.
He also spoke after his father's title, he was not so concerned about winning in the Olympic games.
A regular presenter on this long-running show, Kris Young is on vacation for several months due to illness.
On her sudden appearance in Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt "less than" her peers as she grew up because "she wasn't socially accepted as a man or a woman."
He said: "To this day, feeling less than others and feeling different from others are the things that have driven me and given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a high-profile campaigner for the LBGT and has used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to stop more countries from making homosexuality a crime.
He said he spoke this way because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any problems and wanted to give "hope" to others like him.
The three-time world champion said the incident of falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - was "unprecedented."
Daley married the Oscar winner who was 20 years older than himself last year but said their age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so much experience at such a young age" - he joined the first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone in this age bracket who went through the same challenge.
The couple became fathers in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said "all the perspectives" of his life had now changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's only about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"There's more to it than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son's name is after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with cancer in the brain.
Daley said his father didn't want to accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if their ticket to London 2012 had been bought - because he wanted to sit in front once.
"I don't have the heart to say 'you can't be there to sit in the front row'," he said.
"I was still holding my father's hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until my father stopped breathing and was legally dead until I realized that my father wouldn't live forever," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I realize that this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of my fans in my own country at the Olympics, there's nothing else I've noticed that can match this," he said.
It was also a source of inspiration for her first choice of songs - "Proud" by Heather Small - that resonated with her during her preparations for the Olympics and still made her romp.
Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is not ready for Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to be ready to make amends for the game's performance so it doesn't end with sadness.
Mickelson, who will play in this biennial event for a record 12 times, was rested by captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" games on Saturday.
Despite being the usual focus for the United States, the winner of these five major competitions spends time being a cheerleader and practicing in hopes of improving the quality of the game.
A man who can't hit the ball straight even at the top of his game, the 48-year-old is not the right choice for Le Golf National golf course, where the distance is very difficult for a goal-scoring shot.
And if the golf course alone makes it difficult, Mickelson in his ninth game on Sunday will clash with British Open winner Francesco Molinari who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If an American player, missing four points starting with 12 singles games, starts with a fierce streak, then Mickelson's game is certainly very important.
Furyk is so confident in his players, that's all he can say.
"He understood his role today, and patted me on the shoulder and put his hands on my shoulder and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"His confidence is very high.
He is well known and has contributed a lot to this team since then, and this week.
I can’t imagine he’ll play in two games.
I can imagine more than that, but that's the way it is and the way we think we should do it.
He wants to be like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most appearances in Sunday's Ryder Cup.
This may be the last time he will join the Ryder Cup which has never matched his personal record achievements.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost 20 times and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought a shot of spirit to his team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's joking, he's wearing people and it's fun when he's in the team room," he said.
"I think all the young players are having fun with him, this week, and it's a lot of fun to see him.
He's not just playing, he's more than that.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knew their leading position would soon be lost
The European team captain, Thomas Bjorn, knew from his experience that the far-forward position he had could have lost in the final day of the Ryder Cup and made things difficult.
The Danish first entered the 1997 competition at Valderrrama, where Seve Ballesteros drove as captain and led the American team by 5 points but was only able to win very narrowly with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself after the leading position at Valderrama; we also got the leading position at Brookline but we lost and at Valderram we won, but it was a thin win," Bjorn said after seeing Class 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to be ahead with 10-6 points at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and to everyone in that team that this game is not over yet.
We're fighting hard tomorrow.
Go out and play hard and don't make mistakes.
It's not over until the eyes are picked up and placed on the screen.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and we will focus on this goal.
"I've said I will focus on 12 players in our team, but we all have to be aware of who we are - they are the greatest players in the world.
So happy with his men's achievements on the golf course so hard, Bjorn added: "I couldn't have guessed.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow's individual achievements need to shine and that's something different to do.
It's great to be out there with friends and when things go well but when you're alone then your full capacity as a golfer will be tested.
This is the message that all players need to hear, give the best in you tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he needs to give his best in her as well."
Contrary to Bjorn's view, his opponent Jim Furyk would expect his players to play well as individual players compared to team events, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to score three points out of four.
Furyk himself once had experience on the last day where the position changed, when he was in the winning team at Brookline before losing by surprise when the European team performed the "Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 burned the spirit of the player on the last day.
"We have 12 more events tomorrow, but if you want to get started as quickly as you can at Brookline, as you can see in Medina.
When the momentum starts, it will put pressure on the event in the middle.
"We're going to line up our players according to a procedure that we feel is appropriate, we're going to try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of fighting back and clashing with Rory McIlroy in the main event, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter European players who are in the top spot of the first part.
"I made this rule because I think it will stick and cover everything," Bjorn said of the individual player's choice.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The German Navy was due to receive its newest frigate in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warship, but the ship will not be completed until next year due to system damage and rising costs, according to local media reports.
The commissioning of the battleship "Rhineland-Pfalz", the first ship under the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate brand, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, unfortunately the post-surrender problem struck the fate of this huge project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood to contain features such as high-power cannons, a wide range of flying and anticipatory equipment as well as a number of features such as reduced detection by radar, red lights and akaustic capabilities.
Another important feature is a longer maintenance period - this latest frigate must be capable of sailing for up to two years from its base.
However, the range of obstacles means that the advanced warship, which is said to be capable of highlighting German power overseas, will be outdated by the time the ship joins the Navy, according to Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 frigate made headlines last year, when German Navy officials refused to commission the battleship in and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipbuilding company in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to its builder after delivery.
Not much is known about why the ship was repatriated, but the German press called some damage "software and devices" making the battleship useless if it was sent for combat missions.
Damage to the software had to be taken seriously as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleship would be operated by only 120 sailors - half of which was needed to operate the old Bremen-class frigates.
There are also issues where the warship is too heavy and this will reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to make any improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" warship is believed to be twice as heavy as the warships of the same class used by the German military during World War II.
In addition to damage to the device, the overall price of the project - including training for sailors - is also an issue.
The project is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - an increase from its original price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion Euro.
The problems that plagued this latest frigate battleship showed how much it missed the German naval capabilities.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in parliament, admitted the navy was facing a shortage of movable warships.
The official also said the issue was getting worse, as the old warship that had been stopped did not get a replacement warship.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust settles the life of bats
The latest study, which is being conducted on an estate in the Scottish highlands, aims to explain why bats use the shape of the earth's surface to hunt for food.
It is hoped that this study will lead to the latest findings on the unique behaviour of mammals that are able to fly and can serve as a guide for conservation activities.
Studies by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow regular bats, and soprano pipistrelles as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at specific locations around the property to keep track of bat activity throughout the season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using mobile tracking devices.
The expert analyzes the sound of all the recordings will identify the frequency of each bat type and its species and the actions of these bats.
A habitat map and report will be produced to create a scaled-up image of the earth's surface regarding the behavior of bats.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor to the NTS, hopes the results of this study will show the areas of habitat that are most important to bats and how they are used by each species of bat.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management such as making pastures and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
Bats are threatened by building and construction work that disrupts bat sites and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lights are also a risk to bats similar to fly trap paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials as well as pet cat attacks.
Bats are not blind.
Because bats hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They used location-detection techniques to identify the position of insects and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is highly prized for bats.
They have ten well-trained experts who often conduct surveys, check for stoppages and sometimes save bats.
The organisation has also founded Scotland's first bat protection centre at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the place where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, said this estate is the most suitable place for bats.
"We've got a very good place to live," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of big trees and suitable habitat.
There’s a lot more we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to live and grow.
He stressed how important it is to carry out inspections before starting maintenance work in the property because there is a possibility that we could accidentally destroy a bat nest that would contain bats' cubs where this could kill 400 bats and bats, and possibly destroy the entire local bat population.
Bats are protected and it is a mistake to kill, molest or disturb or destroy the nesting place of bats.
Elisabeth Ferrell, officer for the Bat Conservation Trust encourages people to help.
“There’s still a lot to learn about bats and for many species we don’t know how their populations are growing.”
Ronaldo has denied allegations of rape while his lawyer prepares to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused her of raping him of being "fake news" and said anyone was trying to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was later said to have paid <0x24>375,000 to cover the victim's mouth according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news."
"It's not true.
What they said today was fake news," said the winner of the 5 Ballon d'Or awards to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
Usually.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, this is part of my work.
"I'm happy and everything is fine," he said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue De Spiegel over the allegation, which they call "an unsubstantiated and disturbing report of personal space," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek damages for "moral damages that directly affect his personality, which may have been one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a luxury room of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of trespassing on the woman, according to an investigation paper registered at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed after the incident the player knelt in front of him and said he was "99 per cent" a "good guy" and had only fallen for "one per cent."
The document confirmed Ronaldo confessed to having sex, but on the basis of liking.
Mayorga also claimed he lodged a police report and took pictures of the injuries he suffered while in hospital, but later agreed to settle them out of court because he was "fearful of the response" and worried about being "disgusted by the public."
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel her previous settlement because she is still traumatized by what has happened.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester at the time of this allegation, and this summer he moved to Italian football giant Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ for loss of car manufacturer
The UK "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, said Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He also added that this was a bit of a "sieve" as Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the European Union without a solution, it would stop production of its manufactured cars in Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
"We need a solution," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of this would result in border delivery problems if there was no solution for Brexit and this would result in job losses.
The factory in Burnaston - which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis cars - installed nearly 150,000 units last year, 90<0x25> of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my view if Britain leaves the European Union without a solution by the end of March, we will stop production of cars at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Several other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar and Land Rover, have also expressed concern that the UK will leave the European Union without a solution on how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said they would close their Mini car factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is about the risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without any solution.
Toyota's production of cars relies on an installation basis based on timely receipt of supplies without having to be stored with parts of the car brought to the factory every 37 minutes from the UK and the European Union for the car to be booked.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a solution on March 29, it is likely that there will be a turbulence at the border that industry players predict will be a delay and a shortage of spare parts.
Toyota is unlikely to be able to store more than a day's supply of inventories at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production will be halted.
Mr Clark said Finance Minister Theresa May's future plans for bilateral relations with the European Union "should be done with certainty to avoid any cross-border checks."
"We need a solution. We want a solution that will allow not only success for the moment but for us to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC on Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also these other manufacturers shows that we must continue this highly successful supply chain.
Toyota can't say how long its production will be halted, but in the long run warns of rising costs and reducing the factory's competitiveness and resulting job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the union responsible for the management of the union at the plant, said union members have started to fret: "According to my experience, lost jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and strong plan for the future of relations between us and the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
A crucial meeting between Donald Trump and deputy public prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be "rejected next week" as the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as a candidate for the federal court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the election, the relationship between Trump's aides and Russia's possible obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public prosecutor or not and further disrupting Mueller's freedom to proceed with the investigation has been Washington's warmest gossip.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein planned to use a secret recording device to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of replacing the president with a 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, despite reports that he would step down.
Instead it was announced a meeting on Thursday with Trump who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was "unwilling" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid him clashing with Kavanaugh's confession and Dr Christine Blassey Ford one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of molesting him, in front of the Senate's judicial committee, to which they both gave the confession.
On Friday, Trump directed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which has suspended a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date hasn't been set yet, maybe this week, I think it might be delayed a week further given some of the things that are going on in the federal court.
We'll see about it later and I'll keep you up to date with the news.
Sanders has not held a White House press conference since Sept. 10.
When the host, Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said he didn't hold many press conferences not because he didn't like TV reporters trying to find "attention" but he also said: "I don't agree because they want attention."
Then he said the relationship between the press and Trump would increase.
"The president has had the most question-and-answer sessions compared to the presidents before him," he said without giving any evidence.
The press conference will still be held, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States something directly, that's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen us do a lot over the last few weeks and this will replace a press conference when you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump frequently answers questions from the press when on his way out of the White House or when participating in open-ended question-and-answer sessions or during a press conference with a guest of honor.
Media conferences are very rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he sometimes makes independent and bizarre appearances in front of reporters gathered.
The health secretary wrote to EU employees at the NHS about their concerns over Brexit
The secretary of state has written a letter to all workers from the European Union working at NHS Scotland to express their gratitude for the country and hope they will continue to work here after Brexit.
MSP's Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish government has been committed to bear the costs for the application of residents of the European Union working in its public sector.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the withdrawal have continued, and are heading to reach a decision by the autumn.
But the UK government has stepped up preparations to face a scenario without a solution.
I know this is something that worries you very much.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate each one of you's contributions, regardless of your nationality.
Co-workers from across the European Union and other countries, bring together a wealth of experience and expertise that strengthens and improves health services and benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is where you all live and we want you all to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury after losing 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessean.
Head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before the second half.
"He approached the edge line and suddenly collapsed there," Reed said.
The coach and health officer gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting him in the gutter and taking him for further treatment.
An official from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type or extent of the injury at this time" and Tennessee State is trying to identify when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-year red shirt student, played in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He made five starts on Saturday before leaving the game, his number of goals this season was 18.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they purchase property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they purchase property in the UK and this extra money will be used to help vagrants under the latest Tory plan.
This move will undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
This stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is expected to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help vagrants
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - money from this will be used to help vagrants, Theresa May said today.
The move appears to confirm Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with the promise of providing affordable housing and making high-income people a target.
This stamp duty increase will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, money from these proceeds will help the government overcome the problem of homeless people.
This addition - in addition to the stamp duty that has already been imposed - includes the higher duties introduced two years ago on the second house and the house purchased for rent which may be charged 3 percent.
The Treasury is expected to be able to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year through this move.
An estimated 13 percent of new properties in London are purchased by non-UK citizens, causing prices to soar and making it difficult for those looking to buy their first home.
Most of the luxury areas - especially in the capital - have become "silent lonely" as many of their owners are foreigners who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johson demanded that stamp duty be reduced so that more young people could afford to buy their first home.
He accused a large construction company of deliberately maintaining high property prices by buying land but not developing it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate quotas on affordable housing to overcome Britain's "shameful housing problem."
Corbyn has announced a series of exciting housing reform proposals, including rent controls and the repeal of "innocent" evictions.
He also wanted more power to be given to the council members to build a new house.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term as prime minister to restore the British dream - this life must improve for every generation to come.
And that means improving our poor housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair as it is very easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad to buy a home compared to the hard-working British population here.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home is very far away, and the fact of living everywhere with a sense of humiliation is a reality.
Jack Ross: ‘My main goal is to manage Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa said his "primary goal" was to become Scotland's manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scottish is looking forward to a challenging opportunity to revive the third-placed North-East club in League One, three points short of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for the B cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportound.
"I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there was something that always drew me there.
It would only happen if I was a manager at the club level.
Ross's replacements as manager of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he did not feel the need to follow in the footsteps of the name so well-known in big clubs, as he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“For me, what I mean at the moment is, ‘Can I bring this club back into the Premier League?’
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it should be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to achieve, but I would consider myself a success if I could return the club to the Premier League."
Ross was only three years in management, having been assistant manager at Dumbarton and one of the coaches at Hearts' for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa return to level three after being relegated and changed the fate of St Mirren from being relegated to Champions the following season.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than when he was a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's a choice," he recalled, when managing Allaah.
"I know that I'm in a good position to play rather than play.
Maybe it's because I'm so lucky to be alive and have a good time.
Playing is a bit difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of pressure and pressure as a player but as a manager I'm more comfortable.
I’ve always wanted to take care of it and now I’m doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something I’ve liked throughout my adult life.”

The ideal time to drink beer is 5.30pm on Saturday, according to the study.
This summer's heat wave brought good luck to British pubs that were in trouble but the network's restaurants were under pressure.
The pubs and bars showed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but in restaurants it dropped 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consulting firm that compiled these figures, said: "The ongoing hot weather and the longer England World Cup campaign means that July will follow the pattern of June, where pubs are up 2.8 per cent, unless restaurants are down even more severely.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June worsened in July.
The performance of the pubs that prioritized drinks and bars was very strong compared to the declining restaurants.
Pubs that prioritize food also suffer bad luck due to hot weather, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It seems that most people just want to go out for a beer.
The pubs and bars recorded a 6.6<0x25> increase in sales for the month, while food dropped 3<0x25>.
Paul Newman, an entertainment and food analyst from RSM, said: "This decision appears to be the same and has been ongoing since the end of April.
Weather and social events or sporting events are still a major factor in the increase in sales in the outdoor market.
Unsurprisingly, the restaurant group continued to narrow, with sales down 4.8 per cent if the year-to-year comparison was likely to be worse with the cost pressure again.
The long hot summer weather overwhelms restaurant operators at severe times and only time will determine if cooler weather like ours in August will bring relief."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July showing a slowdown in newly introduced brands.
Observers for the sales sector at UK pubs, bars and restaurants The Coffer Peach Tracker collected and analyzed data performance from 47 operating groups with a turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion were industry benchmarks.

A study by the UK's Digital Awareness and Conference of Teachers (HCM) independent schools found 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with more than half of them admitting they keep a personal account.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It's disturbing to see so many teenagers stuck creating online spaces where parents and teachers can't keep track of them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice to athletes" in the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director during the governing body's general meeting.
Doyle is a well-known Scottish race athlete and chairman Ian Beattie said the move is an opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from Doyle's more than a decade of international experience.
"It is highly regarded in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from her participation in the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice to all athletes and I look forward to contributing and helping guide this sport in Scotland.
The American, who won gold medals for the 200-meter and 400-meter events at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, now holds four Olympic gold medals and now makes coverage for the BBC, after being unable to walk due to a transcient ischemic attack.
He said: "I had a stroke last month.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time can determine the extent to which I can recover.
It's not easy to be like the old days, I had to learn to walk again and today I had to do some intelligence training!
Thank you for all your support!"
Mother's milk pump ads that make comparisons with cows bring conflicting opinions online
A mother's milk pumping company got a variety of conflicting opinions online because their ad compared breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked for milk.
To launch what is said to be the world's first "silent, wearable breast milk pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous music video to show the freedom that can be felt by mothers using this new pump.
Four mothers danced in a straw-filled cow barn to a song in which the lyrics read: "Yes, I pump my own milk, but you can't see any tail" and "if you don't realize it's not nipples, it's my boobs."
"Pump out, pump out, I'm sucking the kids, pump out, pump out, I'm pumping my boobs out."
However, this ad published on the firm's Facebook page has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, the video has attracted mixed reactions from the general public, many saying it provides a cheery picture of the "horrifying" dairy industry.
"It was an unnatural decision to use a cow to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows need bunting and need to give birth to babies to produce milk, but unfortunately the calf is divorced from the cow's mother within a few days of their birth," said one author.

Another commented: "It's definitely a trauma to cows and calves.
"But why don't you use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another added: "An ad that has nothing to do with it directly."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "really ridiculous."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy one if I still give milk.
It makes me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I see it as it is.
It's a genius product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at pumping moms (often at work or on the toilet) and feeling like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that compliments or assesses the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they have all been dancing with hidden pumps in their underwear.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the perception that most women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, Pam Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be loaded hidden in the shirt in the milking, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Pam Elvie is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By equating pumping women with dairy cows, we want to put breastfeeding and all the challenges associated with it as the main focus, while showing an entertaining and connected way to feel free through the use of new pumps.
This isn't the first time Ellie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared on the stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Children's Migrants Move Silently to Camp Camp on the Texas Border
The number of migrants detained is increasing even though the monthly border transfer has not changed much, due to the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, making placement of children with underagers increasingly difficult.
According to tradition, guarantors are undocumented immigrants, and they fear affecting their position to stay in the country if they take a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective underwriters and other adults in the family would have to submit their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, testified before Congress that the agency had detained dozens of individuals who had applied to be guarantors to unsupervised children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those detained had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 per cent of the individuals who are either guarantors or family members of guarantors, are here illegally and most of them are illegal immigrants.
With that, we will continue to hunt down the individual," Albence said.
In order to process children more quickly, authorities introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest, not after 60 days according to the previous standard, according to protection workers.
Many will attend via video conference calls, rather than in person, to appeal their case for a valid position in front of an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer the child is in custody, they will be more likely to become anxious or depressed, and this will lead to acts of anger or attempts to escape, according to protection officials and according to reports released by the system in recent months.
Proponents say the concern is higher in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where a sign that children are struggling with feelings may not be detected, due to the size of the place.
They add that by moving children to the camp town without setting up time for them to be emotionally prepared, or saying goodbye to friends may exacerbate the trauma they face.
The U.S., French and Turkish forces immediately withdrew.
Speaking at the United Nations General Conference, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return, despite the country's eighth year of war.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops on Syrian soil under a terror-fighting scheme "will be subjected to appropriate action."
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the conference.
Moualem stressed that the "war on violence has ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy war until we eliminate Syria" from both violent groups and "any foreign occupation".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, specially for training and advising the Kurdish and Arab forces of Syria against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were appropriate for them to return, and he accused "some foreign countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with this return," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomat said an agreement between Russia and Turkey to provide a military-free zone in rebel-held areas of Idlib had created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
Russia-Turkey talks have diverted major attacks by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the territory where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has a "real time limit" and hoped military action would target jihadists including rebels from the Nusra Front linked to Al Qaeda, who "will be wiped out."
UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to organise the first meeting of the new committee, which contains the government and opposition members to draft post-war expansion and pave the way for elections.
Moualem stated the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "checking the articles of the current constitution," and warning against interference.
Trump will win a second term.
With that logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless, as liberal observers expect, the impeachment and scandal charges end his presidency prematurely.
In an undisputed situation as "the most dramatic finale of a presidential post!"
At the moment, there are no signs of wear.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average prime time audience of 2.4 million, an additional from 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" broadcast had topped the cable ratings, up to 3.5 million viewers on prime news nights.
"This is a fire that grabs people's attention because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, lead producer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," a story about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He recalled a taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the confusion.

Money is flowing into the middle of the electoral process.
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th election saw a cash flood, as the re-election of congressional districts saw two incumbents now contesting for the same seat.
The redrawn suburban Pittsburg district contests Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in a special election the previous spring.
Lamb is competing against another incumbent, Republican Representative Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of old Pennyslvania, which overlaps with the 17th.
The map was redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district had been guerrymandered in favor of Republicans.
The new 17th inning has started a fierce financial campaign competition between the main party finance machinery of the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a commonly heard name in Pennsylvania after a slim victory in the March special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennyslvania that was watched by many.
The seat was won by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politically intelligent people have given the Democrats an advantage.
U.S. Plans to Fine El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Withdraws
The diplomats of the Dominican Republic and Panama have acknowledged Beijing, with little negative response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners ousted the Trump Organization's management team.
Government Department officials decided to call back the heads of American diplomatic representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decision not to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were only imposed on El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in American aid in 2017, including narcotics control and economic support.
The proposed fines, including cuts to financial aid and restrictions on the intended visa, would have a negative impact on the Central American nation with high rates of unemployment and murder.
After the internal meeting, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, in the wake of a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in preventing migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials decided that they wanted the conference to continue, effectively stopping any considerations to fine El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now give a speech at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the administration's place of import at the meeting, according to diplomats.
And all three American representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no firm message or fines from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on condition of anonymity.
Their descriptions are supported by outside analysts who are close to the administration and also speak on terms of anonymity.
Historical Studies
What will happen next may be Robert Mueller's special counsel's report of a possible obstruction of justice by Trump, for which there is now solid evidence in the public record.
Mueller will also lead an investigation into whether Trump's campaign has joined Russia in an attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability on the side, as soon as he is ready to face voters, and possibly finally a jury containing his counterpart.
It's all if, and I'm not saying that Trump's downfall is bound to happen - or someone like him in Europe.
There are choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on how long this struggle will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make an attempt for a coup against Hitler, if the West did not follow Hitler and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We've failed, and we've missed the opportunity to avoid the brutal murders that took place in the next few years.
The course of history revolves around such a point of inflection, and the unimpeded course of democracy will be accelerated or suspended.
The American people are facing some of these inflection points now.
What would we do if Trump fired Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversees Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this paper made a report that, last year, he had intended to make a record of the president and speculate that the president was not eligible for the post.
Rosenstein said the Times' statement was inaccurate.
"How will we act if the FBI's new request for investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the apparent allegations of sexual assault and evidence of fraud?
And what's more, are we going to vote for the congressional term squabbling over which Trump will be held accountable?
If we fail the test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was of Czechoslovak Jewish descent who had been expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had conquered my embassy home.
He survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, learning that a win against Austria, following a draw with Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his senior debut this season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers are using this result as a stepping stone to a great victory.
"It's a good point because Villarreal are a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We played in this game with the belief that we will get something and we have got one point.
We may have won at the end of the match, but the draw may have been a fairer result.
They probably played better in the first half and we played better in the second half and in the better side.
On Thursday, another great European night.
We hoped we would get three points but the game was difficult because they had a good result in the previous game but, the crowd supported us, I'm sure we will play well and get a positive result.
"Last year was difficult, between everything that happened with my injury, and the engagement at the club but there is a fun factor about this place now.
The squad is good and the team feels good; the training is also good.
We hope we can do our best, leave last season and succeed."
Women can't sleep because of the stress.
While the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be kept, some had already discussed it with their family members.
Half of the individuals in the Nationwide study estimated that they had discussed with their partner the cost of long-term relocation.
Only 10<0x25> talked to their children about it.
"They want family members to take care of them but take no steps to discuss," said Holly Snyder, deputy president of the insurance business Nationwide.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won't be able to provide a family to provide care for you if you don't tell them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as such options will be an important factor in knowing the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you get a way to pay for the expenses.
Funding for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help protect these expenses or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have the money.
Complete your legal documents: Complete the legal battle at a time.
Set up a health care representative in place so that you can appoint someone you trust to supervise your health care and make sure the professional is on your terms if you can't communicate.
You should also consider the power of attorney for your finances.
You'll choose people you trust to make decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you're not able to.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to rise.
In the absence of a communication system, authorities were unable to obtain information from Donggala's government, north of Palu, which is close to the epicenter of a magnitude 7.5 quake.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala government area 300 km (180 miles) off the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The region, a sub-regional administrative region, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the economic backbone of the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the waters of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in this region, but it is concentrated only in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by Tsumani several times in 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami has also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is constantly hit by earthquakes.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western region of Aceh, Indonesia north of Sumatra on Dec 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean waters, half of that in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake strikes southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hits the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang City, the capital of the West Sumatra region.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake strikes one of the Mentawai Islands, in Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroys dozens of villages and kills within 300 people.
2016: A moderate earthquake strikes the Pidie Jaya government area of Aceh, causing devastation and panic, reminding the population of the massive devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsumnami.
No tsunamis were triggered at the time, but more than 100 were killed due to the collapse of buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, especially in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska Governor-elect Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of carrying out the attack.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested, suspected of domestic assault, disrupted domestic terrorism crime reports and opposed detention, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, when a female friend tried to call the police to report the crime, she had taken the phone from the woman.
Palin was remanded at the Mat-Su pre-talk facility and held with an unsecured bond amounting to <0x24>500, KTUU reported.
He was brought to court on Saturday, where he confessed "definitely, innocently" when asked about the confession, the network reported.
Palin faces three minor Class A offenses, meaning she may be jailed for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He has also been charged under a Class B minor offence, punishable by a day in jail and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the attack.
The case was referred to the Alaska Military Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, tampering with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend accused the man of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by a veteran army group in 2016 after linking her son's violent actions to PTSD following his service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake: Hundreds Killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are also affected, with the death toll expected to rise by the next day.
The earthquake struck outside of Sulawesi, located in the northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos posted on social media indicate the time of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach celebrating a party in the city of Palu as the tsunami hit the beach.
U.S. prosecutors demand extraordinary death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
New York prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a New York City suspect in a terror attack that killed eight people -- an extraordinary sentence that has no longer been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West End Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his way on Oct.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors had to prove that Saipov "intentioned" to kill eight of the victims and "intended" to inflict serious bodily harm, according to a notice with intent to demand the death penalty, at a trial in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges lead to the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts including eight counts of murder for illegal activities, which prosecutors often used in organized crime, and one charge of terrorism and destroying motor vehicles.
The attack required "careful planning and planning", according to prosecutors, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "dangerous, cruel and despicable."
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to a notice with intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has long claimed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, has been charged with the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a New York federal case was executed was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not feel guilty in the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He made a statement to investigators that he was happy with what he was doing, according to police.
Saipov said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing an ISIS video on the phone, according to the allegations.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "extremely disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We feel the decision to demand the death penalty compared to receiving a guilty plea for life imprisonment with no possibility of release, only extends the trauma of this event to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense earlier asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
According to Tory MPs, NIGEL FARAGE should be held responsible for carrying out Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
Former Ukip chief said politicians should "feel the burn" from the Eurosceptics - because one of Theresa May's MPs, suggested she should be given the responsibility of conducting negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that the UK would "get out now" if Farage became Brexit secretary.
But the challenge May faces is to resolve the split between members who support the Tories' Remain Members who join the protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is working to ensure Chequers' tolerant plans remain in place amid attacks from Brexiteer, Remain and the EU.
The allies insist May is holding talks with Brussels despite the impact it faces - and Eurosceptic and Labour's power to choose between her package or 'disturbing'.
Bone said the Out rally meant Out in Solihull who wanted to 'throw away the Chequers'.
He recommended that Farage be made a nobleman and be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was given that responsibility, we'd be out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit but we must get rid of the Chequers."
Setting up a protest against the EU, he said: 'We are not fighting a world war to become slaves.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British had changed their minds and wanted to remain completely wrong.'
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the march, told reporters: "I just said: Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
"Chequers are not popular among the public, the Opposition will not vote in support, it is not popular in our party and the activities that are on the streets and who have voted for us.
"Shut up and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, she added: "The prime minister will continue to hold their posts if they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians had to "feel the stake" if they wanted to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'Now this is the trust between us - the people - and the political class,' he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them 'we're not going to let them get away with doing that.'
In a message to an enthusiastic audience he added: "I want you to make our political class, which almost betrays Brexit, to feel the heat.
"We are preparing a people's army that gives us victory in Bexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom independent, self-governing, proud."
Meanwhile, Remainer marched through Birmingham before holding a meeting in the middle of town.
A coalition of activists waved a banner of Tories Against Brexit after the group's launch over the weekend.
Lord Adonis's Labour peers mocked the Conservatives about the security issues they faced with party applications during the conference's inception.
"They said they could have IT systems in place and all the technology with Canada and so on, for borders without contradictions, for trade without borders," he added.
'It's all a play.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "research" to contest for president's post
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "study to run for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat delivered his future plans during a ‘town hall' in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November with GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He is expected to compete with Trump in 2020.
Saturday's noontime event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters using the "town hall" format since Trump took office.
One participant asked if he would like to contest for the office of president.
Warren replied it was time "for women to go to Washington to repair a broken kingdom, and this includes a woman on the top steps."
The arrest was made in the Sims shooting death of LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They had leaked a video of the shooting incident on Friday, asking for help to identify the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde acted in defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, having a gun and claiming to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained without incident and placed under the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6 ft 6 tall junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes the gap for the world championship when the team orders him to win, beating Sebastian Vettel
It was obvious at the time, Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday," the Mercedes team's direction played a key role in this race.
From the start of the grid, Bottas started well, nearly beating Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his team-mates.
Vettel got into the pit first and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, something that should have been final.
Mercedes then went into the pit on the next lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tyre action to the tyre that left the Ferrari driver free of the risk of defending himself after a third-corner defense.
Max Verstappen started from the back grid and finished seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead for most of the race and did not change tyres to target a quick finish and overtook Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He then went into the pits in the 44th round but was unable to increase the speed for the next eight rounds when Raikkonen was in fourth place.
It was a difficult day for Valtteri who had made a good race over the weekend and was of a gentlemanly nature allowing me to bypass.
The team has done a good job of winning first and second place," Hamilton said.
It's a bad language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday over the insistence of a woman he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not give a direct answer to the testimony given before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate showed people "cruel and ugly and liars."
"One thing can happen and beautiful things have happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, cruel and ugly people and liars," he said.
"When you look at the exposure and leaks and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you're leaking?
Remember the answer... did you divulge the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaking."
All right, wait a minute.
Are we leaking...No, we are not leaking," he added, making the senator's facial expressions.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugholeh Ford in July, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's allegations, I'm not leaking the story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He told me to keep it as hard and I kept it as hard as it was asked."
But the woman's denial was frowned upon by the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "I'm telling you, that's a bad language of motion.
Maybe he didn't do that, but that's the worst moving language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Agong Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the allegations to achieve their own ends.
“They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see, cruelty, obscenity, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrifice to gain power and control," Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored a goal for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee star made up for Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 comeback in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with a two-goal win over Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the hosts before Dwyer recovered the Giants' win.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured a win for them.
This was the Elite League's third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from the bottom to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The opening for Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
With what looked like a busy opening time, Sullivan raised the eyes of the hosts at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became an assistant to Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants won the game during the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The hosts then regrouped and Bouchard again equalised by scoring at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined to help Nielsen give Dundee their first win of the game late in the second period and he secured that victory with the fifth-placed team in mid-last season.
The Giants, who have lost four of their five games, are at home to Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Killed to Ensure Hundreds onboard Plane Passed Over Earthquake
Indonesia's Air Traffic Controller is considered a hero after he died after ensuring that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers managed to take off.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong tremors continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the ruins of Palu City.
Although his friend, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung, refused to leave his place of control at the powerful turbulent control tower at the Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport in Palu.
He did not move to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt the tower was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost it this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken listening to this news," he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is still rising as many bodies are still under rubble and many are unaccounted for," Sutopo's agency spokesman Purwo Nugroho said.
A 6 metre high wave has destroyed the Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings back the body.
Clean water is hard to get.
There's small shops all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross organization rushed to provide assistance to the survivors but we don't know what to find there.
It's a tragedy, but things can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to the transfer.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia has been hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a passenger is missing after plane crashes
The airline operating the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagun in Micronesia said one passenger was missing, having said all 47 passengers and crew were safely removed from the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, the company was unsure of the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water during an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the actual sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane had fallen off the runway.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane entered the runway in low condition.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to cross the waist-high water to the emergency door of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were in a state of panic and screaming, and he only got a minor injury to the head.
The U.S. navy said nearby crew members on the restored docks also provided assistance by using re-inflatable boats to move passengers to shore before the plane sank into 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network gave 111 people had been killed in a PNG-registered plane crash in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analysts give women's nighttime timelines burned alive
Prosecutors restated Saturday's case in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligent analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used mobile phone records to organize the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he was killed.
Rowlett said he received some location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the afternoon of his death, contradicting earlier allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed his cell phone along with Chambers's phone while he was claiming to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood in front of the court and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had been "tricked because my truck was in Nashville."
Trellis said she met Chambers two weeks before the woman's death.
Cell phone records show that they knew each other for only a week.
Rowlett said after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted Chamber's call text and contact information from his phone.
"He's taken the woman out of his life," Hale said.
The defense counsel is scheduled to begin a closing argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that evening.
The High Breed: Is hip hop sensitive?
The hip hop trio wanted to change the genre's negative outlook by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop has changed far from their original purpose, namely political message and solving social problems.
They want to go back to the basics and make hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen the latest revival in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
NY babysitter sues couple who fired her for "racist" text
New York's nanny sued the couple for discriminated against after receiving a text sent from a mother complaining that she was "another black."
The couple denied they were racist, equating the act of suing it as "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"There's no such thing as a black hole," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the text.
She wanted to send the text to her husband, instead she had sent the message to Maurice, twice.
Upon becoming aware of his guilt, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "uncomfortable" had fired Maurice, and said that his previous nanny, an African-American, was not doing a good job and he was expecting a nanny from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one working day and sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, and is demanding compensation in <0x24>350 a day for six months, indemnity for the housing he has offered, even if there is no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't have done that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discriminatory."
The couple have retaliated against claims that they were racist, saying the act of terminating Maurice's services was justified because they felt the woman was untrustworthy after offending the woman.
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But would you put your child's care on someone you've been rude to, even if it's a mistake?
Your newborn?
Not at all."
Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a "difficult situation."
“You want to wear someone in a situation like that?
"It's not a bad thing," added the banker.
As the case progressed, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, attacking them against their actions and logic.
Paddington publishers worry readers will find it difficult to get in touch with talking bears, new letter reveals
Bond's son, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of the person reading the book first before the book is published.
It's heartbreaking to know now about Paddington's success."
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book, a small toy bear, was optimistic about her work being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweetly bitter" after her father's death last year.
About Paddington, he described as "the most important member of our family," he added, his father was proud of his success in the end.
"A quiet father, he's not a big talker," he said.
"But, because Paddington is too alive for her, it's like feeling like you have a child who achieves something you're proud of even if it's not the one you made it.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although the bear was his invention and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My son is dying and I have to say goodbye over the phone.
After landing, the girl's son was sent to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, Nice in a hurry where doctors had worked hard to save his life.
"Nad called me frequently to say that the situation was severe and he would not be saved," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, baby.
I'll be by your side soon.
I'll be with you.
The drug given by the doctor to pump his heart slowly exits and leaves his system.
He died before his time and this is all turned off.
I just sat there and waited, knowing this was all going to happen.
I can't scream or scream because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to arrest him."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in mourning over the loss of her son, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were clueless about the bitter experience she had.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I bow my head, and tears flow all the time.
It's hard to describe, but on this trip I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad.
You need my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.”
Woman sent a postcard to avoid killing herself on a bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one who committed suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to contact for support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want anyone to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney, said his son was a potential cook with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knows him with a smile.
They always say that their smile can turn on any room."
However, he stopped working before he died, because he was in "a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old sister at the time, met her brother after her brother committed suicide.
Davis said: "I'm constantly worried if this will cause the effects of other things to happen."
Davis created the card, "to let people know that there are people you can meet and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit in silence - you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner of 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling sad or depressed or anything,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his attitude.
He was very sad on Christmas Day – When the kids opened their gifts, he didn’t look at them or anything.”
He said the death of his partner was a major trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "He made a big hole in the family.
It made us split up.
But we have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs as the FBI begins its investigation
"I think, if we can get what he wants - a limited-time investigation, a limited scope - we can lead to unity," Flake said on Sunday, adding that the committee's "mistakes" in the deadlock are based on deeply rooted beliefs.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their weakness is due to their insecurities.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, and on November 6 - if as expected, the Republican results are unsatisfactory, they will grow weaker to get the person they want to appoint to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush had made a call to the Senators, lobbying them in favor of Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and through Bush had met his wife Ashley, who became secretary to Bush.
What will happen after the FBI prepares a report?
The vote will be run in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate seat, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to equalize the series and confirm his position on the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors 'dropped' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has dwindled since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to South Korea's legislature.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by people smugglers were a major factor.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Most North Korean defectors will be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Free Army Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than political refugees and often sends them back by force.
Relations between the North and the South - technically still at war - have improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on talks on a delayed nuclear disarmament.
This comes after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in a general sense to head towards nuclear-free on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US sanctions of slowing the progress of negotiations since the incident.
"Without any trust from the United States, our national security is not guaranteed and therefore, we will not initiate nuclear disarmament first," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "emotional," and not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "emotional" and said his appointment was not suitable for holding office in the Mahlamah Agong.
Pelosi made the following review in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe if a woman behaves like that, they will say the woman is 'emotional,'" Pelosi said of the reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that she had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both teenagers.
At the opening of his statement, Kavanaugh was emotional, sometimes almost screaming and crying when discussing family and while in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "exaggerated and defamatory" managed by the still-angry liberal Hilary Clinton killed in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that she was not eligible to hold a position on the Supreme Court, as it showed that she was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's done away with his own credentials and his actions against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrat gets a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if he didn't speak truth to Congress and the FBI, he wouldn't be eligible to hold office in the Supreme Court, but only in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as she was perceived as a conservative court.
In the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh refrained from answering whether he would change the decision of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an emotional, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'What a lot of fun,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to show it.
It’s a natural word, an inflammation that’s months and years abundant, and she doesn’t hold back her anger without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything special, do you?"
She continued, "I was helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who said she also cried when she was angry, but had invented a technique, if she felt angry and started to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
Then he continued.
And I think that's a wise suggestion."
Crying is allowed as a way of channeling anger because it is always misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of an old job, in a male-dominated office, I found me crying with irrepressible temper tantrums, I was pulled by an older woman in the neck - a cold manager whom I feared - pulled me into the stairwell.
"Don't show them your tears," she told me.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to make you sad."
Patricia Schroeder, a former congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during her presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an affair in a bot called Monkey Business out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, felt there was no reason to prevent her from joining the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a carefully planned decision," he said laughing at me 30 years later.
"There are seven more candidates competing and they don't need another candidate.
Some call Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because of the events that took place at the end of the campaign, the woman was left behind in an attempt to set up a tube, and she vowed not to compete as long as she did not earn <0x24>2 million.
It was a futile struggle.
He found his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to the man would give him only <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'm going to get fired?" he asked.
When she said she wasn't going to launch a formal campaign, she felt a variety of emotions - grateful to those who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it difficult for her to ask for donations and who targeted non-candidate voters, and angry at sexism - and she felt gunfire.
"You'd think I was heartbroken," Schroeder recalled of the way the media reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember when I thought about it, what would put on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The start of the trade war between the U.S. and China may be puzzling, and while the fighting is not over yet, the dispute between the two countries is likely to benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on Chinese exports including solar, iron and aluminum panels.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs that would affect the <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) value of items, such as imposing taxes on half of goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing retaliates in the same way every time, most recently, imposes five to ten percent tariffs on 60 billion American goods.
China has vowed to repay the U.S. each for action, and the world's second-largest economy is not impressed.
To make Washington resign means to submit to the will of the United States, but bowing to the United States is too embarrassing for <0x58>i Jinping, the Chinese president.
According to experts, if Beijing plays the cards correctly, the pressure of the U.S. Trade War could positively support China in the long run by lowering the .
"A quick political decision by whether Washington or Beijing can start an unchecked economic situation in any country and looks more dangerous than what observers previously understood," said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of political refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says the country is ready for a willing return of the country's political refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country destroyed by the seven-year war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made to combat terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore to normal conditions.
The situation now prepares for the willing return of refugees, to the country they had to leave due to the violence and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
More than 5.5 million Syrians have fled Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to develop the devastated country.
But he insisted the country would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries supporting the uprising.
Winner of the Ryder Cup in Paris

Europe regained the crown when Captain Thomas Bjorn's team got the 14.5 matga needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, grappling throughout the match, released a tee shot into the water at the 16th par-3 hole, succumbing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfers excelled in all rounds, being 1st out of 4 players to be 5-0-0 since the format of the competition began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was pulled out at 5<0x26>4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, dropped to 2nd and 1st to Ian Poulter of England who may have played last time for the Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia became Europe's all-time winner with a top 25.5 points.
“I rarely cry but can’t stand it today.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful that Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm very happy, happy to get the trophy back.
This is for the team, and I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia said after the European triumph.
He has handed over duties to John Ram who has defeated U.S. legend Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I'm proud to say that when I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all competitions in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 Ryder Cup work.
Odd statistics by one of the greatest players, winning 14 major championships in second place only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team struggled throughout the weekend to find a track, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played good golf throughout the match.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing performance of his team, "I feel proud of them, they worked hard.
This morning, we're going to give a shout out to the Europeans.
We tried our best.
Congratulations Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players played brilliantly.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee and we're going straight ahead.
I love all 12 of these guys and am proud to be a captain.
You need to lift the hat.
We have been defeated."
