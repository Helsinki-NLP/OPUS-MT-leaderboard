I hope you didn't write it.
You're going to have to make the squeaky clean.
Let's say you're squirming.
You'll have to be careful when you're on your own.
You still need help.
It's still open.
You didn't write, not even call.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
You came down.
You came down.
You won.
You won.
You'll never do that.
You'll never do that.
You'd never do it.
You'll never make it.
