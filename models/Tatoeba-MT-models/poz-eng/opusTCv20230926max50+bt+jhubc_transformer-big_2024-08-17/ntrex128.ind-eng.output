Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) were concerned that they ‘looked like puppet muppets'.
There was concern among some AMs towards a suggestion that their designation should have been changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/ Member of Welsh Parliament).
This arose due to a plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned if it can invite ridicule.
An AM of the labor party said that his group was concerned, "The designation is similar to Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
A member of the assembly (AM) said that his group as a unit, felt "unhappy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but judged that this was a departure from the MWP's abbreviation to Muppet.
In this context the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any explanation of the designation for the AMs is certainly a matter for the members themselves."
The 2017 Government of Wales decision authorized the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on a proposal known to gain broad support to refer to the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of designations of AMs, the Commission preferred WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option gained the most support on public consultation.
The AMs appear to be proposing an alternative option, but the struggle to reach a consensus could upset the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill within weeks.
This reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including disqualification rules for AMs and the drafting of the committee system.
AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss legislation.
The people of Macedonia went to vote on a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor shows a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected offers of EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the vote for a name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bells do not ring when the Churches in Harlem are in trouble
"Historically, the old people I talked to said there used to be a bar and a church in every corner," Mr. Adam said.
"Today, there is no one."
He said that the disappearance of all the bars was understandable.
"People socialize in other ways" these days, he said.
"The bar is no longer the living room of the surrounding community where people visit it regularly."
As well as the church, he was concerned that the money from the sale of assets would not last as long as the leaders had hoped, "and sooner or later they would come back again from the start."
The churches, he added, could be replaced with apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not help keep the remaining shrines around.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white people," he said, "and therefore will hasten the day when these churches close simultaneously because it is unlikely that those who moved to these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
Black churches that had worshipped in the surrounding area had taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of retail merchants on 125th street, the main street to shop in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 caused the building to be severely damaged, but when Reverend Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild, they built the tower bells.
The Reverend David Johnson, the Son of the Reverend Johnson and his successor in St. Martin proudly referred to the tower bell as the "Bell of the Poor"
An expert who rang the tower bell in July gave him another designation: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable instrument of history."
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the first tower bell in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind who switched to ringing the larger tower bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months is an elaborate story of architecture and contractors, some brought by lay church leaders, and others brought by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the governing body of the diocese, formed of lay leaders - wrote a letter to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would seek to charge" the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old in California lobster dive
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived to catch a lobster in California during the lobster season's opening event, an official said.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then rowed in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a burst of excitement after catching the lobster, but then he "realised" that the boy was shouting, 'I got bitten!
I was bitten!'
His whole collarbone was torn," Hammel said that he realized it when he had already grabbed the child.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Beach Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark had been seen in the area one week earlier, but that it was categorized as a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim sustained severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed access to beaches ranging from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative purposes and for security reasons.
Giles is aware that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan to break the British beauty market
Sainsbury's took over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with convenience-style beauty stalls run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial boost to the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion UK beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion products and household appliances are declining, larger beauty stalls will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if that proves successful.
Investment in beauty has become a hunting ground for supermarkets to utilize shelves that used to be used as a place to display TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of brands starting from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with branded areas such as those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup line so that most of its products will be vegan-friendly – something that is increasingly in demand by young shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon. South London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching to buying small amounts of daily food needs in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, has said that the stalls will increasingly look like the Mall as the supermarket chain seeks to fight back against suppressors such as Aldi and Lidl by providing more and no-food service.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat outlets since they bought the two franchises two years ago, which it says have supported daily grocery sales and made more profitable acquisitions.
Previous supermarket attempts to renovate the beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a dispute over how to split the profits from the chemical store in the supermarket.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmaceutical store businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical franchise, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial director, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of beauty stalls to improve the atmosphere for the sake of our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand range is designed to suit all needs, an enthralling environment and a convenient location signalling that we are currently an enthralling destination that challenges the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘grew up' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones went ‘in rage' after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle business deal to focus more on her new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby did not have time to manage the trademarks of their household appliances and accessories, Truly.
The couple's business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of This Morning, aged 37, used her Instagram account to announce that she was out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons" Den star, Petes Jones angered by withdrawing at the last moment, from their lucrative branded lifestyle business – to focus on her larger contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources stated that Jones was so "greedy" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their home appliances and accessories trademark, Truly.
Their business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune by <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his vacation homes,
A source said: "Truly by far Holly's most important priority.
That would have been his long-term future, which would have made him last for decades to come.
His decision to step down left everyone involved really dumbfounded.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it is so close to launch time.
There is a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain’s most expensive stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to huge investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, as well as the potential for further delays in the launch.
And this can mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple were on holiday together and Jones owned a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV host titled I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on this business relationship."
Speaking seriously ‘and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for making comments that some considered "unpresidential" and had been very positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a voice of ridicule his "news readers".
"I didn't give up anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting a second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a step forward for North Korea's denuclearization.
But denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament movement.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump is more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing our best with North Korea,” he said.
“We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this amazing relationship."
He said that his success to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results – stopping the rocket experiment, helping free hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d better have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental foreign organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population is homeless, there is no national disaster statement, as a prerequisite to bringing in international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is a bit challenging,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save The Children is putting together a team to leave for Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said that Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to provide assistance.
Given the constant shock of the earth experienced by Indonesia, this country is still very unprepared to face the anger of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although danger warnings have been reported, is likely to have contributed to the death toll.
In the best of times, traveling between many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A floating hospital that has been placed in Lombok to care for earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to Indonesia’s damaged infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of highways and railways.
But lack of funds has disrupted Mr Joko’s government while he faces re-election next year.
Mr Joko also faces pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes as Muslim and Christian mobs fought on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a balancing goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League by a score of 89 minutes on Saturday at London’s Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from outside Chelsea's goal when his side were 1-0 down.
He placed the ball on his left side before kicking it towards the far pole.
The ball bounces high above the goal when the ball bounces into the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming in and taking one chance and not thinking too much about it, and just doing the kicks.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the first half after Belgium's Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue attacker gave feedback to Mateo Kovacic on the game, before spinning near midfield and running fast into central Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly fed and ran in midfield.
He then performed a perfect kick, leading Hazard towards the goal.
Hazard made it past the opposing defender and kicked the ball into the corner with a left foot kick, past Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool beat Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude Richter earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, was filled with collapsed building debris.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation has been carried out after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John street, at 7:55 a.m. with multiple stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was detained on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people around who saw or heard something to come face to face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still at an early stage but I ask everyone who was around John's street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may be recording something on the dashboard camera to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt confident that they knew the woman had come to the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing as police have said, they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just returned to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man couldn’t say anything when he found out what had happened.
The residents are currently being told that it will take several hours until they are allowed to re-enter.
A police officer was heard telling someone that all areas were now being imposed as the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared at the scene in tears.
He always repeats ‘this is terrible'.
At 2 p.m. two police vans were in line and the others were outside.
A number of officers stood in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCc, phone 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 citing log 247 on September 30.
The statue of Parliament of Cromwell became the last memorial affected by ‘historical rewriting'
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the Taliban’s destruction of many British cultural and religious artifacts carried out by fanatical Puritans.
But Cromwell's society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "this is inevitable in the current debate about the destruction of the statues, that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster will be targeted.
English civil war iconoclasm was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong descendants of Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The remarkable representation of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a 19th-century proof of opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is still worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course the kingdom.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation, is still the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century had shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell was an individually recognizable figure who represented one side of that difference.
His success as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Murderer's pig persecutes Chinese farmer to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pig stable in the Liupanshui area market of Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject the vaccine into pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in <0x58>ining province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have left with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the nearby pig barn door had opened.
He said that in the pig pen there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
Forensic research confirmed that the 550-pound male pig had mistreated the breeder to death, according to reports.
"My cousin's calf is bleeding and shattered," said the cousin known by the surname "Wu", as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks against humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachussett resulting in the man being seriously injured.
10 years earlier, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer onto his tractor until his wife scared him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the smell of blood could act as "triggers".
"They're just playing games.
They're biters, very curious...they won't come out to hurt you.
You just have to give him enough respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa brought torrential rain extending into the southwestern United States.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over cooler waters off Mexico's northern coast.
In any case, Rosa will cause flooding across northern and southwestern Mexico in the coming days.
Rosa has winds at 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, starting at 5 a.m. Eastern Region time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely moving northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Trench began to form over the Pacific Ocean and move east, towards the U.S. West Coast, when Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began pushing tropical moisture northward up to the U.S. southwest.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rain in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, streams of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause rainfall levels to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour at some points, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected to fall in some parts of the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Flash floods are likely to occur with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the nature of scattered tropical rains.
It is not recommended to explore the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause the ravine to become a violent river and the storm will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching trough will cause local heavy rain to part of Southern California's coastline.
Total rainfall exceeding half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to become slippery.
This will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before the rains become more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will extend to four quarters on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some severe temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There were precise examples of dramatic temperature differences along the central U.S. territory on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will form and re-spread.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. territory is expected to start warm beginning in October with a rapid spread of 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is expected to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a high chance for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular events to report an unexpected last-minute incident Friday: A deal Arizona Senator Jeff Flake designed for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh groped her body drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, have watched it.
The company counts average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counts for other networks that broadcast this were not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually had difficulty counting the number of people who witnessed it in the office.
To put this in perspective, it is an almost the same number of viewers as a football playoff game or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose host strongly supports Kavanaugh's appointment, excels at all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Fans remained high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on camera CNN and CBS on Friday morning was being shouted at by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was reviled, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think that he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have strength when there are many helpless women.”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in the committee hearing.
Cable TV and broadcast networks all covered live hours later, when the Justice Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy to the rest of the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would examine the allegations against the candidate over the next week, as the minority Democrats had requested.
Flake has been reassured in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was clear that the Republican party would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh in the absence of an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of ‘playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests, over her plans to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews featuring him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that proposals about Britain and the EU having to collect tariffs on each other were "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and in prison on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said that they found Simpson's DNA on the item, CBS's WAFB affiliate reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to having committed a fatal shooting of Wayde.
His contract had been set at <0x24>350,000, the Advocate reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head to the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and surrounding residents in assisting with the investigation leading up to the arrests.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked the region's law enforcement for "persistence and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
With a height of 6.6 feet living in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and soared to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano spews ash in Mexico City
The ash coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern area around the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash in more than 24 hours.
The center monitored several times the rumble and vibration.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash sticking to the windshield of a car in the neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence election celebrations.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after participants of pro-independence demonstrations clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarization vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by riot police pelted them with eggs and threw powder paint, creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that tourists would normally fill.
The dispute also occurred later in the day with police using their staff to control the dispute.
For several hours pro-independence groups chanted "Not forgetting, no forgiveness" confronted union protesters who shouted, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in this independent-oriented region, a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters prefer to be independent, despite low voter turnout in the presence of those who oppose secession and largely boycott the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting on polling stations across the region in fierce clashes.
Pro-independence groups have camped out overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support national police.
Demonstrations continued but were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending a separatist protest with his wife said he no longer expected about Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy at being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” she said.
Despite winning a vital victory despite a few regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders, either in exile or in custody awaiting trial, over their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest with her phone in support of police, said that the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more stressful," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed pre-trially since the end of last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament election.
"Standing as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the setbacks in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage occurred to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired towards the car at some point.
A goal scored by Menga gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Livingston's win resulted in the Rangers sacking Steven Gerrard from his post as Ibrox club manager, for his second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side's move equalled Hibernian's second.
Gerrard’s side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face leaders Hearts who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten record in the division to six games, while head coach Holt has still racked up defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a chance against a sloppy guest team
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their accuracy giving the Rangers various difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but missed his attempt across the face of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only widen his effort after sliding in and facing Craig Halkett's header from across the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in the lead at the start, knowing that they could make it difficult for the team to come off the ball.
And that’s the way to come up with a very important goal.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston got the chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got the turn and scored from midfield.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated possession but realized that the home defence was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly as a whole was undisturbed,
That pattern continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to lure a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was punted by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's foot and Lithgow was knocked out far as a result of another Livingston game tactic.
The attack continued to come to Livingston's goal and was constantly avoided, while two penalty claims – after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball – were rejected.
‘Fenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
For a man, they were incredible, continuing to exceed expectations on this ever-rising trajectory.
Their playing style and personnel have barely changed since they returned to the top, but great credit must be given to Holt for the way he strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert during the game.
Despite this, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was less than good – only once they could break up the formation of the home side – and that became a warning to Rangers, who were aware of their presence in the middle of the pitch.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received mixed reception in Cologne.
There was a smile and a stretch of blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They are at odds over issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks located outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a crowd of 25,000 gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also voiced, denouncing both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The resistance described the opposition to the existence of an immigrant who was welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as a dictator by others.
Deptford highway collision: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car had stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about 1 mile away from the collision Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads were closed and bus lane diversions had been imposed and motorists were urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a man’s prison with tight guard, the office said.
Chaos arose at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST (GMT<0x2B>0100) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been deployed to deal with the unrest, which involved eight prisoners and occurred on one side of the building.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained outlaw officers have been deployed to deal with the incident that is taking place at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend a longer time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison chief was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year riot police were called to prison to deal with a serious riot in which a law enforcement officer was attacked with a billiard ball.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Flooding (Drought Areas May Benefit)
Tropical depressions that hit Arizona are rare, but that's what's likely to happen early next week as the remaining energy trails of Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwest desert, posing a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings of flash floods on Monday and Tuesday for the Western Arizona region to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly past Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting Monday night with rain.
The National weather service in Phoenix mentioned on Twitter that there have only been "ten tropical cyclones capable of causing tropical storms or depressive status within 200 miles of the Phoenix region since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border region."
The latest Hurricane Center Forecaster is able to predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with isolated amounts reaching 6 inches at Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the southwest desert including central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to be exposed 1 to 2 inches, with a possible number of isolates reaching 4 inches.
For those in the flash flood-free region, Rosa's rain may be a blessing as the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is most likely favorable because currently the southwest region is being hit by drought.
According to U.S. drought watchers, only about 40 percent of Arizona’s area is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category,” weather.com reported.
First, the path through which Hurricane Rosa leads to land across Baja California on the Mexican peninsula
Rosa, still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered areas of cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore weakened its strength.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall may be high in parts of Mexico, posing a high risk of flooding
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected to hit the Baja California region as far as the southwestern Sonora region, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then traverse the north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will pass through Arizona and into southern Utah at midnight Tuesday.
"The main risks that Rosa or its remnants may pose are very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora region, and the U.S. Southwest U.S. desert region." The National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated.
The rains are expected to cause a threat of flash floods and debris from buildings flowing into the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Arrest of four suspected attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The male teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton region, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was "stable".
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset counties, police said.
Officers had already called on anyone who might have a video recording of the incident on his phone to come and report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh ‘received hatred and anger' from Democrats
"One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democrats' cruel and shameful scheme," Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, west Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "received the hatred and anger" of the Democrats during the nomination process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcefully and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually assaulted him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"One vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to affirm someone who has the most perfect legal thinking of our time, a jury with a track record of a true public servant," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when talking about the importance of Republican participation in mid-elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m really racing,” he said.
"That's why I went here, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "fight and block."
The first procedural vote on the Senate level in Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to be implemented no later than Friday, an aide to the senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by Indonesia's earthquake, tsunami, with the death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away as giant waves hit the coast, as a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18-foot) high wave destroyed the beach at dusk, causing many deaths and destroying anything it passed.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat escalated yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away so they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, wood, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed the high seas at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shoreline.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centres in Palu.
Air photos released by the BNPB showed many buildings and shops destroyed, a crooked bridge and collapsed as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
A series of aftershocks rocked the city along the coast on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Study and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy expended in Friday's massive quake was about 200 times stronger than the explosive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, can magnify the size of the tsunami, it can be said so.
Nugroho described the damage that occurred as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of several of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could have been greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication was "completely paralyzed in the absence of information from Donggala," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that members and their volunteers were heading for the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse," he said.
The relevant agency on Saturday received much criticism for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the wave had already hit at the time the warning was issued.
An amateur recording shared on social media showed a man upstairs in a building shouting warnings in panic about a tsunami approaching, towards people on the streets below.
Within minutes a roll of water slammed into the beach, swept away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately prove the authenticity of the tape.
Earthquakes and tsunamis are the biggest cause of power outages that cut off communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the refugees are still in dire need of food and other essentials.
The airport has already reopened only to channel relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll of the Indonesian Tsunami has risen above 800.
That's awful.
When the employees of World Vision from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where they took refuge in a tarpaulin tent built in their office yard, on their way they had passed through various congested areas, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen a lot of homes destroyed," he said.
That's awful.
Even as the relief group began to move slowly to begin disaster relief activities, some of the group complained of the ban on foreign volunteers with expertise, who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesia’s regulations, funding, aid for goods and power from abroad can only begin to be channelled if the affected area has been officially declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the time the Government said, OKE, this is a national disaster," we were able to receive international aid, but there was no such status.
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and family of the missing victims still hope that their loved ones will be part of a miracle that will improve the grim storyline of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been wedged under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has been the coach of two missing paragliding athletes, who had attended the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel, along with Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my personal emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how after news of the destroyed Roa-Roa Hotel circulated around the paragliding community, he desperately sent a WhatsApp message to the Palu competitors, who took part in the celebration on the beach.
However, all the messages, only got one gray tick, instead of two blue ticks.
"I think that means the message wasn't sent," he said.
The robbers took <0x24>26,750 during an ATM charge at Newport in the Levee
The robbers on Friday morning, stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM machine storage box in Newport, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had already emptied an ATM machine at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a news report.
While he was at work, another man "runs from behind the Brink workers" and steals one bag containing money to send.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to reports, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Anyone with information about their identity can contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “What used to be formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, had already had the nickname Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously said that for him the word had religious meaning.
“I believe ‘yes’ is a commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that name is us.
The name is taken from Kanye, which means only one, being Ye – as a mirror of our goodness, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our true selves."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has variously been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator JAY-Z also made it with or without a liaison sign and a capital letter.
Mexico's president, AMLO, vowed not to use the military in the face of civil society
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians ahead of the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised the day on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to pressure the Mexican people."
Troops opened fire on peaceful demonstrations in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people that time, when left-wing students’ movements planted their roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is already guaranteeing support for young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those attending college and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encouraged young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. is supposed to double A.I. funding.
As China is more active in terms of artificial intelligence, the U.S. is supposed to double the amount of funding to be used for research in the field, said A2 investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who already works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. as a whole lacked a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: aiming to be number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Drawing AI research funds is a good start, given that all other countries tend to lag far behind the U.S., and we’re looking for the next breakthrough in the field of AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances so that the next big AI milestone will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, owner of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” was already published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has already invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beats the best American Othello players, and after that he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology rivalries such as the Robotics Challenge for the Advanced Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win prizes from the Government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leadership; it’s a company,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have already hired figures from universities for AI research in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. to support efforts around AI.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for PHD degree holders in the field of AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions in the same way the Natural Science Foundation and other governmental organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic tasks is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA (the Advanced Defense Research Agency) announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, DARPA recently invested more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has seen no follow-up for months.
Macedonian people vote in order to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday to decide on the country's name change to the "Republic of North Macedonia," an action that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that had barred its offer of membership to become part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor represents recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
The two sides reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opposition argued that the change would undermine the identity of most of Macedonia's ethnic Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not cast his vote at the general election and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the election results could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the votes required for the election to be declared valid.
The question on the ballot reads: "Do you approve NATO and EU membership by accepting a treaty with Greece."
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for obtaining entry into bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of Yugoslavia's destruction.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the sake of the young generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough lawmakers say they will abide by the results of the vote to make a decision.
The name change requires a vote of two-thirds in parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
Nevertheless, it turned out that the vote was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters gave their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, where we are in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko give their ballots for elections in Macedonia in order to change the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, had already prepared a small stage and pulled seats in front of tents made by those who would boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join honorably, not through the servant's door" said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most of the population will approve it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his ballot.
He said the "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institution on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the required number.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For such a vote to be successful, it takes 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A vote failure would represent the first policy rejection of a pro-Western government since taking over in May last year.
Witness: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scoured all of Brighton's defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton's defence in Saturday's 2-0 Manchester City win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received an pass midfield at the start of the match.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before recklessly breaking into an open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four men in green shirts.
He twisted past one defender before running ahead of several more opponents at the end of Brighton's goal.
Then he passed to his left, to Sterling.
The England forward used his first kick from goal to pass the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his legs," Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal occurred in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, deep inside Brighton's territory on that game.
He passed the ball with a stunning away kick through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little bit of scramble of the ball before leading Sterling to the furthest post.
The Sky Blue forward dribbles the ball towards the goal just before the ball slides out of the border.
City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to complain of spoilers versus Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no more reason to force another game.
But the overly competitive Scherzer hopes to outperform the Colorado Rockies in Sunday’s game, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who excel in one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned a place after winning a wild-card game against the Nationals by a score of 5-2 on Friday night, yet are still trying to clinch their first division title.
"Even though we played without a win, we can at least know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and other teams that will be competing at the highest level from any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in a match like that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the opening match for Sunday, but it is reported that under such circumstances, they are likely to let Scherzer compete.
Scherzer, who will start the game for the 34th time, held a training session on Thursday and started Sunday's game normally used to rest.
Washington's right-handed pitcher was an 18-7 scorer with a 2.53 run average and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings of this session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The president implicitly refers to the situation surrounding his chosen Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he talks about the importance of the Republican vote in mid-election.
"All the efforts we've made are at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election of our lives.
It's one of those big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting all over the place for an incredible candidate," he said.
Trump continued, “You see a very, very, very horrible, radical Democratic group, you can see it happening right now.
And they decide to take back power by any means, you see the evil, their abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to punish in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want, that’s power and control, we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you saw it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and evil and vile and unbelievable."
He referred to the Senate's Dianne Feinstein who served on the Senate Judiciary Committee by calling his name, which was met with loud slurs from his listeners.
"Remember what the answer was?
Have you leaked the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it - it's very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a place of public service.
He is now intolerant of anyone who puts his mind to it.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to denounce me, it was no surprise.
After all, I was in the last order of the Members of Parliament, who were told that our presence was not expected - all because we were expressing an opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she defended anti-Semitism firmly.
In my case, the denunciation movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, the issue is ironically the same as that which Jeremy Corbyn opposed with previous leaders.
The notice for the eastern Nottingham workers' meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For almost eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on Friday Night was exactly that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises regarding "better, friendlier" politics has not long been forgotten, if, indeed it has ever begun.
Differences of opinion in the workers' party are increasingly clearly intolerable and each opinion is judged its worthiness by the party's authority.
It began as soon as Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague whom I had thought would share the same political views, began to expect me to turn around and accept a position that I would never have accepted before - whether in national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak openly - and no matter what I say - then there will be followed by a slur on social media asking for the cancellation of the appointment, denouncing central politics, telling me I shouldn't have served in the Labour party.
And it wasn’t just me who experienced it.
Sure, I know that I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments aimed at me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual harassment or racism every day but never dodge.
One of the most disappointing aspects in today's political era is how level of abuse has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should have helped develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer on the wider church and with every "unconfident" motion or changing the party's regulatory selection to be more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that encouraged me to keep my head down, not voice my opinion too much, and then I would say "Okay."
But I’m not into politics to do that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when it was still a school student, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government that resulted in my comprehensive school class literally collapsing, I have been trying to fight for better public services for those who desperately need it - both as a local counselor and minister in government.
I have never concealed my political actions, including at the last election.
No one in East Nottingham would question my policy position and the things I disagree with in the current leadership.
For those advocating Friday’s motion, all I can say is that when the country moves quickly toward a division of sovereignty, it will jeopardize our country’s business and public services, I don’t want to waste time and energy for the sake of loyalty to the leader of the Labour party.
But really, my one message is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, as a Labour party member or not. I'm proud to serve you and I promise that there is no threat of removal or any political policy that will prevent me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr rises to the top
The last two tries may have rigged the final result a bit, but Ayr undoubtedly deserved to win a very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
Now they were at the top, the only unbeaten side out of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and the ability to grab the best chances, earned the home team and coach Peter Murchie the right to feel good.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still unbeaten so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Awards for Ayr, they are better at taking chances compared to the ones we do."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, given in that game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Baggot scooped up an unconverted try.
Climo relieved Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, right in mid-time, he scored then made a single try to make Ayr's score 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try was converted by Baggot, reducing the chances to five points.
Then there was a long pause as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury, was stretchered out, and since the restart of the game, Ayr went faster beyond Stafford McDowall's attempt, converted by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then struck by a yellow card and again, Melrose made a backup player pay with Bruce Colvine's unconverted try, at the end of a hard pressure.
The hosts had returned to play, however, by the time Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for cornering Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind the injured forward Ayr.
Climo was replaced, as it happened again, almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe scored and thwarted Gregor Henry's fifth attempt.
Still Game star looks ready to embark on his new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Kieran is seen ready to move into the service industry after it was discovered that he was named a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis's role on the BBC's popular show, which he directed and also starred alongside his longtime comedian colleague, Greg Hemphill.
The pair had already announced that the upcoming ninth series was the final episode, and apparently Kiernan planned to guide the live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to official record lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was trying to get involved in "a thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours: Bolivia, surrounded by the mainland, hopes that the courts will re-open the path to the Pacific.
Sailors conducted patrols at the launch force headquarters located in La Paz.
The public building raised a blue sea flag.
The naval base from Titicaca to the Amazon was polished with the motto: "The sea is our legitimate property.
To rise again is an obligation."
Passing through mainland-surrounded Bolivia, the memory of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a bloody conflict of the 19th century is still clear – as is the desire to once again cross the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to peak in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and certainly positive expectations about the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ trial on the big screen across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia's claim that - after decades of tense negotiations -Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia's guarantee of sovereignty over the ocean.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for a re-election next year - also has a lot of support at Monday's hearing.
"We're very close to the Pacific Ocean return," he vowed in late August.
But some analysts are convinced that the court is unlikely to decide Bolivia's wishes- and that would change little if that were possible.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to hand over Chile's territory, and has already determined that it will not decide the outcome of the possible negotiations.
That the ICJ's ruling comes just six months after the final argument has been heard, which indicates the case is "uncomplicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean international legal expert.
And still a long way from continuing Bolivia’s claims, in the last four years it may have been a setback.
"The issue of access to the sea is being hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has already weakened the goodwill of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point remain in talks, but it will be very difficult to stay in touch after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, representative of the Bolivian government in The Hague rejected the idea of quick decision-making.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales—still one of Latin America’s most famous presidents—used the maritime issue as a political backer.
Bolivia will never relinquish its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The conference is an opportunity to see what we need to resolve the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made the statement on Saturday during the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned about the United States carrying out a deal made at a meeting in Singapore between competing leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was seen nearly starting nuclear diplomacy that had been deadlocked for more than three months after a meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was only a "fake dream" that by continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the Korean War's resolution would make North Korea surrender.
Washington is on the lookout to approve the declaration in the absence of Pyongyang making efforts to limit the armed forces first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the recognition of the arsenal that for the country is the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
The Paris fashion show showcases the latest collection of head coverings all the way to the main street near you
If you want to multiply the collection of hats or really want to be protected from the sun do not look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne issued a series of large-sized head coverings for their SS19 collection on the fashion show stage in a stunning style held at Paris Fashion Week.
The really impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers are already showcasing eye-catching creations on the stage.
What stands out from Valentino is a cream-colored hat over which is decorated with a wide fringe of fur tubs that cover the model's head.
Large size accessories include a watermelon decorated with diamonds, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also shows a collection of strange masks - and right in the lead-up to Halloween.
Many masks of various colors whose lips have been stitched and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
A creation similar to scuba diving gear is equipped with snorkels and eyeglasses, while the others look like melted ice cream.
And if you continue to browse through those huge fashion collections – then you’re in luck.
Fashion observers estimate that such a large collection of hats will be marketed to the main street near you.
Large size hats became a very best-selling trend in ‘La Bomba', straw hats with a two-foot wide rim seen worn by everyone including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The veneration of the label behind the very impractical hats of social media makes a huge creation on the beach catwalk—a bag of straw that is almost the same size as a swimsuit—wearing a model of a sling.
The burned orange rafia bag, trimmed with rafia on the edge with a white handle strap, is a standout from Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see a big hat and beach bag arrive on the main road for next summer - as designers are already making a big impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for such big accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with outstanding test results, which were further strengthened by each student and collective success in sport, art, music and hard work.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Board (SCIS) strive to provide the best service for students and parents.
The independent school aims to prepare its students for advanced and higher education, their career of choice, and their role as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a school curriculum as expected, we see modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, your speech will go to his head.
If you talk to him in his language then your speech will go to his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s latest exam, we can see that language is at the top of the league table with the highest graduation rate in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language earn an A Plus grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students earned an A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish also earned an A grade.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that will certainly be required by children and adolescents in the future.
Today the languages, as a choice of subjects, are held in the same standard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Service in 2014 found that out of several reasons why employers should continue to struggle with filling out vacancies, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are important in a globalized world.
Whatever a person’s career choice, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will feel the real benefit of having this kind of lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of a foreign country will automatically make a multilingual excel in the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French became the only language spoken in two-digit percentages, which is 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for today’s children is important for today.
Having multilingual skills, especially the languages of countries with a growing economy, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the language that is considered the most important in English for the next few years, namely 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in an independent school, with teaching staff who are experts in this field.
Scotland’s independent schools are aimed at providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
It is undeniable that today, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should really be considered an "international communication skill."
The independent school will continue to offer these options, diversity, and excellence to Scottish teenagers.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play a few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to do pre-season matches to prepare,” he said.
Trump's General Meeting Schedule in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began the rush of tonight's campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at several fun venues covering Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was confirmed that the vote was delayed so he could vote for the Supreme Court nominee, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote is held in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia online through a live broadcast on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will discuss a hearing this week for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is increasingly tense after allegations of indecent sexual acts and a Senate vote forecast will be delayed by up to a week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main goal of the rally’s agenda is to help the Republican party to gain some momentum in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump’s campaign it was mentioned that the five rallies next week aim to “encourage the volunteers and supporters as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House,” according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so important to its agenda that the president will travel as much as possible to the states as we face a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally is expected to bring in supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as draw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate who was left behind in the polls.
"It's not a good omen for Morrisey so the president should come in as an effort to increase his gains in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows courage to defend its hopes in face of Sunday's single game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome session is what may be needed in this Ryder Cup.
Momentum pendulum swings are a concept of sports that are the result of findings that are entirely trusted by players, and there is nothing more than in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is right now?
"Previously, they were six points clear and now four, so I think we took it as a bit of momentum," said Jordan Spieth as the day passed.
Of course Europe has the advantage of being four points ahead with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, felt they had a little bit of momentum and they had a lot of things that could be spirited, no less than Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and boasted three out of four points each.
Spieth has played deadly from the tee area to the green area and led by example.
The rallying cry grew louder when the turn came, putting a crucial blow to make the series match as he and Thomas lost two to two.
Putting a punch from him that won them at number 15 greeted with a similar shout, a shout that tells you that he's confident America isn't losing.
"You really have to try harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
All of these players are gone now.
18 holes that need to be marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas for two days ago were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The unique but interesting pair from Europe is four to four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair to not hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seemed to flow both to and from this boisterous crowd convinced that they were the players to be defeated on Sunday, and no player more famous than neither Fleetwood nor Molinari would lock in a potential European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It is better if at the same time both are placed in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shortened the work of Sergio Garcia, a morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine are like digging a hole that this Spanish and Swedish golfer will never be able to climb.
Although, on Sunday no one can help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are great shows to take a closer look at because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how strategies can change instantly.
Europe played better as a team and led far enough towards the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the U.S. team had the guts to compete despite some doubt, especially in the United States.
Europe top 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will capitalize on the advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after rising from Saturday’s fourball and foursome game with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The duo inspired Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari to lead with two wins over Tiger Woods who have struggled to record their points so far at Le Golf National with four.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to retain the trophy he had not won at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American team in the morning fourball, making the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursome, winning two games, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debutant to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points from their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball they became very solid to beat the blistering Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a firmer 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who forced his way through two games on Saturday, occasionally performed brilliantly but he has already lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome as well as seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting on the morning fourball, then returned to pair up with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2<0x26>1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three worlds.
Europe does not reach it on its own despite a pleasant and windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for America by two points on Saturday.
They got an interesting 2<0x26>1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball then came back again to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4<0x26>3 in foursome after losing the first two holes.
Only twice has it occurred in Ryder Cup history where a team returned from a four-point deficit went into a single game, although as defending champions Furyk's team only needed series points to retain the trophy.
However, after being second best for two days, Sunday’s counterattack looked like it would surpass them.
North Korea says 'impossible' to unilaterally disarm without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister addressed the United Nations on sanctions that continually deepened their distrust of the United States and it was unlikely that the country would unilaterally disarm its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures showing goodwill” in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and pledging not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it would be impossible for us to disarm ourselves first unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "staged" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be punished for taking gradual steps, his significant statement delivered that they did not reject fully the way Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri was referring to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between U.S. presidential officials and the new North Korean leader this time held in Singapore on June 12, at which time Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea has wanted an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by imposing semi-sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and even rejects the "final declaration of war," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can get us to our knees is an illusion of people who don’t know about us.
But the problem is that those constant sanctions will deepen our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that highlighted US leaders at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party troubled in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not come to this kind of deadlock."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean rockets on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after Trump called Kim “a rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at a U.N. meeting, Trump who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, lavished praise on Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but the big work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter", he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must proceed unequivocally and must not fail until we know that denuclearization is full, final and verifiable."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had actually been progress, only that North Korea had within hours invaded that he was making “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
He stated that Kim told him to take "appropriate action" to his wishes was a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year put all high school students there to sleep more, in an effort to counter the macho culture of learning that is developing through caffeine-powered 'human owls'.
An academic finds that students at the world’s number one university often know nothing about discussing the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine specializing in sleep problems at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
She was inspired to start the course after giving lectures on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end a girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only being told now, in my final year?'
The girl said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, first launched this year, explains to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students who were severely sleep deprived throughout the week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there was a picture of a dormitory room, where students clicked on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation of the influence of caffeine and lights, as well as how athletic results were affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of bedtime routines.
In the other section, participants were briefed on how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know this is not going to change the student's behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health," Czeisler said.
Culture prides itself on ‘begadang’ still existing, he said, plus that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students which means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough sleep, with good quality, should be a ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain activate hunger mode, giving rise to a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California resident studying chemistry and physical biology who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire campus.
The next step, she hopes that all graduate students are instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommends that students should consider setting a sleep time alarm, also a wake alarm, and be aware of the effects of ‘blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its regulatory path causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals to bring Gerrard's team down mentally
Again, the Rangers felt the sadness of the away day as Dolly Menga's attack delivered a team of dispersed Steven Gerrard on a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox’s side are trying to record their first win on their way, since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s side have just given Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind leaders Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Attacking seven minutes before halftime was over and the exhausted Rangers players did not seem to keep up.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, just behind the goal difference from Hibernian.
And there could be further problems at Rangers after line keeper Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Instead, Holt went with the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would be delighted with the costumes that captivated their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of the ball they had.
They should have recorded the score within two minutes when Menga's first short pass was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder pulled the big opportunity too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick then met captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide in the back position.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than confidence about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have got a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided on a quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers only managed to make two pitches in the first half but the previous Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had almost never had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's easy-to-play attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be the opposite of the course of the match, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their own hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep dead ball tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm picking Menga after a simple finish.
Gerrard acted on the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change came close to having a direct impact as the winger put the ball on Morelos but Kelly's impressive play quickly got out of line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the away team to play the exact game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
Holt's team was supposed to widen their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood well to drive out Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty when he was at odds with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his head.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger Number
And now from the pages of our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and will ALWAYS BE AFFECTED... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device being referred to as the Geiger Numerator.
Being the mainstay of science since then, Geiger has also become the mainstay of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring the seemingly less convincing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Numbering, used to find the location of radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "Say, it must be popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But it was the discovery that kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to ‘recognize’ bad cells
New cancer vaccines teach the immune system to 'know' bad cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The method involves the process of extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory.
They can then 'recognize' proteins that are common in many cancers and then be injected again
An experimental vaccine showed promising results in patients with a wide range of cancers.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extracting the patient's immune cells, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "identify" the proteins commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting those cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Society in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "encourages the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
Similar approaches such as taking patients' immune cells and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells have been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West Begins Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wearing MAGA Hats, After His SNL Appearance.
Doesn't run well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he would run in 2020.
After performing a third song that night, titled Ghost Town where he wears a Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with a play starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding claims of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the upload.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble backstage due to the hat being worn.
"They beat me to the backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out wearing that hat.'
They're beating me up!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see a sinking place?" saying that he's going to wear Superman's robe, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do. You want the world forward?
Try to love."
His comments generated scorn at least twice from the audience and the SNL cast looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling: "The whole studio went silent."
West was brought in at the last moment as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, the former girlfriend of rapper Mac Miller who had just died a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of his song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West had the backing of TPUSA’s conservative group chairman Candace Turner who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR BUYING THE PEOPLE.”
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just “being himself and that’s really great.”
"But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe embraces and spews harmful ideologies for my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "a creature officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and certainly the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and later artist formerly known as Prince.

These charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for swinging the sword in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, refutes the macho hero stereotypes, saying that roles on such screens make teenage boys often feel that they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes ‘something is wrong’ and questioned how to deal with the problem of poor masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, said she felt "strong enough" to discuss the issue.
"I feel personally, quite strongly, right now - where is our fault in terms of this masculinity?," he said.
'What do we teach men as they grow up, about the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the emergence of poor masculinity with its highly masculine characters.
He continued: 'Which is the character from birth and what is taught?
What is being taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they have to have this particular side to be male?
I think it's really one of the big questions of the day - how do we change it?
There’s something wrong with young people.”
In the interview he also admitted that he will not play in the prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "done with a battlefield and a horse".
Since November Kit will star in the return of True West from Sam Shepard, which is a story about the film's producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers a meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to quit Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, thus giving me a family of the future, and from here my life begins."
Rose plays Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14<0x25> surge in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> jump in the number of its population living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of an infected blood transfusion.
However, the number of people living with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has increased to 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is on the rise.
Due to the country’s conservative value, studies estimate that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transmission of the disease comes from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that staff had leaked GOP senator data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
United States. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of her staff members had sent the personal information of three United States Republican senators to the Wikipedia page of MPs.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party asserted that the claim was moved by experts and the "ultra-right wing" website.
"Lies, lies, and many more lies are vile," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that the information released included the home address and telephone number of United States Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by an unidentified person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of indecent sexual treatment of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
This leak came shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was connected to Waters' office and divulged the information of one of Waters' staff members, Hill reported.
“These baseless allegations are completely false and are an absolute lie,” Waters said.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal information and safety are threatened as a result of deceptive and false allegations - have absolutely no responsibility for this information leakage.
This unfounded accusation is absolutely false and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This objection means anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows he is not fit to be a Member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something that doesn't do it, they shouldn't be angry.
They can't stray.
They cannot question the motives of the accused.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican party candidate who is trying to shift Waters at the midterm elections, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In its statement, Water said its office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities regarding these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the culprits will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their destructive and harmful actions for any and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - a parody of Rowan Atkinson's underrated spy
Currently seeking the significance of Brexit in every new film with a British bias view is already a tradition and that seems to apply to the resurgence of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcasm insinuate how clearly we are a new export opportunity for this country?
After all, that glaring, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has renewed his license to screw things up for a second time - his name hints more than anything that he is a vast comic creation designed for areas of language cinema other than English.
Surely he is a crazy secret agent who, despite his strange conjecture, has a bit of a Clouseau character, a tiny Mr Bean character and a tiny nomad who contributed a little note to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Indeed, he is indeed based on the international traveller and mystery man whom Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving the chaos behind him.
There were one or two sweet moments on this recent JE trip.
I love when Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing medieval armor and a rotor propeller quickly sticks to his helmet.
Atkinson's prize for physical comedy was featured, but his humor felt underpowered and too strange, especially when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible had confidence to include comedy as material.
His humor felt as if it was aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's various misadventures were strangely not as innovative and as focused on the jokes of Atkinson's film-brick in Bean's personality.
The premise being warm these years is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, uncovering the identities of all British agents on the ground, to disappoint the agent on duty - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This was the last chance for an arrogant and hostile prime minister, who had already completely shattered his political popularity: Emma Thompson played an excellent role with the quasi-Teresa-May character but there was not much to be worked on from his script.
His intelligent advisor gives the information that since every active spy has been weakened, he must take someone out of retirement.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English himself, now employed as principal in some luxury buildings, but gives a secret lesson on how to do undercover operations: there are some nice jokes here, when English offers a spy academy like the School of Rock.
English is returned to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunites with long-suffering old friend Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, electrifying a submarine commander, a shitty upper-class woman role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat eliminated.
So Batman and Robin, who made a mistake on His Majesty's Secret Agent, return to action, meet the mysterious beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is concerned about falling under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve the British computer problem: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their ridiculous adventure: posing as waiters, they burn down a French fast food restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves onto Volta's luxury ship; and English sparks anarchy when he tries to use Virtual Reality's headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
All stops are certainly drawn to the final sequence, but with such friendliness and turmoil, there are few children’s TV channels that contain it all.
That's a pretty moderate thing.
And like any other Johnny English film, I couldn’t help but think: couldn’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that was really appropriate for his talent?
Labour denied it was planning for Britons to work four days a week but was paid five days
Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that wants Britons to work four days a week – but get paid five days.
The union reportedly wants the company owners to continue the savings through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for workers by giving them extra days off.
He will let the employees enjoy a three-day weekend – but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea will 'pass' to the party's economic agenda and plans encourage the country to support the workers.
The transition to four days a week has been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A source, a senior from the Labour Union, told The Sunday Times: "A review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
"This is not going to happen overnight, but four working days a week is an aspiration that aligns with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy that supports the workers and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party had already promised four working days a week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at present the aspirations are not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: 'Four working days a week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labor conference last week to perfect his vision for a socialist revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from ‘anonymous directors' and ‘catchmakers' at utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plan also means that current shareholders in a drinking water company may not be able to regain their entire shares because the government of the Labour party can do a ‘reduction’ on the grounds of perceived violations.
He also ensured his plans to put workers on the company's board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to the employees, which would pocket annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised questions about whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find something that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy seems to be more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I would attend the trial, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the accusation came up, and said, 'You did it?'
He is strong, determined, determined.”
However, it seems that Graham's voice will not be able to be changed.
“My mind has already made a decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh, and it takes a bigger charge to change that,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but all I know is: Brett denied it out loud," Graham added, while referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone he mentioned his name couldn’t verify it.
He was 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has it Done Something to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive array of performing stars, and a memorable mission to end the world’s poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goals for the past 12 years?
Is the idea of giving gifts in the form of free concerts the right way to get people to do something, or is it just another case called “clicktivism” – people feel like they’re making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing to set other goals.
It said this action had helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion that would affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group had collected 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, at least <0x24>10 billion of which had been channeled or fundraising.
The group estimates that safe funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their maximum potential," promising to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make this social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told a crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions on their website asking "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: “It’s going to be a long and difficult road – sometimes we’re going to fall and fail.
However, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that have existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will get stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the stars performing at this year's event in New York, to be guided by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy as a "blockade" to impede Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could seek naval assistance to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspects that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, in its place of operation at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to be energy brokers, just like they do in eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that capability, with our Navy, to ensure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to conduct a blockade, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke before participants of the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of energy customers" in the US.
He compared the approach Washington made in the deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
"The economic choice in Iran and Russia is more or less, harnessing and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "experts in the field" with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as representatives of the Trump administration are on a mission to increase their exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, sought to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 oil refinery pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil refinery project, designed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denied that Washington's tough resistance to the project was solely driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be used as a tool for pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This US stance has drawn a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would face a big problem if a third country interfered with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “look at the situation” while running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "look at the situation" while running for president after a part-time election.
While campaigning at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren asserted he would consider running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our dilapidated government, including putting women at the top," she told The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take a closer look at the situation while running for president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning at a city hall, saying that he was "taking this region in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was outspoken in his criticism of Trump and future Supreme Court leader Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's own constituents do not want him running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said it was best for senators not to run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of running and 48 percent opposing him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed in connection with the likely run for office in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD Track Palin during Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in Sept.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he will be going through on his return, I can connect with other families who are also feeling the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are going through," he told the crowd at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "they came back a little differently, they came back a little harder, they came back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and the aviators and every other military member to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence offences against a woman, coupled with reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenges to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to the new U.S. policy of refusing asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner "and his son who is a ruthless gang member," had harassed him, but U.S. officials turned down his request for asylum on July 20.
He's under arrest in Texas.
State prosecutors in favor of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce asylum applicants in large numbers for the U.S., as countries facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy contrasts with a 2014 Immigrant Appeals Board decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "is ignoring state, federal, and international laws that have existed for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims should be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances relating to such claims, and such a ban violates the principle," the friend-of-the-court brief said.
Further prosecutors gave a brief opinion that policies that reject the influx of immigrants hurt the U.S. economy, saying that it is likely they will become entrepreneurs and “supply the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang atrocities.
"Asylums are available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, national, or membership issues in social groups, or certain political opinions," Sessions said in the policy announcement on June 11.
Asylums are not meant to alleviate all problems -- even though all problems are serious -- that people face on a daily basis around the world.
A very sad rescue effort in Palu as casualties multiply as it raced with time to find survivors
For those who survived, the situation was even more dire.
"It feels very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her demanding baby boy at a refugee centre in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very rare."
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up water-damaged items, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, the damage caused by the 7.5 magnitude quake, was deeply chaotic.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, lay outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to a strong aftershock.
His tears flowed as he recounted how he felt when the quake shook the fifth floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There is no time to save yourself.
I think I'm wedged in the rubble of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding his family were in the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, then went silent.
I don’t know how it is with my son.
May they be safe."
US ambassador accuses China of 'intimidating' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after China's official newspaper posted a four-page ad in a US daily calling the reciprocal gains of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid supplement China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, an allegation that China denies.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election, which marks what U.S. officials told Reuters, is a new phase in Washington’s ramping up campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently shackled in a escalating trade war, which has led them to raise tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote an opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubling down on that intimidation by running propaganda ads in our own free media."
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is leveraging the tradition of free speech and freedom of the press that is highly valued in America by posting paid advertisements on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in the stalls of street newspaper sellers here, in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and will not see the true reflections of the different opinions that the Chinese may have regarding China’s troubled economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent media turned down an offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warn, Republicans Keep Women Voters Ahead of Part-time Election With Kavanaugh Disaster
Due to a slew of prominent Republicans standing up and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault charges, analysts have warned that they will see counterattacks, especially from women, at the upcoming part-time elections.
Emotions over the matter are very high, and most Republicans are already on record indicating that they want to move forward on the vote.
That can’t be prevented,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake's late-minute push to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to ease anger at voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators chanted "November is near!" as they staged a demonstration in the Senate hallway as Republicans controlled the Justice Committee to continue to advance in Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will be off the list," non-party political analyst Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it could be even higher, particularly among female voters in suburban areas and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which detailed sexual harassment of him by the Supreme Court’s nominee, analysts advised of a backlash that would follow if Republicans continued to push him forward with confirmation.
"It's been a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee election or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how Republicans deal with this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to vote for Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans are likely to be split over who to trust after testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more favorable choice to the latter.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents actually believed or may believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they actually believed or may believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh may or actually lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said similar things about Ford.
After the encouragement from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that a drunken Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said the future Supreme Court chief had revealed his innocence to him when they attended a party while they were at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventors Plan to Start New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The tech legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company built from Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination."
“We have to start now,” he said from the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
This storage can contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about this personal online data storage is that it really is up to the user who can access what type of information.
In companies it is known as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea to establish Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to present the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Today the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a volunteer community of coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change where all of their business models will actually be reversed overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post in Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet as he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the neutrality of the network debate.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorating the WW1 scholar Victoria Cross
The only Church scholar in England to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior, is commemorated on his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a “symbol of intelligence” that would reveal exactly 100 years of achievement his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "penetrating a very thick fog under a barrage of fire from field guns and machines."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with the "greatest courage" led the front line before rushing using field weapons alone and disabling three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s action was “something I knew I wouldn’t be able to live but it was a very humble act.”
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "extremely honored to have played a part in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that will be given by many."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine this, you’ve stayed up all night to watch the overcrowded Bellator 206 just to be denied watching the main event.
The bill from San Jose contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being aired live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, audiences in England were stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they stay up until the early morning special for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to children's cartoons as "an annoying joke."
"It's a government rule, that at 6 a.m. the content is not suitable for airing, so it was replaced with a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they would improve their scheduling by taking into account future audiences in the UK.
"In my opinion, if we think about the replay, I think we might be able to get it done," Coker said.
"But right now it's there at six in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, at the time of the turn, there was a lot of text back and forth and all of it was not educational.
We’re trying to fix it, we think it’s just a technical mistake.
No, it's the government's problem.
Trust me, next time it won’t happen again.
We will reduce up to five bouts alone from six bouts – as we usually do – and we will try to avoid overplaying for fans, and we succeed.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘low’ about sexuality issues
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with low self-esteem due to his sexuality problems – but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize it until he entered high school, that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she talked about the right of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him not so concerned about winning the Olympics.
The show’s long-running host, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as the one who was eliminated on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "less compared" to everyone else she grew up with because "it's not a socially acceptable thing to like men and women."
He said: “To this day, that feeling of being less than others, and feeling differently, has become the real things that give me the power and strength to succeed.”
She wants to prove that she is "something," she says, so she won't disappoint everyone when they find out about her sexuality issues.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a well-known LGBT campaigner and used her performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to not discriminate against homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man — US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “shocking me.”
Daley was married to an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him last year, and said the age gap was not an issue.
"When you're having so many problems at a very young age" - he entered his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced the same ups and downs.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley saying "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's all about 'I have to win the gold medal'," he said.
“You know, there’s something bigger than winning an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had already got tickets for the 2012 London Olympics - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'you're not going to sit in the front row of dad'," he said.
“I held her hand when she stopped breathing and still didn’t really stop breathing until she died, finally I admitted that she was invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“All I know is, this is what I’ve dreamed of all my life – to dive in front of a crowd at the Olympic Games, there’s no better feeling than that,” he said.
It also inspired his choice of first song – Proud by Heather Small – which had already fused with him in his preparations for the Olympics and still made him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast broadcast on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson switched roles in Saturday's Ryder Cup
American golfer Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change roles to avoid unpleasant achievements.
Mickelson, who played in the biennial event to set a record for 12th time, was booked by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball and group game on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, this five-time major winner divides his time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on that range, in hopes of improving what has troubled him.
Never being the straightest golfer despite being at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old was unsuitable for a very tight course at Le Golf National, which routinely gave a long, rough penalty for every wrong shot.
And for his own pitch, it’s not scary enough for Mickelson, in his ninth game on Sunday, to face highly accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 single games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then Mickelson's game proves to be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understood his role today, patted me on the back and hugged me, and said he would be ready for tomorrow's game," Furyk said.
"He's so confident.
He is a Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagine the others, but that’s how it’s played and that’s the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy a different atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup game, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup which would never match his individual record height.
Mickelson bagged 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought some unsaid things to the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players are having fun with him, this week as well, which is quite fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from experience that someone who led big enough to his last single match in the Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant ride.
The Danes made their debut at the 1997 game in Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point lead over the Americans, but had just touched the finish line with their noses by the thinnest margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get a big lead at Valderrama; we get a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but just recently," said Bjorn, taking the picture, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5–3 both on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will enter a really boring game.
Go out and do all the right things.
It’s not over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win this trophy, and that’s the focus.
I’ve said for a long time, I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also very aware of what’s on the other side – the greatest players in the world.”
Glad to see the players playing on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "In this case I will never progress on my own.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will advance, and this is a different thing to do.
It’s nice to be out there with a colleague when things are going well, but if you’re out there playing individually, then your full ability as a golfer will be tested.
That’s the message you have to deliver to all the players, getting the best out of yourself for tomorrow’s game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his players to play better individually than they did as a pair, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both ends of the last day of the big game, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending in defeat as Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina."
“I remember every single word of it,” he replied to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together towards the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast as you see at Brookline, as you see at Medina.
When the momentum goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in different ways that we feel, you know, we are trying to do a miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the resistance against Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players being top of the table.
"I went with this group of people in this order because I think I can close all the roads," Bjorn said of his single choice.
New German warship suspended
The latest German Navy escort ship was supposed to have started duty in 2014 to replace an aging Cold War-era warship, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The assignment of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class escort ship, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy had already ordered in 2007 would come in place of the aging Bremen-class escort ships.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as several stealth technologies, such as radar erasers, infrared, and acoustic locks.
Other important features include a longer period of maintenance - it should be possible to use the latest escort ship for two years away from its home port.
However, the constant delay meant that this advanced warship – which was said to allow Germany to highlight its power abroad – would be worn out by the time it began to enter service, Die Zeit noted.
The F125's ill-fated escort ship became news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to shipbuilders after delivery.
Few reasons are known behind the ship's return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship useless if used for combat missions.
Software defects were crucial because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on the older Bremen-class battleships.
It was also found that the ship's weight was excessive which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as a German-class ship used in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the production costs of the entire project - including crew training - were also a problem.
It said it rose surprisingly to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) - up from its initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The issue with the new guard ship has become particularly important in light of the latest warnings as there has been a shrinkage in the German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of Germany's parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "out of ships with the ability to deploy."
The official said over time the issue has grown, as the old ships are no longer in use but no replacement ships have yet been provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class escort ships could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of the bat in secret
New research is being done on a plantation in the Scottish Highlands that aims to uncover the way bats use landscapes in their food hunts.
It is hoped that these findings will shed new light on the unique behaviour of flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common pipistrelle and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The sound specialist who analyzes all the recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and which species are doing what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be created to create images with scaled landscapes detailing their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes these results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits are gained from habitat management work such as grassland creation and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout England has declined sharply in recent centuries.
These bats are threatened by developmental and developmental work affecting the nest and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper suspended to trap bats as well as chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
The bat is not blind.
However, due to his hunting habits at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes in terms of catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo location techniques to find insects appropriately and barriers in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, cares deeply about bats.
It has ten trained experts, who routinely conduct surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organisation has also established the first and only nature reserve in Scotland at the Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
Farm manager David Thompson said the estate was a suitable area for bats.
"Here at Threave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, a lot of old trees, and all the good habitat.
However, there are still a lot of things we don't know about bats, so, the work we do here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of screening bats before performing maintenance within the property, as unwittingly there is the possibility that the destruction of one maternity nest could kill up to 400 female and young bats, which may wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, harassing, or disturbing, or destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the general public to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species that we don’t yet know what the fate of their populations is.”
Ronaldo, who denies claims of rape, is preparing a lawyer to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claims against him "fake news," and said that people "wanted to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which publicizes the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her by giving <0x24>375,000 to keep quiet about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live Broadcast video to his 142 million followers hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no.
All they said today was fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for calling my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they called “a report of suspicion in the field of privacy that is unacceptable,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said it would seek compensation as "a moral compensation in an amount appropriate to the gravity of the breach, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to a report filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo was on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who was disappointingly only "one percent."
The documents say that Ronaldo justified that they both had sex, but that was on the basis of mutual desire.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and had done a visum of her injuries in hospital, but later agreed to settle the matter out of court because she felt "fear of getting revenge" and feared "would be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old said she is now seeking to cancel the peace settlement because she is constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ over loss of automakers
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added "about" Toyota, the UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal, it will temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the border delay if no deal is reached would be detrimental to Brexit in terms of job costs.
The factory in Burnaston – which makes Auris and Avensis Toyota production – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90<0x25> were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will see a halt in production at our plant," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other British automakers have expressed their concerns about exiting the European Union without an agreement on how cross-border trade will run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem associated with what the automakers are saying is the risk of a supply chain if there is no deal with Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on the principle of “on time” production, with spare parts coming in every 37 minutes from both suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there may be disruption at the border, which industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies for more than a day at its plant in Derbyshire, the company's representative said, and thus production would be halted.
Clark said Chequers' plans for future relations with the European Union were "calibrated appropriately to avoid border checks."
"We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I'm saying not only to enjoy success at the moment, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The proof is not just from Toyota alone but other manufacturers as well, that we really need to be able to continue what is already a very good supply chain.”
Toyota could not say how long its production would be halted, but it was clear in the long run, warning that adding costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and would ultimately be detrimental in terms of job costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is Unite's union manager at the factory, said its members have become increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once this job is gone, it will never come back again.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a proper and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be “scheduled back in a week” as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in elections, relations between Trump’s aides and Russia, as well as potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has sparked rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose no" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was again postponed to avoid a clash with a Senate judicial committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting has not yet been set, so maybe in this week, I can see that resuming it to another week is good also given the other things that happen in the supreme court.
But let's see and I always want to deliver the latest news to the press."
Some journalists will oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the rarity of meetings was not due to a dislike of TV reporters "who are trying to attract attention," though, he said: "I don't agree with the fact that they are trying to attract attention."
Then he proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be enhanced.
"The president is doing more direct question-and-answer sessions than the previous president," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We’ve tried to do it more often and you’ve seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump routinely asks questions while leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting top officials.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably show why, performing free and sometimes bizarre performances before reporters gather.
Health secretary writes letter to EU workers in Scotland's NHS on concerns over Brexit issue
The Secretary of Health has written a letter to EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and hope they will still be working here after the Brexit issue.
MSP’s Jeane Freeman sent a letter in less than six months until Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to meet the cost of filing fixed status for EU citizens working in the transferred public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on this withdrawal are still ongoing, close to the decision expected this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for a possible scenario of the absence of a deal.
I know this must be very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I now want to reiterate how much I value the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from across the European Union, and others, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and enhance healthcare work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennesse reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the round ended.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell unconscious there," Reed said.
The coach and medical personnel oxygenated Abercrombie on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further evaluation.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was already out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there have been no details on the type/level of injury experienced" and the State of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this red-shirted second-rate student, was in his first season with the State of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He earned a total of five tackles on Saturday before being out of the game, which made his total tackles during the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamping fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamping fee when they purchase a property in the UK, along with additional money that will be used to help the homeless as per the new Tory plan.
This move will hold back the pace of the success of the Corbyn movement in attracting young voters
The increase in the cost of this stamp will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Finance Department estimates it will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year- to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - along with additional money to be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to stifle the success rate of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts in attracting young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and target high incomes.
The increase in stamping fees will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, along with additional money that drives the Government’s efforts to combat vagrants.
Additional costs – which are additional costs on current stamping fees, including higher levels introduced two years ago on second home purchases and home purchases for rent – could reach three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of the newly built property in London was purchased by non-English residents, which led to a rise in prices and made it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many of the rich areas of the country - usually in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a week after Boris Johnson called for a cut in seal costs to help more young people own their first homes.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to ignore quotas for affordable homes to fix the UK’s “habit”.
Corbyn has announced a series of proposals for reforms in the field of attractive housing, including the supervision of rents and ending the eviction "without guilt".
He also wanted to give the council more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I promised I would dedicate the prime ministership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our dilapidated housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to buy homes as easily as the UK residents who are already working hard.
For many people the dream of owning a home becomes something very far away, and the indecent treatment of the homeless remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scotland team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "main ambition" was to become Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scot, enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently ranked third in League One, a three-point gap from the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to defend my country as a player.
I got the B hat and that's it," Ross told Sportound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often watched the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it was always something that drew me back.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland's managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he did not feel intimidated following in the footsteps of big names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the current success will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
"Because of the structure and facilities that exist at this club, there is no doubt about being in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to be there, but I would probably just see myself as a successful person here, if I could bring this club back there.
Ross's career in team management was only three years, after some time as assistant boss at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coaching staff at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to third, and converted St Mirren from a relegation gap to a Championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he has ever done during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably the crossroads I had to go through," he recalled as he took over Alloa.
"I really believe management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I’m doing well, making a living in a reasonable way, and enjoying some reasonable things.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still experience it in terms of job pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I’ve always wanted to lead something and now I’m doing it, the most comfortable feeling I’ve ever felt in my entire adult life.”

The survey found that the right time to drink beer was 17:30 on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted the income of pubs in Britain that are struggling to survive, but put more pressure on the restaurant network.
Figures show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July — but restaurant revenue fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant, who compiled the figures, said: "The scorching sun and England's participation in the World Cup longer than expected means, July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where pub revenue increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that got a hard hit.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade in June will get worse in July.
Sales of pubs and bars selling drinks have so far performed most strongly than those of restaurants that went down.
Pubs that sell food are also suffering from the heat of the sun, though not as severe as restaurant operators.
Looks like people are just out for a drink.
Sales across managed pubs and bars selling drinks rose 6.6 percent for the month, with those selling food down three percent."
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors that concern the sales of the market outside the home.
It’s no surprise that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales would be particularly painful on top of the ongoing cost pressures.
A long summer shouldn’t come at a time when operators selling food are having bad times, and time will tell whether the good enough temperatures we’ve already enjoyed in August will give us the little break we need.”
Total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, showing a slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitors for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors in the UK collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an industry benchmark that is undeniable.

Survey of 20,000 high school students reveals development of "Fake Insta" page
This news has raised fears of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "primary" account to show parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — create social media accounts that they keep from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid development of a "Fake Insta" account - a reference to a photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has raised fears of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they operated a cleaned up “primary” account to show parents, while also having a personal account.
A mother who discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who asked others to "rape me."
Research conducted by the UK Digital Awareness and the Conference of Male Principals" as well as Female Principals" (HMC) from independent schools, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep a personal account.
Head of HMC, Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing so many teenagers who are trying to create an online space that their parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletic Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most widely-marked track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie describes the move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from his various experiences at international level over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England and the world's athletic community and we are confident athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for the athletes and I look forward to really contributing and helping lead the sport in Scotland."
The American athlete, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter sprint at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among his four Olympic gold medals total and is now a BBC expert, is now unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “Today a month ago I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time can tell if I can recover and to what extent.
It’s a very tiring job to fully recover, relearn how to walk, and today do agility exercises!
Thanks for the encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ads comparing mothers to cows have divided opinion in the online world
Breast pump companies have divided opinion in the online world with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "the world's first silent wearable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a humorous music video to show the freedom this new pump gives to express a mother.
Four moms dancing in a barn filled with cow straw followed a song that included lyrics like this: "Yes, I'm blushing myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you don't notice it's not a fist, it's my breast."
Continued with the refrain: "Pump out, pump out, I feed them dear, pump out, pump out, I milk my woman."
However, the ads that have been published on the company’s Facebook page, have caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it is making a "horror" in the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless the baby is stolen from them within a few days of giving birth.”

Another comment: "A understandable trauma for both mother and baby.
But yes why not use it to advertise breast pumps for the mother who has to look after her baby?"
Another added: "An ad that lost meaning."
Others defended the ad, with a woman admitting that she found the song "funny."
“I think it’s a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still breastfeeding.
Peeling makes me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad was a little crazy but I accepted it as it was.
It's a genius product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who squeeze (often at their work or toilet) and who feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that compliments or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all feel dancing with a hidden pump tucked inside their bra.
The basis of this campaign concept comes from the insights of many breastfeeding women who say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes and fits inside the nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while squeezing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is a pioneering product worth launching convincingly and provocatively.
By equating the image between expressing women and dairy cows we want to pump breast milk and all the obstacles of the challenge, and show it in a fun and entertaining way with the full freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
In the London Fashion Week show, a mother with two children performed on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Move Silently to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained is on the rise as monthly border crossings remain unchanged, partly as a result of harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that complicate fostering children with sponsorship.
Essentially, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and fear endangering their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to save children.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor displaced minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of sponsor societies are in this country illegally, and most of them are bad strangers.
That’s why we continue to hunt those people,” Mr. Albence said.
Aiming to process children faster, officials introduced a new rule requiring some of them to appear in court within a month after being detained, not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, shelter workers said.
Most of them appear through video conference calls, not directly, to apply their legal status case to immigration judges.
Those who are deemed unfit to get help will be immediately deported.
The longer children are held, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape attempts, shelter workers said and system reports received in recent months.
Lawyers say the concern is heightened in larger facilities such as Tornillo, whose signs are in a struggling child tend to be ignored, due to its size.
They say that moving children to a camp town without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or saying goodbye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma that many have struggled with.
Syria calls on ‘occupying forces’ from the US, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country’s war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces occupied Syrian soil illegally, on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw as soon as possible and without making any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem asserted that the "war on terror is nearing completion" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than millions fleeing their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to “fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory” of the terror group and “the presence of illegal foreign troops.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, particularly training and influencing Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stressed that they should return soon, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading tremendous fear" that pushed the refugees further away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a full-fledged humanitarian problem.”
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction assistance for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has resulted in an opportunity to resume political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive offensive from Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where there are three million people living.
But Moualem asserted that the agreement had a "clear deadline" and raised hopes that military action would target mujahideen including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which "will be crushed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to create a post-war Act for Syria and pave the way to elections.
Moualem laid out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, insisting that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the articles of the current Act," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to the logic, Trump will win the general election again in 2020 unless, as many liberals expect, prosecution and scandal to end his presidency early.
There is no doubt, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
To date, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primetime viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the cable TV rankings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the main news night.
"It's a passion that draws people because it's something that's not yet understood," said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol's devastating attack.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
He recalled taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he would give Trump his vote.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There's a lot of entertainment in a mess.
Certainly, unlike other TV shows, the storyline that emerged from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families could reunite and restore the global economy.
Moving on from that, the luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
Even so, it’s not just being a knowledgeable citizen at six o’clock that you find yourself watching a panel of experts debate the use of Bob Woodward’s “background” source for his book “Fear,” wearing Paul Manafort’s <0x24>15,000 ostrich leather bomber jacket (“thick clothes with pride,” The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’ gruesome description of an ana.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of the policy he does makes it just like a reality show that entertains you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s daily show and storyline players (choose hostile to the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

A lot of money from outside is flooding into the fiercest part-time election competition in the White House
Naturally Pennsylvania 17 gained a flood of money, thanks to a reorganization of congressional districts that featured two incumbents in the same seat.
The recently reorganised district of Pittsburg, filed Conor Lamb of the Democratic Rep. - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb advanced against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old district of Pennsylvania 12, which overlaps with the new district of Pennsylvania 17.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts unconstitutionally sided with the Republican party.
Competition in Pennsylvania's new district of 17 has resulted in a large amount of campaign funds between the financial side of the major party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a slim victory in the March special election that was monitored publicly for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been occupied by Republican officials for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians are bringing the Democratic party a little bit superior.
U.S. Considers Giving El Salvador Penalty for Supporting China, Withdrawal
Diplomats confirmed that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognized Beijing, putting little pressure on Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a department spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But punishment was only considered against El Salvador, which had received about <0x24>140 million in aid from the Americans in 2017, including for narcotics control, development support and the economy.
The proposed penalties, which include cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt the Central American country and rising unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings took place, North and Central American officials delayed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on the same meeting last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to continue, in order to effectively end sentencing considerations for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of imports the government made at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys secretly returned again to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing a new rebuke or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate presented by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by outside analysts close to the government and also spoke of these unclear circumstances.
Study Story
Another shocking story is the report of special counsel Robert Mueller about the possible obstruction of justice of Mr Trump, for which there is currently very important evidence in the public record.
Mr Mueller’s report also discusses his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable from himself, just as he prepares to leave again in front of the voters, and may eventually become a juror of his partners.
That's why there's still a lot to do, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's administration is inevitable - or its equality in Europe.
There are choices we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West were against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed opportunities in avoiding the years of slaughter that followed.
The beginnings of history centered along such a point of aberration, and accelerated or delayed democratic marches were inevitable.
Americans are facing some of these changes.
What should we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since the paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and argued that he was unfit to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account was not true.
“How do we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s new FBI investigation is incomplete or fair – or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite strong allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to vote at half-time for Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail that test, democracy will get worse in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with a swastika.
By leaving that legacy to me, how can I lose hope about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans feeling optimistic ahead of match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, armed with a victory over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury left midfielder Graham Dorrans unable to perform in his first season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to a bigger goal.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal are a great team," the 31-year-old said.
"In this game we believe we can get something and go with a point.
In the end, we might be able to do it but, in our opinion, a draw might be a fair result.
In the first half, they might have performed better but in the second half, we got up and became a better team.
Going up on Thursday, tonight is another big European day.
We hope to bag three points even though it will be a difficult game because they have had a good result in their last game, but, with the support of the fans behind us, I believe we can go ahead and get a positive result.
Last year we had a difficult time, because of my injury and the change at the club itself but at the moment there is very good hope at this club.
The squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's a good exercise.
Hopefully now we can improve, put the past behind us and achieve success.”

Although it turned out that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people discussed it with their family members.
Approximately half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their partners.
Only 10 percent of them said they discussed this with their children.
“They want family members to provide care, but there is no step to start the discussion,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
This is where it's time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your own family for treatment if you don’t tell them what you want.
Discuss with your counselor and your family, where and how you get treatment, because the one you choose will be very important in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can certainly give you his or her help in showing you how to pay those costs.
The financing you choose for long-term care includes a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or insures yourself with your wealth – as long as you have the money.
Show your valid documents: Face the legal debate that is going on.
Appoint immediate powers for your health care, i.e. someone you trust to ensure your health care and guarantee if your wishes are carried out by people who are professional when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, the power of attorney in terms of your finances should also be considered.
Someone who is trusted to take care of all your financial decisions should you choose, in addition to making sure your bill payment in case you can’t afford it.
Always remember with every little detail: Just imagine when your elderly parents are in an emergency and on their way to the hospital.
Do you have any questions about medication or allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to answer.

A man was shot by a wind rifle in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot with a wind gun on his way home from a night party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when multiple shots hit his chest, stomach, and hands.
The shooting event was described by officers as occurring around 2:30 BST, and was said to be a "random act."
The victim did not see who attacked him.
The injuries suffered by the victim were not life-threatening and a number of witnesses have been filed by police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis hit Indonesia
A devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, killing at least 384 people, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The loss of communication made it difficult for rescue workers to get information from Donggala County, an area north of the town of Palu that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are some key facts about the city of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the narrow tip of the bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a regency of more than 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which is an administrative region under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The mainstay of the economy in South Sulawesi province is fishing and growing crops, especially on the coast of Donggala.
However, the presence of nickel mining plays an important role in the province, although most of it is centered in Morowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
In the past 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis, based on data from Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in the tsunami and hundreds of homes in Donggala collapsed.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami in western Donggala.
Seismicly, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and therefore earthquakes will occur regularly.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have hit in recent years are as follows:
2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a major earthquake, just off the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, to the point of killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of the death toll was in Aceh.
2005: Late March and early April, a series of also powerful earthquakes have hit the west coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami on the southern coast and leaving nearly 700 people dead.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
The death toll was more than 1,100.
2010: One of the islands in the Mentawai archipelago, off Sumatra, was also hit by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that instantly devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The district of Pidie Jaya, Aceh, also suffered a shallow earthquake and caused destruction, as well as panic from people who are remembered for the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
Although there was no tsunami this time, more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Lombok, dubbed a tourist island, also suffered a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily laid off thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on the pretext of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest attempts, as the Alaska State Police report released on Saturday.
According to police reports, when an acquaintance of the woman tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she grabbed the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over to the Mat-Su Pretrial Prisoner, with an unsecured <0x24>500 fine, as reported by KTUU.
As the news network reported, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, as sure as possible" when asked about his defence.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could put him in jail for one year and a fine of <0x24>250,000.
In addition, he was also charged with Class B criminal charges, with a one-day jail sentence and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
For Palin, the criminal charge is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, contacted police to make a report on the alleged assault.
The case is currently being filed with the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was prosecuted for domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence crimes, and possession of a firearm in a drunken state, which was also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin came under fire from a veteran group for associating her son with PTSD as a result of her stint in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a massive earthquake and killed at least 384 people.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale that could have triggered a tsunami has devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity networks and communication links have been cut, and the death toll is expected to continue to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake hit central Sulawesi, located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing how terrible the moment of the disaster was circulating widely through social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke up the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for terror attack suspects in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack in New York City, in which eight people were killed -- a rare and unprecedented federal crime-related sentence since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly committed an assault by crashing a truck he rented from Home Depot into pedestrians and cyclists on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors had to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, based on a statement of will to impose the death penalty, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Based on court documents, both charges allow for the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of manslaughter in a racketeering, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violent acts and attempted motor vehicle destruction.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "substantial planning and early maturation," as a portrayal of Saipov's crimes committed with "heinous, cruel, and savage."
It was expressed in a statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has resulted in injury, harm, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims in the incident were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last imposed the death penalty.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, the accused of the murder of two drug suppliers, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The execution of the death penalty was last in New York federal court in 1953, handed down on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple found guilty in a espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse as the days and months after the attack went by.
When asked by investigators, he said he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov also told authorities that the attack was inspired by a video of ISIS being watched from his phone, as was the indictment.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges laid against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, expressed "clearly disappointed" at the prosecutor's decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to execute dead rather than receive a guilty plea for life imprisonment without bail will only extend the trauma of those involved in the incident," Patton said.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had pleaded with prosecutors not to sentence him to death.
NIGEL FARAGE is in charge of Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for 'moving the people's army' today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics – because one of the lawmakers, Theresa May, suggested taking part in negotiations with the EU.
Supporters of the conservative group, Peter Bone, told a street stunt in Birmingham that Britain "should be out" at the moment if only Farage served as Brexit Secretary.
Nevertheless, the challenges May faces in reconciling her divided position have been underlined by Remain Tories supporters who joined in separate protests denouncing Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise plan on track despite the Brexiteers, Remainers and EU attacks.
The allies stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach a deal with Brussels, despite a bad backlash - and forced Eurosceptics and Labor to make a choice between its proposed package and the 'trouble'.
Bone told the crowd Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to 'get rid of the Chequers.
His proposal, that Farage should appoint a colleague to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If the insurer stays with him, we'll be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MPs tweeted: “I am ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers.”
He said, pointing out his opposition to the European Union: "We are not fighting a world war to be submissive.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.'
Bone dismissed the proposal that public opinion has the potential to bring about change since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the thinking of the British people has changed and wants a fixed condition, is simply not true."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the mass action, told reporters: 'Simple, I want to say: O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular among the general public, while the Opposition will not vote for him, because it is not popular with our party and activists who are really taking to the streets and getting us elected in the first place.
Our plea, get rid of the Chequers and start listening to us.”
In a message addressed to May, she added: "The Prime Minister keeps their job when their promises are fulfilled."
Farage said that politicians' demonstrations must be staged in order to "feel the heat" if they want to renege on the 2016 referendum.
“Right now the most valuable thing is the trust between us – the people – and our political groups,” he said.
"They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, asserting to them that 'we will not allow you to do that'.
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to make our political group, which is preparing to reject Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are moving the people of this country who will win us in Brexit and will never give up until a self-governing, self-governing and proud United Kingdom is established."
Meanwhile, the Remainers mob moved through Birmingham before staging an action in the city centre for two hours.
Activist lines appear to be waving the Tories Against Brexit banner after sparking a row this weekend.
Labour co-defendant Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives over the security of their party’s application when the conference opened.
"It is these people who tell us that they can master the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the sake of an anti-impact border, in the face of unrestricted free trade in Ireland," he added.
“It’s really a funny show.
There’s no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren plans to do 'serious braking' in presidential run-off
United States. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "crash the presidential nomination" after the election moment in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic party declared its future at a city hall in western Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly denounces President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, Trump’s vice-chairman of the 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was already marked as an opponent of Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, held in the format of the city hall since Trump took office.
A contestant asked him if there were any plans to run for president.
Warren replied, "It's time for women to step into the Washington circle to restore our broken government, and that includes women to the top."
Arrest of Sims shooter, LSU player
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced the arrest of the suspected shooter leading to the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. in an ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, in which a man was identified asking for help as seen in the footage.
On Friday morning, 20-year-old Sims was shot and found dead near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde wanted to protect his friend and Simpson opened fire on him.
During questioning, Simpson confessed to being at the scene of the crime, holding a firearm, and firing it at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any meaningful resistance and thrown into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player 6 feet 6 inches tall, growing up in Baton Rouge, that's the figure of Sims, has played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 ball bounces in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team admits victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear by the time Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in Saturday’s qualifying run that would bring the Mercedes team’s order to have a big role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton as he maintained his position in the first two turns and pulled Vettel to attack his team-mates.
Vettel became the first to go into the pits and let Hamilton move into the density at the end of the crowd, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap after and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton kept going after a few chases that showed the Ferrari driver's reluctance to leave the inside blank with the risk of holding on after a double move to hold on in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started at the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead on most races as he held back the tyre turn to target a quick finish and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth.
He eventually got into the pit on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen eventually took fourth.
It was a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me.
The team has done an incredible job of having one or two," said Hamilton.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday through her insistence she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford regarding allegations of sexual assault against future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement delivered by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on what was going on in the senate that showed people who were "evil and perverted and dishonest."
“Something that can happen and the wonderful things that have been going on over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see the angry and evil and perverted and dishonest people,” he said.
"When you see the spills and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you divulge the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't divulge it."
All right, wait a minute.
What we divulged...No, we didn't divulge it," he added, as the senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and that had been leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak did not come from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t divulge the story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as secret as he asked."
But his refusal seemed to be disapproved by the president, who commented during a rally on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you, that’s really bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual abuse of three women, the president was impressed that Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power in various ways.
You see evil, malice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk to gain power and control," Mediaite reported on the president's speech.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 home game on Saturday.
The Giants got a two-goal lead after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side balanced before Dwyer returned the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season suffered by Adam Keefe's men, who managed to catch up and eventually outscored Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants' three wins in the previous game.
The opener from Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 of a pass given by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the pass when Beauvillier managed to double the lead four minutes later.
In the solid opening period, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the feeder for the balance that Cownie did at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead in the first half time when it flicked his second of the night goal late in the first period.
The hosts were reunited and Bouchard once again balanced their position with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time at the end of the second period and he ensured victory with his team in the middle of the fifth over the final period.
The Giants, who to date have suffered four defeats from their five games, are at home to face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Driver Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers on Plane Survive Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic guide has been hailed as a hero after his death while ensuring the plane carrying hundreds of passengers can fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake struck the Sulawesi islands on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to shake the region and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their safety, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a violently shaken guide tower at Palu’s Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport.
He opted to stay behind to ensure Batik Air Flight 6321, which at the time was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic guide tower as he felt the tower was beginning to collapse.
He died afterwards in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for the Indonesian Aviation Navigation Service, said his decision could save hundreds of lives.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter managed to reach Palu.
"We are all saddened to hear this," he added.
Authorities feared the death toll could reach thousands after the National Disaster Management Agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was difficult.
"The casualties are believed to continue to grow as many of the victims' bodies are still overgrown with rubble and many others are unreachable," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency.
Waves that reach six meters have made Palu muddy which led to a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and a variety of supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries a corpse.
Clean water is rare.
Minimarkets everywhere looted"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It has been a tragedy, but it may get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was also hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says one person missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operated a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia saying one person had disappeared, having previously been delivered to 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it was unable to identify a male passenger.
The airline said it had been working with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew members after the plane hit water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said the remaining six passengers were in hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the complete sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon around the runway.
Some witnesses felt the plane overran the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's really a good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-high water through the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He delivered the flight attendants panicking and screaming, and he suffered slight head injuries.
The U.S. navy said fishermen working close around the repaired docks also helped rescue using rubber boats to transport people ashore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) deep in the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents over the past two decades but none have involved Air Niugini.
Analysts shed light on women's nighttime timelines burned alive
The prosecution of the incarceration of the case took place on Saturday in a re-examination of a man accused of arson alive of a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made an outline for the judges on how he used cell phone footage to collect the various moves that 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, made on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis being in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, as opposed to the defendant's earlier statement, Clarion Ledger said.
When data showed the accused's cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford attended the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in the city on the day of the incident.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency conveyed by Tellis was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate they knew each other within a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis sometimes deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He removed the victim from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would lead to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of hip hop trios wanted to challenge the genre's negative outlook by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who hails from Bristol, claims the hip hop movement is moving away from the origins of the political message and rambling on social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop spirit popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK through several artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
NY nanny sues partner for assault after issuing "racialist" message
A New York nanny sues one partner for having attacked discriminatoryly after receiving an indirect message from a complaining mother and stating that she is "another black person."
The couple rejected that they were considered racist, and considered it more like "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, showed concern when she realized that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
“THERE’S NO BLACK PEOPLE,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
After all, instead of sending it to her husband, she instead sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that they took out a nanny, who is a mixed African-American, for doing an ugly job and she was expecting more Filipinos, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home using Uber.
Currently, Maurice is demanding the couple compensate for the dismissal, and is asking for a compensation of around <0x24>350 a day for a six-month period, in exchange for the caregiver's work he initially had to work on, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that," he told the Post on Sunday, then added "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple went against claims that they were racists, saying the worker Maurice fired was a reasonable thing to do, they feared they could not believe him after offending him.
“My wife has sent me something she didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
“But can you allow your children to be cared for by someone you’ve abused, even if it’s just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As it was wrapped in "extortion," Plasco said his wife had just two months to give birth to her baby and was in "a very difficult situation."
“You’re going after someone who’s in such a condition?
That's not a good thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still going on, the public opinion court has made a quick denunciation of the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
Paddington publishers worry readers won't be in touch with talking bears, new newspaper reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born not long after her book had been received, was described in the letter. "It's very difficult to just talk without knowing the position she was in, reading it first before it was published.
It's funny knowing as we know about Paddington's great success."
Said his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through the writing of a child's book with a bear toy, who was very optimistic about his rejected work, he added the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweetly bittersweet" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father was quite proud of his end of his success.
"He's a pretty quiet person, and he's not an arrogant person," he said.
“But because Paddington means so much to him, it’s like you have a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of them even though it’s not all your effort.
I think he sees Paddington's success that way.
Although it was a result of his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her over the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but doctors failed to save her.
"Nad made a calm call to say it was so bad that he probably wouldn't survive," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying he would die within the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Medications that doctors have given to keep his heart beating slowly gradually deplete and leave his system.
He had died a few times while the handling process was going on and everything felt deadly.
I can only sit there and wait, understanding all this has been revealed.
I couldn’t groan, or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to endure it all."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - unaware of what she had been through.
“No one knows,” he said.
"My head was bowed lethargic and my tears kept dripping all the time.
It was very difficult to explain, but during that flight I felt a deep sympathy for Nad.
That she needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
The grieving women posted a card to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones are trying to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and contactable numbers for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when she began suffering from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, age 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that his smile brightens the atmosphere.”
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried if there will be a sustained effect."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to let people know that there's someone else out there who you can approach and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit back and shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who was friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he was feeling sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a major trauma for them, but they had to go through it: "It created a gap in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future was in uncertainty when the FBI began its investigation
“I think, if we really get something like what he’s asking for – a time-restricted, time-restricted investigation – we might be able to bring a little unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be “crushed” amid a stalemate of the board’s ruling.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is all due to time.
The legislative election remains five weeks away, on November 6th - if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, they will become very weak in its chances of getting the person they want elected to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush had contacted the Senators, lobbying them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be an election in the Senate, in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It remains unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes among the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors ‘fall’ under Kim
The number of people defecting from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by people smugglers were a key factor.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
Most defectors from the North were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in the war - have greatly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on pending denuclearization negotiations.
This comes after a historic meeting in June between US president Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress since.
"Without confidence in the United States, there would be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, it would be impossible for us to drop our weapons unilaterally," Mr Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical," saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Opposition Party chairman Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said she was not a temperamental fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid the thought that if a woman performs like that, they will say 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that she had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In her opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost screaming and had trouble speaking when discussing her family and her years during high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, saying the charges against him were "unreasonable and coordinated character assassinations" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she could not serve on the Supreme Court because she was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats.”
Pelosi expressed objections if he would try to indict if he was approved, and if Democrats get more votes in the House of Representatives.
"I would say something like this -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he as a Democrat he was concerned about the potential of Kavanaugh's ruling against the Health Services Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as a conservative justiceist.
In the appointment hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for someone who is hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
It was an ethical abuse, a rage for months and years, and he couldn't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry: Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you think?"
He continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started to cry, she would say to the person who was talking to her, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then he continued.
And I think that's brilliant."
Tears were issued as a way out of anger partly because he was essentially misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of early work, in a male-dominated office, one time I cried with unexpressed anger, was that my neck was gripped by an older woman – a cold manager whom I always had a little fear of – who dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they made it."
Patricia Schroeder, who is a congressman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, bitterly frustrated, understood that there was no reason for herself not to run for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," he told me with a laugh 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called her "The Snow Princess and the Seven Dwarfs."
As it was too late in the campaign, he was left behind in the fundraiser, and so he vowed he would not contest the election unless he managed to raise 2 million dollars.
It was a fight that led to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to the man only gave him <0x24>250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
As he made a speech announcing that he was not going to launch a formal campaign, he was too overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported him, frustration with a system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism – making it difficult to talk.
"You'd probably think I was too nervous," Miss Schroeder recalled of how the press reacted to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my gravestone?
"He was crying?"
How U.S.-China trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening shots of the trade rivalry between the U.S. and China are so deafening, and while the fight is far from over, the rift between the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese exports including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
A very significant increase was imposed starting this week with new tariffs affecting goods worth <0x24>200 billion dollars (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively imposing a tax on half of all goods entering the U.S. through China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, recently imposing tariffs to five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pleaded to equal the U.S. one-by-one, and the world's second largest economy will not change anytime soon.
Telling Washington to step down means following the will, but publicly giving in to the US would be too embarrassing for <0x58>i Jinping, the Chinese president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards appropriately, U.S. trade competition pressure can positively support China in the long run by reducing dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that quick political decisions by Washington or Beijing can make conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries actually more dangerous than what observers have known before," said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of voluntary refugees and offers help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government went on to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore them as they once were.
All conditions are now present because of the voluntary return of refugees to the country they must leave because of terrorism and the thorough economic decisions that make their daily lives and livelihoods a target.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled Syria since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from countries supporting the insurgency.
Europe secures Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup beating Team U.S. with the final scores of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its trophy as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who attempted almost throughout the tournament, hit his tee hit into the water on the par-3 of the 16th hole, conceding his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone throughout his round, becoming 1 of 4 players to ever get 5-0-0 since the format in effect in the tournament began in 1979.
American athlete Jordan Spieth was defeated 5<0x26>4 by the lowest-order player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2nd and 1st to England's Ian Poulter who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia of Spain became European with an overall win with a career point of 25.5 at this tournament.
“I don’t usually cry but I can’t stand it today.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you so much to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy I can help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He gave his responsibilities to compatriot John Ram who defeated legendary U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in a single game on Sunday.
“The amazing pride I felt, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career records.
Odd statistics by one of the best players of all time, have won 14 major titles just under Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to get fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fight.
There was a time this morning when we were making Europe difficult.
We had a fight.
With respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to restructure, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to step forward.
I love these 12 people and I am proud to be a captain.
You have to pay your respects.
We lost the upper hand."
