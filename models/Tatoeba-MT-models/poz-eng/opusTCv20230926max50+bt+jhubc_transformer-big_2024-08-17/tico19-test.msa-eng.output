I wonder how long these symptoms have been going on.
And all breast pain should be treated in this way, especially at your age.
and accompanied by a fever.
You also need to check your blood pressure.
Are you having a fever right now?
Are you having chest pain right now?
Do you have difficulty breathing?
Can you tell me what other symptoms you're having?
How high is your temperature.
And I'm a sucker too.
And I'm having a bit of a snooze and a bit of a snooze.
and my chest really hurts today
Now is the right time for your allergies.
And he got a chest pain.

Is there anyone else who is sick like you at home with the same symptoms as you?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Do you have any shortness of breath?
You're still having chest pain?
Because it's the flu season.
But we also shouldn't be ruled out for chest pain that comes from the heart's cardiology.
But the most important thing right now is the pain.
But I'm having trouble breathing.
I know a lot of people are cheating on me.
But we need to take every chest pain seriously.
You're breathing well now, aren't you?
Because of the pain, I instantly forgot.

Or someone sitting on your chest?
It is more or less the same as a fever and cough headache and muscle pain.
Right in the middle of my heart
Show me where you're hurting.
Because you have a fever.
So do you think some of those symptoms may be related to your pregnant condition?
Do your children have the same symptoms?
Tell me about your pain.
The fever rises at night.

The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly increasing in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, despite being at different levels depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness for an increasing number of patients with COVID-19 who will require health care, and in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases from an unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent is a novel coronavirus that is now referred to as acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date it has been proven that about 80<0x25> of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild illness, e.g. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients recover.
In about 14<0x25> of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospital treatment while the remaining 6<0x25> of cases suffer from a critical illness requiring intensive care.
The deaths of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 are about 4<0x25>.
In this study, we evaluated trends in cumulative incidences of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) as well as compared those countries to Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 is undergoing further geographical transmission and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world are currently in line with the country's dynamics.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO's case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 among those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), which between 31 December 2019 and includes that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in every country around the world, obtained from official sources only such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, as well as to compare that data with Italy.
As a proxy for the active spread of COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the cumulative incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural route of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period 1 January-15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases notified for each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to the number of Italian cases for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend in the cumulative incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly around 28 February 2020 (Additional material).
This is largely driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show similar increasing trends for cumulative incidences of COVID-19 (Additional Materials).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to cases in Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
It stressed that, as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported the same number of cases as Italy just 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases notified is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed cumulative incidence trend of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is spreading at the same pace in all countries.
While countries are at different levels, diversity in national public health responses and case definitions may vary across countries as well as different protocols for selecting patients who must be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10<0x25> of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at the EU/EEA level for 6<0x25> and 1<0x25> cases only, respectively (data are not shown).
However, the data should be collected in a systematic way to support current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
Studies conducted in 2010-11 showed considerable variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds for every 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that the country had more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
A modeling scenario related to the saturation of healthcare capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK for the spread of hospitalised COVID-19 cases associated with <0x3E>90<0x25> risk of exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds, is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Given that so far cases have formed clusters in specific EU/EEA countries and the UK, as well as hospitals and intensive care units typically handle a clear population focus area, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided in the Nomenclature for regional units for the statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries indicate the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a scenario of gradual community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19-infected patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is happening in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the ECDC's recent rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to slow the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a curbing approach to reduction, as the expectation of a rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, receive and adjust their responses accordingly if not implemented earlier.
A quick risk assessment also lists general health care measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity that sees countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce stress on health care.
If this fails, it is likely that other EU/EEA countries' health care systems will face an increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a catastrophe for humans.
Just like its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of humans in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also spread from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but is more contagious and affects more elderly people than teenagers and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive view of the rapidly growing subject of research.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this review helps in understanding and eradicating the life-threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unexpected and unforgettable memory for Chinese people who were urged to stay home for the entire holiday season and weeks after the outbreak of a novel virus.
The virus is very homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the related disease is named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients allowed to return home and more than 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "public enemy number 1" and has the potential to become stronger than violence.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 2000 papers have been published on COVID-19 including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since its first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the sequence of viruses isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to summarize the research progress in the new and rapidly growing subject area.
When appropriate, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, triggered in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some other important questions.
CoV is traditionally considered to be a harmless pathogen to humans, usually being the cause of about 15<0x25> of the common cold.
However, in this century, we have twice discovered high-pathogenic human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks of epidemics of their respective origin in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with severe rates of morbidity and mortality.
COVID-19 is currently the third recorded CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a cluster of pneumonia of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to China's National Health Commission.
Seven days later the CoV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first case of death from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, regions and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infections among healthcare staff were reported, indicating that human-to-human infections could occur.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was imposed a curfew with all public transport services suspended.
On 24 January the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which is considered the starting point for infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the disease a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
Since the situation is developing rapidly, the final scope and severity of the disease is yet to be ascertained.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provided more recent illustrations of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects patients of all ages, but most are aged 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7<0x25>) of infected patients are over the age of 50, very few are under the age of 20 and only 14 individuals are infected under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 develops in clusters mostly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from start to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95<0x25> CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted RO is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, commensurate with the time of mass movement before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases is 1.44<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 1.10-1.86<0x25>), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients is 3.06<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 2.02-4.59<0x25>).
The three main factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large, shielded viruses that contain a single thread of sensory RNA.
The virus can be divided into four genera, e.g., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, among all alpha- and beta-CoV are known to infect humans.
Spike (S) surface glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor enzyme modifier angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for respectively SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane amalgamation occurs.
The viral RNA genus is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genus, the genome RNA is accompanied by surface glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forming vesicles containing virions, which then attach to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98<0x25> of the genetic identity in 10 referenced samples taken from the disease's original site, the Huanan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transfer electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in the thinnest part of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was found to be the recipient of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2 weaker than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new simple proteins encoded by orf3b and proteins encoded by orf8.
Orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogeny and have an IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that the cyro-EM structure of human ACE2 is fully at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in a complex with amino transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed confirmation, was combined as a dimer and the ACE-BOAT2 complex can combine two S proteins, which provide evidence for recognition and CoV infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug screening to curb SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and mid-range host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS Cov originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through ferrets and camels.
By comparing the phylogenetics of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered the original hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96<0x25> similar to the two SARS-like CoVs of bats called bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, the intermediate hosts that help the virus to cross species barriers to infect humans remain unknown, and the transmission pathway remains unexplained.
Ji, et al., suggested snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans involving homologous recombinations in the S protein.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolins - long-nosed, ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99<0x25> of the genetic homology in CoV found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1<0x25> difference spread across the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, the final decision to provide concrete evidence is pending (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SRAS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 45 days below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40<0x25>-50<0x25> humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heat radiation at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75<0x25> ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, chlorophoms, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively deactivate the virus.
The entire human population generally has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore considered vulnerable to novel viruses.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, the virus is first identified by the host's natural immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including receptors such as the C-type lectin, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and receptors such as RIG-I (RLRs).
Despite the different pathways, the virus results in the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturity and type I interferon systhesis (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigen macrophages.
However, the N SARS-CoV protein can help the virus avoid an immune response.
Shortly thereafter, the immune response adapts to the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B> T cells continue to kill virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by causing apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity including complements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies is also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from cured patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals in the body that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, as well as, in the worst case scenario, the failure of some organs, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on early clusters, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
Being common to those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is affected, they have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as noted above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, while preventing those who are infected but do not have symptoms from spreading the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to, or infected by, the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by no other symptoms or symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, dizziness, headaches, sore throats, nausea, chest pains, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's condition immediately increases to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities of pulmonary imaging, should be screened for the virus for an early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98<0x25> for fever, 76<0x25> for dry cough, 55<0x25> for dyspnea, and 3<0x25> for diarrhea; 8<0x25> of patients needed breathing assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of family clusters and clusters resulting from the spread of asymptomatic individuals.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98<0x25>), dry cough (47<0x25>), and dyspnea (55<0x25>) as their main symptoms.
However, 80<0x25> of them require respiratory assistance, far more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher linkages by MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26<0x25>) and sore throat (21<0x25>) were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99<0x25>-100<0x25>), dry cough (29<0x25>-75<0x25>), dyspnea (40<0x25>-42<0x25>), diarrhea (20-25<0x25>), and sore throats (13-25<0x25>) are the main symptoms and respiratory assistance has been required for about 14<0x25>-20<0x25> of patients.
As of February 14, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2<0x25> when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the death rate from SARS as of November 2002 was 10<0x25> of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, the mortality rate was 37<0x25> of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Earlier studies reported that the R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with 95<0x25> confidence interval (CI) 5.71-7.23, while the R0 for SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
Comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality rates and RO of the disease are shown in Table 1.1.
The numbers above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to be contagious than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less deadly than the two diseases.
Therefore, it is much more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clustering starts often occur in the same family or from the same gathering or vehicles such as cruise ships.
Patients usually have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with an infected individual or patient in the last two weeks before starting to get sick.
However, it has been reported that patients can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and patients who have recovered who are allowed to return home from the hospital can carry the virus again, which sends a warning to increase quarantine time.
The patient has a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L includes lymphocyte count <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and increased aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia have been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes as well as myoglobin have increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein as well as erythrocyte sedimentation have increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, fibrin degradation products present in the blood, has increased, and the lymphocyte count has significantly decreased.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are manifested by bilateral clustered shadows or opacity of ground glass in the lungs.
Patients usually suffer from atopic pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute difficulty breathing syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, rapid accumulation of fluid and fibrosis adversely affect gas exchange.
Pneumocyte type-I and type-II dysfunctions reduce surfactant stages and increase surface tension, while reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the discovery of poor chest radiography is usually in line with the most severe stage of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of hyalin membranes and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes as well as multinucleate syntium cells in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS and similar to the pathology of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, as a result of the high false negative rate, which may have precipitated the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which are no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurs with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is important as well as imperative for making an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described the protol of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a dip rod in less than a minute.
Hopefully, the new technique can significantly improve sensitivity and convenience if confirmed in a clinical sample.
As a result of lack of experience with novel CoVs, doctors can generally provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or proposed before for other CoV treatments such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatment with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from cured patients is also recommended for use for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 usually attacks the lungs in the early stages and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that produce ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and respiratory failure are major threats to patients and are the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is important to relieve symptoms and save lives as well as include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary grafting technique used for the treatment of cardiopulmonary or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections as well as shock sepsis, and protection of vital organ functions are also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storms result from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of cytokine series including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines trigger immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunization is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunostimulant treatments for cytokine storms include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF restriction; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; 4 cytokine signal suppressor; and HDAC inhibition.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in treating SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids at high doses can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, affecting the prognosis significantly.
However, low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for short periods have been recommended to be used with caution for critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this article, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous use with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective against an American patient infected with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead originally for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed possible inhibition of other single thread RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these observations, Gilead has given the mixture to China to conduct a pair of trials against individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly awaited.
Additionally, baricinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects can occur after combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other drugs used to the patient should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from cured patients and antibody generation
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from being infected with the disease has a long history.
It's true, cured patients usually have relatively high levels of antibodies to pathogens in their blood.
An antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and it identifies unique molecules in the pathogen and then neutralizes them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and had been injected into 10 patients who were in a serious condition.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load as well as increased satiety in the blood.
However, confirmation and explanation are needed to suggest such methods for large-scale use before specific therapies that have not yet been developed.
In addition, due to the presence of therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with the plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma is great for treating critical patients.
It's difficult to wake up and produce special antibodies quickly to fight global epidemics.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients as well as identify a genetic code that encodes effective antibodies or filters effective antibodies against important viral proteins.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends a lot on the combination of various components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or obscure as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the leading alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe levels.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du's capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen's capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest cure rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients have been seen in some regions of China that use TCM in 87<0x25> of their patients, including Gansu (63.7<0x25>), Ningxia (50<0x25>) and Hunan (50<0x25>), while Hubei province, which uses TCM in only about 30<0x25> of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest cure rate (13<0x25>).
However, this is a rather rough comparison as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patient should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study to compare western medicine (WM) treatments alone with a combination of WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, symptom loss and hospital treatment was significantly shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the rates for symptomatic conditions became significantly lower (from mild to severe) for the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone (7.4<0x25> versus 46.2<0x25>) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone (8.8<0x25> versus 39<0x25>).
However, TCM's effectiveness and safety are still awaiting more controlled trials at a greater level and at more centres.
It must be interesting to also describe the mechanism of action and explain the effective components in the treatment of TCM or a combination of such treatments if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 mostly experience intense fear of the highly contagious disease and can cause death, while those who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia and cough as well as the adverse effects of treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to higher anxiety and mental distress.
During the initial phase of the SARS outbreak, various psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide were also reported.
Mandatory contact detection and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause people to feel more worried and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and people connected to them as well as the public community who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
An effective vaccine is essential for disrupting the transmission chain from infected animal and human areas to exposed hosts and typically complements antiviral treatment in epidemic control caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made by developing an S protein-based vaccine to generate long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
Directly debilitating vaccines have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the effectiveness in vivo of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and dangerous models as well as their protection against zoonotic viral infections should be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
By contrast, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to persistent zoonotic resources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticles, particles such as viruses and recombinant protein subunits and some have been tested in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome difficulties because a long period of time (an average of 18 months) is required for the development of a vaccine and a dynamic variation of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just shown a full clinical pathway in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover slowly without re-infection.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is important for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in under-resourced areas.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 usually occurs between the ages of 30-65 years, with 47.7<0x25> of those patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases described above.
Patients who need intensive care are more likely to have hidden comorbidities and complications and are much older than those who do not need them (at the median age of 66 versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognosis factor for COVID-19 patient outcomes.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer acute cardiac injury and arrhythmias.
Cardiovascular disease is also a cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2 positive colangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and hidden diseases are interconnected and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to therapy and final cure.
A link to the CRP level to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict results.
This enzyme is secreted in many different organs, especially the heart and liver, and is released during tissue damage.
Therefore, it has become a traditional marker for heart or liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and progression of clinical symptoms over time should be considered along with other issues to predict the consequences as well as complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunotindicates commonly used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
High doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, many former patients suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress as they often face long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witnessed the deaths of close family members and patient friends.
It is important to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress as well as return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to doubles in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently double in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, infected patients in the early phase or incubation period can produce large amounts of the virus while performing daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is considered to occur during severe illness, while most transmission does not occur in the early phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are underway in China including curfews in Wuhan and surrounding cities as well as the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of severing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these actions have significantly damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, signaling a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the pandemic will end at the end of March and the phase of decline will run for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., modeled for predicting the consequences of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in both the middle and throat swabs of patients who had recovered and left hospital 2 weeks earlier, signaling that the newly identified virus could be a recurrent influenza-like episode.
Yet, convincing signals have occurred in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may be effective.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally brought under control.
Therefore, just like SARS-CoV, it is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes weaker and eventually ends up or becomes a less pathogenic virus that exists alongside humans.
A comparison between the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with substances that have been contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which gave rise to new possibilities of transmission from feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41<0x25> of cases may have been caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health workers.
Therefore, careful precautions should be used to protect people, especially health workers, social workers, family members, friends, even roadside people who are in contact with a patient or infected person.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a face mask; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series <0x23>1860) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from individuals who are likely to be infected from being spread through ventilation or attached to the surface of the material, which in turn can be spread to others.
However, only N95-type masks (series <0x23>1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5<0x25> of virions being able to penetrate N95-type masks; SARS-CoV-2 is almost identical to SARS-CoV in terms of size where both are approximately 85 nm in size.
Since virus particles can penetrate five surgical face masks worn together, health workers who have direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series <0x23>1860s) instead of surgical face masks.
In addition to face masks, health workers need to wear personal protective equipment to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect individuals through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 face mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health workers should also wear a transparent face shield or safety glasses when dealing with patients.
For the general public in the affected or possibly affected areas, it is advisable that all residents wash their hands with disinfectant soap regularly, stay at home and reduce contact with people who are likely to be infected.
The three-foot distance is considered to be the appropriate distance to stay away from the patient.
These measures are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection in addition to preventing the transmission of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, the high homology of SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 alerted China as the SARS epidemic hit in 2003.
However, only on 19 January 2020 the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to reduce the concerns of its citizens by saying that the novel virus has a low infection rate and limited human reproduction as well as prevention and containment of diseases is not a problem.
The message has managed to ease public concern, especially when the whole country is preparing for the Autumn Festival, and it is not welcome to curb the spread of the epidemic on a minimum scale in Wuhan.
The disease control agency in China can take lessons from this and make improvements in the future.
For example, agencies should be (1) more careful in making announcements to the public as every detail presented affects the attitudes and decisions of the people; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information received from clinics than to wait for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more decisively in curbing outbreaks rather than calming the public; and (4) more frequent training to improve public awareness and response to epidemics.
The spread of COVID-19 is due to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that started in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, it has spread to all of China and nearly 50 countries around the world at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is almost identical to SARS-CoV and symptoms are also almost identical to SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sentiment that the SARS outbreak has recurred.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in curbing the epidemic as well as treating patients.
COVID-19 affects people older than younger people and affects men more than women, severity and mortality rates are also higher for the elderly than for the youth.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91<0x25> compared to 1.44<0x25>).
COVID-19 patients can spread the virus without experiencing any symptoms while SARS patients spread the virus in sick conditions, resulting in difficulty in curbing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
The RNA test results for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for COVID-19 patients.
However, patients who have recovered can find the virus positive again.
These findings indirectly increase the risk of viral transmission.
Based on the rapid progress in the study of COVID-19, several critical issues remain to be explored, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96<0x25> of genetic homologs are found in SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs such as SARS bats, we can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 also comes from bats.
What animal is an intermediate species that transmits the virus from a host, for example a bat, to a human?
Without knowing the answers to <0x23>1 and 2, we cannot efficiently decide the transmission, and the outbreak can recur at any time.
Although molecular and biochemical model tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2, how exactly can the virus enter airway cells and subsequently result in pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2 expression cells to other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically through transmission among humans?
Will it be a worldwide pandemic, wiped out like SARS or repeated periodically like the flu?
This is important but it will take time to find answers to the above questions and a variety of other questions.
However, no matter the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
The zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its main host, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCOVs) had been known to cause mild illness, such as the flu.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have changed views and revealed how HCoV is terrible and can be life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China at the end of 2019 has drawn attention to CoV and surprised us with its simple but less pathogenic infectivity compared to SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic and an understanding of the zoonotic origin of HCoV can help us.
Most HCoVs come from bats that are not pathogenic.
An intermediate reservoir host for some HCoVs is also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Investigations of the interaction of CoV hosts in animals allow the importance of understanding of the pathogenesis of CoV in humans to be derived.
In this study, we presented an overview of the existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as the zoonotic origin and transmission between species.
Importantly, we compare and contrast HCoV differences from the perspective of viral evolution and genome reassemblement.
Epidemic diseases during COVID-19 are discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for a successful host exchange as well as implications for the evolution of the virus against the severity of the disease are also emphasized.
Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a single group of threaded, positive-felt, sheathed RNA viruses.
This genome is between 26 and 32 kilobases long and is the largest genome among RNA viruses and is named "CoV" because of its morphological shape that looks like a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of structure, CoVs have a non-segmented genome that shares the same arrangement.
It is estimated that two-thirds of these genomes have two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are then translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replicase.
Polyproteins are then processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, known as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORFs for structured proteins, including papules (S), envelopes (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Some customer-specific protein accessory proteins are also coded according to different CoV customers.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the beta-Cov genera consist of most HCoVs and are divided into four sequences (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and mice act as gene sources for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the primary reservoirs for gamma-CoV and delta-coV.
For thousands of years, CoV has surpassed species resistance and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, 7 human coronaviruses (HCOV) have been identified.
Among these are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 which are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, newly identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, resulting in severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients who have a high probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients suffering from the flu in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which result in symptoms of self-control.
This concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infection is harmless until the SARS outbreak appears.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 and is one of the most devastating in history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a roughly 10<0x25> fatality rate.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread around the world.
The novel HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is a continuing epidemic-causing agent of the 2010 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-1), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 individuals as of March 3, 2020.
Warnings have been given and the world needs to be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, mice and domestic animals.
Various evidence supports the evolutionary origins of all HCovs from bats, where the virus is adaptable and non-pathogenic but shows great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought major medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the rest of the world.
The detection of HCoV's zoonotic origins provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and limiting factors for species jumping.
It may also guide and facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediaries and boosters for SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in future spill prevention.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoV.
In particular, we outline and discuss a common theme where HCoV virions are not pathogenic in the host's natural reservoir but become pathogenic after interspecific transmission to the new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary direction of HCoV, where increased transmission often comes with a reduction in pathogenicity.
The results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal coV has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from nasal dissection of flu-affected patients, different CoVs were isolated in a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) can provide information and teaching.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of a patient who had a germ infection in the upper respiratory tract in 1966, and subsequently was adapted to grow within the WI-38 line of lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E are seen with flu symptoms, including headache, sneezing, lethargy and sore throat, with fever and cough seen in 10<0x7E>20<0x25> of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequently serialized citations in the brains of nursing rats.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection is seen to be similar to that of HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and tend to transmit more during winter in temperate regions.
Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by the disease for about 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E experienced a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients show severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first well-recorded HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
In addition to the super spread, it is estimated that each case can cause about two secondary cases, with incubation periods ranging between 4 to 7 days and a virus-free peak appearing on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show mialgia, headache, fever, fever, fever and cold, followed by dyspnea, coughing and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphofenia, a test of diffuse liver function and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Diffusion of alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30<0x25> of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to infections of the lower respiratory tract, various organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can cause death especially in compromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative to an index patient traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a lot of research has been done on HCOV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially found to be widespread among children, elderly people and patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of choriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause for about 4.7<0x25> of common respiratory diseases and the peak time for the disease is during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as a crutch.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community-infected bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has also been reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbations.
Just like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four infected HCoVs in this community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents do occur for unknown reasons as there are rare cases of the more destructive subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Generally speaking, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to spread efficiently and to remain continuously in the human body, the virus also becomes less harmful or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary transmission to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations for MERS resemble SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also suffer from acute kidney failure, which has so far been unique to MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30<0x25> of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high case death rate of 34.4<0x25>, making MERS-CoV one of the worst viruses to hit humans.
During mid to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively known to be related to SARS-CoV-2 infections was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Public Health Emergency at the International Level and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been reported worldwide, with violent case deaths of 3.4<0x25>.
Significantly, case deaths in Hubei, China were 4.2<0x25>, while case deaths outside the area were 1.2<0x25>.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea also occurs in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can increase rapidly into acute difficulty breathing syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence homology of 82<0x25>, the virus clustered into different branches on phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to rapid transmission worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals very interesting similarities as well as differences.
First, the incubation time and the period of occurrence of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs found from the community (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows features that are more commonly seen during infection with HCoV found from the community, including the presence of nonspecific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly low.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting pattern features for both HCoV found from the community and SARS-CoV.
In one sense, the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCoV found in the community.
On the other hand, it is difficult to confirm whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is reduced after passing through humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
Whether fecal-to-mouth transmission for SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under certain circumstances awaits enlightenment through future studies.
It's also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may be seasonally triggered as in the case of infected HCoV in the community.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including the continued infectivity, pathogenicity and spread after human passage will affect the eventual fate of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
All four infected HCoVs in the community causing mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both of them may have survived the past HCoV pandemic.
The HCoV that causes severe disease in humans and humans with severe HCoV disease has been eliminated.
To allow this to happen, HCoV needs to double in humans to a sufficient level to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that fight host restriction factors.
Therefore, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more humans are infected, the greater the chance for the virus to fully adapt to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to prevent with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four infected CoVs in the community circulate in the human population, triggering a common cold in the subject of a compromised immunocompromised.
The virus does not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and the transmission of the virus in humans is unsustainable.
The virus must remain and reproduce in its zoonotic reservoir and find opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate hosts and breeders.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same characteristics as both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs that are infected in the community.
It's very contagious like an infected HCoV in the community, at least at the moment.
However, the virus is more pathogenic than community-infected HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
The time will determine whether the virus will fully adapt to humans and spread among humans without reservoirs or intermediate animal hosts.
Before discussing the origins of the animals that cause HCoV, it is better to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary hosts, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and HCoV breeding.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoV if it has a very close heirloom that shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequencing level.
The heredity virus usually adapts well and is not pathogenic in this hose.
Likewise, reservoir hosts keep HCoV continuously and for the long term.
In both cases, the host is usually infected naturally and is a natural host for HCoV or its virions.
On the other hand, if a new HCoV is introduced to the intermediate host before or around its introduction to humans, the virus does not adapt well to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
These intermediate hosts can act as a zoonotic source for human infection and play a role as a breeding host by allowing the virus to temporarily double and then spreading the virus to humans to strengthen the scale of human infection.
HCoV can develop a dead-end road infection if it is unable to maintain its infectivity in the intermediate hose.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to intermediate hosts and also create a long-term pandemic.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveals retrospectively that cases of the SARS index have a history of contact with game animals.
Further seroprevalence investigations show that animal sellers have a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG than the general public.
The lamri and raccoon dogs on the live animal market were first identified to carry viruses such as SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This is supported indirectly by the fact that no SARS has been reported again after killing all the ferrets on the market.
However, it has been reported that lamri ferrets from forests or farms without exposure to the live animal market are mostly negative SARS-CoV, suggesting that lamri ferrets may only serve to strengthen intermediaries but not natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV.
Most notably, since 80<0x25> of the different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it is likely that various species of small mammals may also host a reinforcing intermediate for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of this seems to be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV.
Further searches for natural animal hosts for SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, dubbed CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) bat Rhinolophus, which is related to SARS, which exists in Chinese bats.
The bat is positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
These bats and other CoV bats share 88-92<0x25> of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
This study has provided the basis for a new concept that bat hoses produce human pathogens.
Some CoVs such as SARS (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none except one named WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin exchange enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the recipient for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from a sample of bat feces was shown using bats, ferrets and human ACE2 as recipients for cell entry.
More interestingly, SARS patients are found to be able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related lineage to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95<0x25> of nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is a high degree of homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus for SARS-CoV and bats are not a direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis puts MERS-CoV into the same group as the CoV-HKU4 bat and the CoV-HKU5 bat.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV bats use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
RNA polymerase sequences dependent on RNA from MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to viruses in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no living MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and the closest family of CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87<0x25> of nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a direct reservoir host to MERS-CoV.
In contrast, studies in the Middle East have shown that arabic camels positively impact MERS-CoV-specific neutralization antibodies, just as camels in the Middle East are native to various African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, a virus similar to that found in humans, was isolated via an arab camel nasal swab, further indicating that the camel served as a pure MERS-CoV reservoir host.
It is also worth noting that generally moderate symptoms but large decay of the virus have been observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
In particular, infected camels release viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-mouth pathway, which is also a pathway for viruses to be released from bats.
However, the question remains since many confirmed cases of MERS had no history of contact with camels before symptoms began, possibly linked to a human-to-human transmission pathway or an unknown transmission pathway involving unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2<0x25> homologous nucleotides with CoV RaTG13 bats isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
In cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the deviation of the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the parent relationship.
Arguably, bats may not be the closest reservoir host to SARS-CoV-2 but a nearly similar bat CoV is found in the future.
Perhaps, the intermediate animal hosts to SARS-CoV-2 are from the wild species sold and killed at the Huanan Sea Food Wholesale Market, which is linked to many early cases of COVID-19, suggesting a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
Some recent studies based on a metagenomic sequence have suggested that a group of small threatened mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also store beta-CoV lineages associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The cov genome shares 85-92<0x25> of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are both closely related to RaTG13 with about 90<0x25> identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped in two subgenres of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in the pilogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RDB) that is more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4<0x25> amino acid sequence identity.
In real differences, RBD from SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more deviant, despite having a higher degree of genome-wide homology sequencing.
Previous studies of infected pangolins also reported detection of viral contaminants from lung samples, which were later found to be similarly linked to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a method of collecting and selecting manual sequences to generate a partial genome sequence that accounted for about 86.3<0x25> of the full viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that SARS-CoV-2 originated directly from pangolins due to the deviation of the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV is related to SARS-CoV-2 pangolins.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be established.
While the highest sequence homology has been found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, beta-CoV is linked to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG12 which share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
Strong speculation holds that the high level similarities between RBD from beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2 pangolins and SARS-CoV-2 are driven by the evolution of concentrated selection.
A counterintuitive proposal is in favor of a re-combination between beta-CoV related SARS-CoV-2 pangolins and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving force, re-enlistment occurs extensively in beta-CoV.
Studies are still being conducted on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoV, while virions HCoV-OC43 and HCov-HCU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in a North American three-colored bat showed close contact with HCoV-NL63.
In contrast, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/Ghana Kwam/19/2008, which has been detected in Ghana, while camelid has also been suspected to be an intermediate host.
To be clear, current knowledge of the animal origins of known HCoV is formulated in Figures 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for HCoV transmission events between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E transmission between species is vague.
But alpha-CoV bats that are closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
One of them is alpha-cov alpaca.
Some lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpacas may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Second, alfa-CoV bats associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alfa-CoV alpaca triggers respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpaca is not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas get alpha-CoV-related HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transfer HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, although the alfa-CoV bats are downstream of the HCoV-229E gene, alpacas and arabic camels may be intermediate hosts that transfer the virus to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is the best example of transmission between species from bats to arabic camels and from arab camels to humans.
The original evolution of MERS-CoV from bats is known at the beginning of the introduction and has been corroborated by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide a subset of viral species for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong flying ability are all encouraging conditions for bats to become ideal 'spreaders of the virus'.
In addition, MERS-CoV has been introduced to arab camels for decades.
It adapts well to these camels that have switched from intermediate hoses to stable and natural reservoir hoses.
MERS-CoV causes very mild diseases and maintains relatively low mutation rates in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is accidental and humans remain the final host to MERS-CoV because its transmission is unsustainable.
In contrast to the function of the camel in the spread of MERS-CoV, the function of the pangolin, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
Primarily, beta-CoV pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the final host for the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, similar to the weasel in the case of SARS-CoV.
Some possibilities for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between species from animal to human should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, bats can be reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, the pangolin can be one of the intermediate booster hosts newly identified by the SARS-CoV-2-related virus.
Humans are infected with viruses through slaughtering and eating game animals.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
A review of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is required.
Third, as noted above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that had contact with both bats and pangolins.
Animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 are still being sought.
Aside from the different types of host animals, the three main factors on the virus side are also important in making it easier for CoVs to get past species barriers.
First, relative rates of their mutations are high in RNA replication.
Compared to single thread RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutations can be thought of as "simple" to "high" with the average exchange rate being <0x7E>10-4 exchanges per year per 2 sites, depending on the CoV's phase of adaptation to the novel host.
CoV has a profiling exoribonucleas, its blackout causing very high variability and weakening or possibly even lack of vitality.
Interestingly, Remdesivir's nucleotide analogs are known to suppress CoV replication through the inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the best anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
Even so, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than that of its host.
In addition, mutation rates are often high when the CoV does not adapt well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, mutation rates in SARS-CoV-2 seem to be low, suggesting a high degree of adaptation to humans.
Perhaps, he had already adapted to other hosts that were close to humans.
Apart from SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which adapts well to arab camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that a genetic shift will make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in a short period of time.
Second, the largest RNA genomes in the CoV use additional plasticity in genome changes for mutations and recombinations, while increasing the probability of joint evolution between species, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by a large number of unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3' end of the genome.
Third, CoVs change templates randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a unique "imitation-choose" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixed container, thread exchange often occurs during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Very homologous, subgenomic and full RNAs can be recombined to produce new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural incorporation has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as CoV animals such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
The interaction of the host virus is related to transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host receptor is another major factor that affects the transmission between species.
Here, the re-combination of SARS-CoV is taken as a special example, which also shows evidence of positive choice during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis between human incubation and SARS-CoV feral, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptations in different hosts, especially with mutations in RBD on the S protein.
Generally, the RBDs on the S protein on the CoV interact with the cells and are strongly selected by the hose's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids of S1 fragments, which bind to human ACE2 as well as co-receptors for viral entry.
The RBD from SARS-CoV was able to identify ACE2 receptors from a variety of animals, including bats, ferrets, rats and raccoons, allowing the spread of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues are observed as distinct from human and ferret virus in RBD and 4 of them are located within receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV ferrets have mutations of K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the interaction of the random protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, both amino acid exchanges may be important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same receptor cells as SARS-CoV.
The 30<0x25> difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that the S protein's affinity with human ACE2 may have been altered.
Indeed, cryo-EM research shows this bonding relationship is 10 to 20 times higher than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors may be needed for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
More interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors that exist, such as N aminopeptidase for HCoV-229E, and 9-O teracetyl sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
It may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after transmission between species from its animal hosts.
Apart from cellular receivers, the consequences of transmission between HCoV species also depend on host dependence and other barrier factors.
These differences in hose proteins between humans and HCoV natural reservoir hosts such as bats, arabic camels and rodents may create a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoV needs to seize the host dependent factor and subvert the host restriction factor for transmission between successful species.
In this case, the molecular determinants in the important areas of these viral-hos interactions are still not identified and characterized.
Screening around unbiased genomes for hose dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology may pay off.
The rise of HCoV novel: back to the beginning
The diversity of bat CoVs provides a wide opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this regard, the bat's CoV acts as a pool of the HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombinations also drive the evolution of HCoV and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein encoding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered as important in adapting to humans, as the SARS-CoV-related bat virus has been isolated but found to encode the protruding ORF8 protein.
A feature of the nucleotide-29 eradication of SARS-CoV has been found in isolated strains at the onset of the human epidemic.
This deletion separates ORF8a into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation that promotes host exchange.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible recombinant history with alpha and gamma CoV lineages, which a large number of smaller recombinant areas have been identified in RNA-dependent polymerases.
The recombinant location is also identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to experience a recombinant occurrence between different breeds, which occurs in arabic camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs, which saw HCoVs rejoin other animal CoVs in its non-structural genes.
A warning should also be given that fake selection can contribute to accidental changes in the viral genome, which are likely to result from releasing the virus from the pressure of the selection imposed, such as by the host's immune system.
An example of this effect is the loss of full length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototyping thread, due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
While robust ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpacea displays a single nucleotide insertion, which results in skeletal displacement.
Finally, the evolution of the novel HCoV was also spurred by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or mild symptoms have only been detected when bats are infected with CoV, marking a co-adaptation between CoV and bat.
It seems that bats adapt well to CoV both anatomically and psychologically.
For example, damage in the activation of pro-inflammatory responses in bats efficiently reduces the pathologies triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is inhibited as a result of increased regulation of NKG2/CD94 inhibitory natural killer cell receptors and low levels of expression for the major histokesatonic complex class 1 molecules.
Furthermore, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the bat's high metabolic activity can both withstand CoV multiplication and affect profuse readings by exoribonuclease, as well as put pressure on selection for the care of highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced to the new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for hose adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three novel HCoVs have appeared in the past two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hoses such as bats and camels.
It doubles quickly without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where the secret causes of asymptomatic carriers are seen and the cause for severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mostly the result of hyper-activation of immune responses and cytokine storms where the stronger the immune response, the worse the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been inhibited from replicating CoV.
The same strategy that blocks the immune response may have a beneficial effect on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is very strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type 1 interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of inflammasomes in bats is ineffective.
For this reason, NLRP3 inflammatory inhibition with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a common theme of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although beta-CoV bats that share 95<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there is also CoV bats that share 96<0x25> of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although ferrets and other animals on the market have been found to have viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Beta-CoV pangolins that are highly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, signaling that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV pangolins may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the question, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by humans intentionally or unintentionally.
CoV has returned to the spotlight as a result of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies on CoV in bats and other animals have drastically changed our view of the importance of zoonotic and animal reservoirs for HCoV in human transmission.
Comprehensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have their origins in bats and are transferred to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and ferrets in the market, closing the wet market and killing ferrets should be able to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, due to the discovery of multiple lineages of beta-CoV pangolins that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the weather and the way SARS-CoV-2 is transferred to humans through pangolins and other mammals will need to be explained in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in arabic camels for a long time.
This camel has become an important tool for transportation as well as a major source of meat, dairy, leather and fur products for the local community.
This camel is found throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as is claimed in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the re-infection of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, which is combined with other infection control measures.
Since we can't get rid of this virus, new genotypes may appear to cause outbreaks.
Various zoonotic CoVs are spread out in the forest.
In particular, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are many opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and regroup, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are more contagious and/or could kill in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China must be stopped to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response design should be made.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
The virus remains in a natural reservoir until there is a chance of transmission.
Although bats have many features that facilitate the spread of the virus, human chances of having contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if the public is educated to stay away from the animal.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans as well as future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is by humans staying away from the ecological nic of natural reservoirs for zoonotic viruses.
Some of the questions about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remain unanswered.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 legacy virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to see how bats and pangolins can share the same ecological nic.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, we must determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, the way it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins needs to be explained.
Finally, since many mammals including exotic animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental monitoring and infection should be carried out.
Whether bats, pangolins or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or a similar host virus will be identified in its natural host in the future.
An ongoing investigation within this area will explain the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Update the diagnostic criteria of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" for COVID-19 required
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline provides our experience as a good reference for fighting this pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing slowly based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also updated continuously.
In this letter, we have responded to a review of our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-10 a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick advice guideline and the guide was published in Military Health Research on Feb 06, 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasing slowly based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies for continuous updating.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, have released a total of seven editions with some contexts significantly altered.
Now that our guidelines received reviews by Zhou et al., they introduced easy scoring suggestions based on their clinical experience.
Their efforts add new evidence to our guidelines and are also a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We acknowledge their important efforts and thank them.
However, their efforts also require updates in accordance with the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition of the trial) and the latest studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case requires the combination of any one item from an epidemiological historical feature with two items of clinical manifestation to produce a thorough analysis, or it is necessary to meet three items of clinical manifestation if without a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or living in Wuhan city and neighborhood, or other communities where COVID-19 cases are reported within 14 days before symptoms begin; (2) history of contact with SAR-CoV-2 case infection (with positive test of nucleic acid); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city and surrounding area, or other community of COVID-19 cases have been reported.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with the imaging feature of COVID-19 infection; (3) white blood cell count indicates normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte count in the early stages.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any one pathogenic item or serologic evidence as follows: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a genome-wide sequence of the virus indicates high homogeneity to a known novel coronavirus; (3) a positive for IgM antibodies and an IgG antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies;
We can see that real-time PCR tests for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples were added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples has been included in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); and then serological evidence was included in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the ongoing work of researchers who are looking for optimal nucleic acid detection kits for immediate detection, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which increase the availability of different specimens, and support bringing specific antibody positive results into the verified criteria.
In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that reminds us to be on the lookout for typical or asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, flow charts from Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify invidivu without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system should also be verified in practice and further clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come and call on readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", we propose to detect and comply with the new guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to a virus.
As of Monday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Plague Studies (IEDCR) reported the total number of infections recorded including 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases sitting at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were over the age of 60, two of them 51 and 60, and 41-50 years old.
He also said the two victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID 19 a pandemic on March 11.
Hospital officials told a local news source, Anadolu Agency, that one of the sick was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait's Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obaidul Quader said public transport would be closed for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The closure of public transport began on March 26 and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods -- drugs, oil and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded COVID-19 infection incident in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people returning from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, all three have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19, the outbreak caused by the coronavirus.
This benchmark was present on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claims, as of Thursday, it is among the few countries free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, contributing to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopksins University, more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. on Wednesday from coronavirus infection.
Around the world, countries announced stricter measures to stop the outbreak from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergie Sobyanin, Moscow's city chief, extended the city's closure until May 1.
Across the country, President Vladimir Putin announced Russian citizens may continue to be paid salaries without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the emergency to 15 days; votes were confirmed with 215 votes in favour, ten abstaining, and one opposing.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Makkah and Medina to the rest of the day; previously, curfews were only implemented between 3pm and 6am.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew order between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia have reduced the amount of toilet paper once a transaction has taken place.
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toilet paper to two and a package of one transaction each at all stores at the national level.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit, on Monday.
This limit is broadcast as an order on the exit list, and on the chain's Facebook page.
Buyers are reportedly buying stocks due to fears of COVID-19 if individuals need to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for the purchase of home delivery to one pack per order.
This change was followed by a four-pack restriction for each transaction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in a March 8 press release, reported that with the implementation of the four-pack restriction, "many stores still ran out of stock within an hour after delivery", and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales increased in a "sudden rise" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packs last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles booked packages larger than suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworths booked additional stock, while ALDI made stock for a special Wednesday plan available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers' Association, said retailers were trying to increase stock but local council restrictions at the time of delivery by trucks made it difficult.
He expects an increase in product costs, when suppliers try to meet demand, and a bit of a special one.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the initial production of the stock, some stores could not run a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist from Queensland University of Technology, said the store was filling up every night.
He tells the toilet tissue is a large item, leads to a low quantity on the volume of the stock, and, when it is sold out, leaves a large empty shelf space, further strengthening the feeling of inadequacy.
Coles and Woolworths had the view [that] if there were a variety of goods on the shelf, if products such as toilet paper and dehumidifiers could be [purchased] and had quantity, you would probably reduce the panic Russell Zimmerman said on ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap on Wednesday was out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex Toilet Wipes, and Solaris Paper who makes Sorbent, insist that they work 24/7 to maintain supplies, according to a New.com.au report.
Domain.com, the property site, reported some real estate sellers offering toilet paper for free to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne, when a small auction was held due to shoppers facing holiday time during the long weekend of Workers' Day.
Thursday's edition of the NT News, a daily print in Darwin, included eight additional pages intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Shops were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3, which saw them saying they had no plans to introduce limits on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, dehumidifiers, dry food, handwashing tools and floors.
Also outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the Ocado online supermarket was seen limiting the purchase of Andres toilet tissue to two 12-packs.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO)'s ongoing COVID-19 outbreak — a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — as a pandemic.
While the word "pandemic" only refers to the extent to which the disease has spread, not how dangerous the particular case is, WHO is aware of the need to urge the government to act:
All countries can change the course of the pandemic.
If the country detects, tests, treats, isolates, tracks and moves its people to action, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are very concerned about both the level of transmission and the severity of the alarming and the level of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was "unprecedented."
He said, in a quote published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected from the emergence of an ongoing worldwide transmission."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we've never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "in short, things are going to get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, causing more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared as a Public Health Emergency on the International Stage on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, causing about 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have been cured.
Case death rates have been estimated at 4<0x25> in China, while worldwide ranged from 13.04<0x25> in Algeria to .08<0x25> in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually around five days, but may be between two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic therapy and support. The proposed preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth during coughing, maintaining distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for those who suspect themselves to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control and facility closures.
The pandemic has caused global socioeconomic disruption, suspension or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread supply shortages spurred by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been closed either nationwide or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, as well as those from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of travel cuts and heavy industry closures, there has been a decline in air pollution as well as carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases from an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and caused the virus to be thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak was known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The earliest known person to experience such symptoms was later found to have fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no visible contact with the then-wet market cluster.
For the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case that was traced back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province, may be the first.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, during the recent reported cases reported in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Koea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases for the first time.
There may be a corresponding number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported in adolescents, with those aged 19 and below equaling 2.4<0x25> of cases worldwide. The United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60<0x25> of the British population should be infected before effective cluster immunity can be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose tests have been positive according to the official protocol.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of its population, and many countries have had an official policy of not testing those with mild symptoms alone, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, it was estimated that 86<0x25> of COVID-19 infections had not yet been detected, and that these unrecorded infections were the source for 79<0x25> of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the increase number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number may be 5.7.
Most people who have COVID-19 have recovered.
For those who don't, the period of development of symptoms until death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5 about 80<0x25> of deaths are among those over the age of 60, and 75<0x25> have existing health problems including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official death count from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the dead who have tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who died without being tested - e.g. at home, in a care center, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated "We know that [the stated number of deaths] is a low estimate", a statement supported by an anecdotal report on undercounts in the U.S. Such underestimation is common in pandemics, as during the January 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures have been widely used to express the number of deaths.
This figure varies by area and by time, as well as is influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of deaths by case illustrates the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in the given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-to-case mortality ratio was 6.0<0x25> (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The numbers vary by area.
In China, estimates for the ratio of deaths with cases decreased from 17.3<0x25> (for those with symptoms starting 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7<0x25> (for those with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020).Other measurements include the case death rate (CFR), which describes the percentage of those diagnosed as dying from disease, and the rate of infection death (IFR), which describes the percentage of those who are infected and who are not diagnosed (diagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population of infections through case-solving.
A number of academics have tried to calculate this number for a specific population.
The Oxford University Evidence-Based Medicine Centre estimated that the overall infection mortality rate for the pandemic was between 0.1<0x25> and 0.39<0x25>.
The top estimates for this range are consistent with results from the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany, and statistical studies that analyze the effect of tests on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization says the pandemic is under control.
The peak and peak duration of the outbreak are uncertain and can vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states, "Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks usually flatten and then begin to degenerate when the disease runs out of available housing.
But it is almost impossible to make any reasonable projections now as to when that will happen."
China's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that the "pandemic could end by June" if all countries could be moved to comply with WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene <0x26> Drugs stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, maybe for a year or two".
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (perhaps 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I don't think it's possible that this coronavirus - because it's so contagious - will disappear completely" and that it "may become a seasonal disease, re-emerging every year".
The severity of that recurrence will depend on the immunity of the group and the stage of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and the infected person may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88<0x25>) and dry cough (68<0x25>).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory sputum (swelling), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. The WHO states that about one in six people become very ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as persistent breathing difficulties, pain or pressure on the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty to wake up, and the eyes or lips to become bluish; immediate medical treatment is advised if these symptoms are present. The further increase in the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, appendicitis, appendicitis and appendicitis.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results confirming infection, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact with a confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and checked to ensure there is no infection.
China estimates the asymptomatic ratio ranges from slightly to 44<0x25>.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms begins) ranges from one to 14 days; most common is five days.For example, the estimated fraction of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell is initially 30<0x25> and then decreases to 15<0x25>.
Some details on how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through small droplets resulting during coughing, sneezing, or speaking; with close contact at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that an unprotected cough will cause the ai droplets to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus may also be transmissible through small droplets that remain for longer periods of time in the air, which may be generated during speech. Respiratory droplets may also result during exhalation, including during speech, although the virus is generally not airborne.
The droplets can land in the mouth or nose of people nearby or may be sucked into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions to become secreted and therefore produce airborne spread.
The virus can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then they touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus may spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of fecal transmission to the mouth of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but the infection may occur before symptoms appear and at a later stage for the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission can occur before the appearance of noticeable symptoms.
Few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic case reports exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not very clear how easily the disease spreads, one usually infects two to three other people. The virus remains for hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastics (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steels, for a day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities advise washing hands after touching animals, such as after touching other surfaces that may have been touched by those infected.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All novel features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in relation to coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which destroys its protective sheath.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (descendant B) along with two threads obtained from bats.
The virus is 96<0x25> similar at full genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in a specific part of the genome sequence between the pangolin and the virus from humans.
The genome-wide differences to date have found at most 92<0x25> of the genetic material shared between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove the pangolin as an intermediate host.
Infection by the virus can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, although the eventual diagnosis is via reverse transcription of a polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with most of its imaging features overlapping with the process of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used to screen or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19".
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-1, with the first being issued on January 17.
The test used reverse transcription of real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be carried out on a respiratory or blood sample.
Test results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
Usually this test is carried out with a nasopharyngeal swab but the throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests have been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the U.S. the serology test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by a certified laboratory only.
Characteristic imaging features on radiographs and computer tomography (CT) of symptomatic mice include asymmetric periphery ground glass evaporation and absent pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Association is gathering an intercontinental online database to find imaging for confirmed cases.
As a result of the patterning with other infections such as adenoviruses, the imaging of PCR-certified tnpa has a limited specialization in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results with PCR and showed that although imaging is less specific to infection, the method is faster and more sensitive, suggesting consideration of the method as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
A network of artificial intelligence-based circular nerves has been developed to detect virus imaging with both radiographs and CT.
Strategies to prevent disease transmission include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing on the tissue and then putting the tissue directly into the trash can.
Those who may have been infected have been advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also proposed to prevent transmission. Many governments have blocked or advised against all nonessential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached the level of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spread in the community, and some community members do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers who care for someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact detection is an important method for determining the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement requesting limits on such surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log a user nearby with another cell phone.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. A wrong response is circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and rinsing with a mouthwash is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands look dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which destroys its protective bubbles.
The CDC further recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60<0x25> alcohol according to the content when soap and water are not available for use.
WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be contaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to disinfectants for stainless steel surfaces), including 62–71<0x25> ethanol, 50–100<0x25> isopropanol, 0.1<0x25> sodium hypochlorite, 0.5<0x25> hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5<0x25> povidon-iodin.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconic chromhexidine, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a facility such as an office or day care center, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by the sick person, should be defused.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with bent arms or tissue during coughing or sneezing, and remove any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the amount and travel distance of expiratory drops spread during speech, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on the time and manner to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene care."
WHO has recommended wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for people with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by community members.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made from cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or being in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from entering public places without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government stipulates that everyone entering the grocery store must wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks every day since mid-March, asked commuters of trains and intercity buses to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama has mandated the wearing of face masks when out, while also recommending the manufacture of face masks at home for those who can't afford face masks.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is accompanied by infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping malls.
Individuals can practice social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments now require or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no COVID-19 transmission is known in the region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings by more than two people. Older adults and those with hidden health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and a compromised immune system faced an increased risk for serious illness and complications as well as having been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas with a social pandemic. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the "physical"
The use of the term "social incarceration" has led to the implication that people should undergo complete social isolation, instead of encouraging them to be in touch with others through alternative means. Some parties have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes the suggestion to have sex only with someone you live with, who doesn't have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended to those who have been detected with COVID-19 and those suspected to have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or proposed self-quarantine to the entire population living in the affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those who belong to the high-risk group.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have previously traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to undergo self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies in controlling the epidemic are containment or repression, and reduction.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate those infected as well as introduce infection control measures and other vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to curb the spread of the disease, efforts are then shifted to the stage of progression: measures are taken to slow the transmission and reduce its impact on the health care system as well as the community.
A combination of curbing and reducing measures may be carried out at the same time.
Stress requires more decisive measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of managing the spread of infectious diseases is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the transmission include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures targeted at physical distancing such as closing schools and canceling mass gatherings; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as targeting surface cleanup.
Other countries have also taken various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced massive screenings and local quarantines, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provides financial support to those infected who quarantine themselves and imposes high fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and fined medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States showed that reducing (slowing down but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppressing (backing the growth of the epidemic) had major challenges.
The optimal reduction policy may reduce health care claims that peak to 2/3 and deaths by half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems to become overloaded.
Bullying can be an option but should be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if that comes first), as the spread will soon bounce back when preventive measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic resulted in social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Eating cold medicines given over the counter, drinking water and resting will help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the consequences.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also noted that some "traditional and at-home treatments" can provide relief for symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increase in capacity and adaptability of healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a basic pandemic response measure.
The ECDC and WHO offices of the European region have issued guidelines for major hospitals and healthcare services to mobilize resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, canceling elective procedures when necessary, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, as well as improving intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are various theories about where the first case (the so-called empty number patient) originated.
The first known case of novel coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei slowly increased.
The case is mostly associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, has a zoonotic origin. The cluster of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by doctor Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan CDC of December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues about the "coronavirus like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, have been warned by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, has been scolded by his superiors for raising the issue.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and notified the WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia have been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other parts of China, aided by the migration of Chinese New Year and Wuhan into transport hubs as well as major railway interchanges.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data later showed that 6,174 people had already shown symptoms as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States has outperformed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and implemented border control.
National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantine (known as home sitting instructions, shelter instructions, or emergency) and lockdown orders.As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90<0x25> of the population, are under a form of emergency in the United States, more than 50 million people are in an emergency in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in an emergency in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are in South Africa.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in a state of emergency, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later —about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID 19 has been traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case was on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixiang observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 26, then his hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing for patient samples on December 27, 2019 showed the presence of coronaviruses such as SARS.
Public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 Dec.
WHO was notified on the same day.
At the time of this notification, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumours" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by Chinese Communist Party chief secretary <0x58>i Jinping as a "people's war" to prevent the spread of the virus.
In what has been dubbed the "largest quarantine in human history", a quarantine siege was announced on January 23 that halted travel into and out of Wuhan, which has extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of at least 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was built after that, Leishenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also renovated 14 other facilities in Wuhan such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government began the next step to curb the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Schools and universities across the country are also closed.
The provinces of Hong Kong and Macau initiated several measures, particularly relating to schools and universities.
Work has begun in some parts of China.
Travel restrictions were designed in and out of Hubei.
Public transport has been modified, and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
Public movement control has been implemented in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) are facing some kind of external restrictions. After the transmission entered the global phase in March, the Chinese government took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from being imported from other countries.
For example, Beijing has enforced a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On March 23, mainland China was only one case of domestic spread within 5 days, in this example the traveler returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that cases of domestic transmission were essentially blocked and the transmission was controlled by China.
Same-day travel restrictions have been relaxed in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the emergency was enforced. China’s Foreign Affairs Minister announced on 26 March 2020 that entry via visa or resident permit holders will be suspended from 28 March onwards, without specific details on the timing of this policy will expire.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and the preparation of financial stimulus packages to firms. The State Council declared the day of mourning began with three minutes of quiet time at 10:00 April 4, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the federal government asked families to show respect online as complying with physical distancing to prevent a repeat COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have been transmitted to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
The national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on Feb. 20, largely linked to a rally in Daegu from a new religious movement known as the Jesus Shincheonji Church.
Shincheonji adherents who visited Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the cause of the outbreak.
As of February 22, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 people or about 13<0x25> reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
As of February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases have been reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 as of February 29.
All South Korean military bases have been quarantined after tests confirmed that three military personnel tested positive for the virus.
The airline's schedule was also affected and therefore the schedule was changed. South Korea introduced a program that is considered to be the world's largest and most organized program to screen populations for virus detection, and isolate any infected individuals as well as track and quarantine the people they are in contact with.
The screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of simpton by new international arrivals via mobile applications, test drive virus with results available the next day, and improved test capabilities that allow up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak even though it did not quarantine the entire city. The South Korean community was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Most Koreans have signed a petition either demanding Moon's dismissal over what they claim to be the government's handling of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of daily cases in four weeks.
On 29 March it was reported that starting 1 April all new overseas arrivals would be quarantined for two weeks.
As reported by the media on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Feb. 19 in Qom, which saw, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people die later that day.
Early preventive measures announced by the government include the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutes, and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the pandemic, and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit intercity travel were announced in March, although traffic jams between cities before the Persian New Year's Nowruz continued.
Shiite dining in Qom remains open to visitors until March 16, 2020. Iran became a center for the spread of the virus after China in February.
Despite allegations about the extent of the outbreak in Iran being covered, more than ten countries have tracked their cases back to Iran by Feb. 28, suggesting that the level of the outbreak may be worse than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government up to that day.
Iran's parliament has been shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prisons to unconditionally release human rights fighters detained for peaceful protests, and to also release all eligible prisoners temporarily.
It noted that there is a greater risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions such as detention centers, which also lack adequate health care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a day, the most number recorded in the country since the outbreak.
At least 12 politicians and government officials or former government officials have died from the disease as of March 17.
As of March 23, Iran is experiencing 50 new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to WHO officials, there may be five times more cases in Iran than reported.
It also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may affect the country's financial ability to respond to the virus outbreak.
The United Nations High Commission on Human Rights has demanded economic sanctions be eased for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to escalate rapidly, urging the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China as well as declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated cluster of COVID-19 cases was subsequently detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Cabinet announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak, including quarantined more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.

A CNN report noted that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test all those infected with the virus to date may be contributing to a high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first emerged as one of the calmest affected countries, and as of March 18, 2020, the British government has not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for being seen as lacking speed and earnestness in its response to the concerns faced by society. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement advising to avoid all nonessential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home whenever possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants, and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced that all places such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80<0x25> of workers' salaries up to a limit of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activities to those determined absolutely necessary.

The WHO has praised the Chinese government's efforts in managing and controlling the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when the Chinese government was accused of secrecy that undermined the prevention and control efforts, as well as the current crisis that saw the central government "give a constant update to avoid panic before the Chinese New Year holiday".
On 23 January, in reaction to the decision of the central government to implement the transport restrictions in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea stated that while the 2009 pandemic was "not necessarily a proposal made by the WHO", it was also "a very important indicator of the commitment to control the epidemic where it is highly concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in the history of general health" on 30 January, following the confirmation of the outbreak in China.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC is a result of "the risk of global transmission especially to low- and middle-income countries without a robust health system.
In response to the implementation of the travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for the measures to unduly restrict international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement."
On February 5, WHO appealed to the world community for a <0x24>675 million dollar donation to fund strategic preparations in low-income countries, citing the importance of supporting the country that "doesn't have an available system for detecting individuals who have been infected with the virus, if it appears".
Tedros further made a statement declaring that "we are as strong as our weakest chain" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later".
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to give "the whole UN system power in response".

The virus may be on its way and you should be prepared, "urging that proper response measures are able to help the world avoid the "worst conditions".
Ryan went on to state that the current data does not allow public health workers to declare a global chemist, as a declaration means "we fundamentally accept that all humans on the face of the earth will be exposed to the virus."
On March 11, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic.
The Director-General said WHO was "deeply concerned by both the alarming level of transmission and severity, and the alarming level of inactivity".

The Chinese government has been criticised by the United States, UK Minister for Cabinet Office Michael Gove and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro for handling the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.
Several provincial-level officials from the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been fired for handling quarantines in central China, as a sign of the political organisation's dissatisfaction with the outbreak.
Some commentators believe that the move is aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party chief secretary <0x58>i Jinping from public anger from the spread of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian rejected early notices that the coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, agreeing to conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the U.S. or Italy.
The U.S. administration under Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as "China virus" or "Wuhan virus" saying that "the Chinese filter has produced a virus that is now turning into a global pandemic", which has subsequently been criticized by some critics as racist and "trying to shift the focus away from its administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast acquired a U.S. government channel outlining the ruse of communication with clear origins within the National Security Council, with the strategy being referred to as "Everything is about China.
We are informed to try and ensure these orders are disclosed in any way, including media conferences and television appearances. "Outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to virus-hit countries are part of a propaganda effort to influence the world.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geo-political component including the struggle to gain influence by twisting and 'gracious politics'".
Borrell also said "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China has also urged the United States to withdraw its sanctions from Syria, Venezuela and Iran, when it reportedly sent aid to the last two countries.
The donation of 100,000 face masks from Jack Ma to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.

This is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to send military medical forces, special decommissioning vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted "high-level political sources" anonymously as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of mistaking its "geopolitical and diplomatic charm".
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio dismissed the media reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent cargo planes with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "while offering assistance to a friend in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to retaliate if necessary."
NATO's planned "Defender 2020" military exercises in Germany, Poland and the Balkans, NATO's largest war drill since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Kate Hudson, Secretary General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, criticized Defender 2020's training: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives of not only soldiers from the U.S. and many other European countries participating but also the residents of the countries in which they operate."
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country is struggling to fight the pandemic due to lack of access to the international market as a result of the United States' sanctions on Iran. The outbreak has prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal health care, paid family leave, and higher income levels.
Political analysts expect the situation to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened as a result of the pandemic.
South Korea criticized the "indistinct and passive quarantine effort" after Japan announced anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at a site determined by the government.
South Korean society was initially unclear with President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for Moon's dismissal of what the government considers to be mishandling the pandemic, or praising his response. The pandemic has allowed the country to pass emergency laws in return.
Some commentators have voiced concerns that the move would allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections and punish those deemed to have spread misinformation about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several incidents of supply shortages, stemming from the use of equipment to fight the escalating outbreak worldwide, panic buying, and disruption to factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand as well as disruption of suppliers.
Some areas also saw panic buying that caused slippery shelves from essential items such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, causing a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to a price increase of up to twenty times the usual price and also caused a four to six-month delay in the supply of medical items.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this would endanger workers' health.
In Australia, the pandemic provides a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The activity has led to a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and has been banned by the previous Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan province, as well as the ongoing high demand for food products, both areas have survived severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy to fight the collection of goods and illicit sale of essential products have been successful, avoiding the severe food shortages that have been expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with significant agricultural production has not seen a significant reduction, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
The empty food racks are only temporary, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials are releasing pig stock to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
Damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China has been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 as a result of measures taken by the government to control the spread of the virus, and retail sales plummeted by 20.5<0x25>.
As China's mainland is a major economic and production hub, the virus outbreak has been seen to pose a threat that disrupts major stability to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economic Intelligence Unit has predicted that the market will remain downhill until a clearer image emerges of potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic collapse due to the epidemic on world growth could surpass the situation of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate from experts at the University of Washington in St. Louis puts <0x24>300<0x2B> billion into a world supply chain that can last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reported to be "harassed" after a drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 as a result of a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, as a result of growing concern about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices including NASDAQ-100, the S<0x26>P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reported its worst fall since 2008, with a Dow fall of 1,191 points, its biggest fall in a single day since the financial crisis in 2007-08.
All three indexes ended the week with a drop of more than 10<0x25>.
On February 28, the GmbH Scope Assessment confirmed China's credit rate capability, but maintained a Negative Survey.
Stocks slumped due to fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall on March 16.
A lot of people think that there will be economic downturns.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures of the central and state banks in a timely manner.
The central bank reacted faster than they did during the 2008 financial crash.
Tourism is the worst affected sector as a result of travel restrictions, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and the government's recommendation not to travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while regional airlines in British Flybe have been buried.
The impact on the cruise ship industry is at a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic happened by chance when Chunyun, a massive travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several events involving the public have been cancelled by the state and provincial governments, including the annual New Year's festival, with private companies also independently closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and parties at traditional temples.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and territories, authorities extended the New Year holiday to February 10, ordering all workplaces not to reopen until that date.
The region represents 80<0x25> of the country's GDP and 90<0x25> of exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of disease response to the highest levels and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year’s celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with a reduction in business hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40<0x25>.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers saw a 50-60<0x25> drop.
This also led to a 33-43<0x25> drop in walking traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world are implementing additional measures, e.g. improving hygiene, installing heat scanners to check visitor temperatures, and canceling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a pandemic-driven recession could cause an additional 14 to 22 million people to experience extreme poverty in Latin America compared to those in the situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the nearly 300 million migrant workers from rural China have been stranded at home in rural areas or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The 2020 coronavirus outbreak could wipe out 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32<0x25>, according to an estimate by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. The emergency in India has caused tens of millions of foreign workers in India (who are paid through daily wages) to be out of work. A survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44<0x25> of Canadian households have experienced some kind of unemployment since March. Nearly
During mid-March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany had sent their employees to a government-subsidized short-term employee scheme known as Kurzarbeit.
Short-term work compensation schemes have been implemented by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sector has been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the organisation's operations as well as those of both wage-feeding and freelance work around the world.
Art and cultural sector organizations try to enhance their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the community, and support the artist whenever possible.
As of March 202, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions have closed exhibitions, events and performances are cancelled and postponed until uncertain times.
In response, there were intensive measures to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and increasingly plummeting fall due to the pandemic was the cancellation of religious services, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology seminars, and fashion shows.
The film industry was also affected. The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of Lent of the Christian season of repentance, had been cancelled.
Many bishops have suggested older Christians sit at home instead of attending the Church Ceremony on Sundays; some churches have held church services by radio, live streaming online or television while others offer past-guide worship.
With Roman Catholic Bishops closing churches and small churches as well as St. Peter's square vacated from Christian congregations, other religious bodies also cancelled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gudwaras.
Iran's health minister announced Friday's cancellation of prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and the tombs were later closed, while Saudi Arabia blocked the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has resulted in a very significant disruption to the worldwide sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been either cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak is affecting plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will be "rescheduled to a date after 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021". Casinos and gambling locations around the world have closed as well as live poker games have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has caused many gambling feet to switch to online, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in their new registration rates. The entertainment world has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling tour concerts.
Many big theaters such as Broadway also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing works over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute and introduce their work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to jokes and entertainment in the wake of uncertainty.
Since the onset of COVID-19, increased prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hot locations in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion, and rudeness incidents have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) have recorded racist sentiments portrayed in various groups around the world saying the Chinese deserve the virus or accept what is claimed to be a fair retaliation.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Most residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their region of origin.
There is support for China, both online and offline, as well as against those in areas badly hit by the virus.
Following the development of the outbreak into a new hot region, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be victims of suspicion and xenophobaia. People in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed a lobbying petition to ban Chinese citizens from entering the country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan fence sign went viral on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported levels of racist harassment, as well as rising attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "China Virus", a term that critics regard as racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked a bus carrying Ukrainians and foreign migrants from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which shares a border with China, and studying in India's main city have reported experiencing disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak.
President of the Bharatiya Janata Party State unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese people have destroyed the environment and "that's why God has avenged their actions."
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents have been fuelled by the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign trash" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers with paid ads have issued them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make epidemic-related scientific papers available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share their results immediately on pre-printed servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods for detecting the presence of the virus as well as methods that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA coronavirus.
The test is specific and designed only to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
The test is used to confirm a very new or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests showed the number of patients who had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity of the group in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
As a result of the limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3<0x25> of their population, and there is considerable diversity in the number of tests that have been conducted across countries.
This diversity is also likely to significantly affect reported case death rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) real-time tests can be performed on respiratory samples obtained through a variety of methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests performed with a throat swab are only reliable during the first week of the disease.
Then the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to double in the lungs.
For those infected tested in the second minngu, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from the air passage in using an inhalation catheter or the material causing a cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at Charit<0xC3><0xA9> in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription of the polymerase response (rRT-PCR), and was the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom has also developed a test by January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kid, a chilionic grade (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kits. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CoV-CoV-CoV-CoV-CoV-CoV-Cost-Cost) Centers Center for Disease Prevention (C)
One in three genetic tests in the older version of the test kit resulted in uncertain results due to faulty reagents, and bottleneck tests at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples a day being successfully processed throughout February 2020;
Tests using two components were not confirmed to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and before that state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also makes COVID-19 tests available nationwide starting March 9, 2020.
No quantity limits have been announced; specimen collection and processing must be carried out according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests have been developed and produced by the VECTOR State Virology and Biotechnology Research Center.
On 11 February 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health. On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be done within 3.5 hours in high numbers, thus allowing one machine to perform about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing of Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid similarly received an EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests that use isothermal nucleic acid enlargement technology instead of PCR.
As this test does not require a series of temperature-changing cycles this method can give positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to accelerate production to send 50,000 tests a day. Tests that use monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the novel novel coronavirus nucleocapsid (N protein) protein are being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that the test can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes just as fast influenza tests.
In March 2020 a review of the writing concluded that "the chest radiograph has little diagnostic value at an early stage, while the findings of CT [computerized tomography] may have been present even before symptoms began."
Typical features of CT include multilobar bisis ground glass opacity with periphery, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleura dominance, craze openings and mergers are formed as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging features acting with the process of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for early screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infection in individuals starting 7 days or the next after symptoms begin, to determine immunity, and in population surveillance. Assessments can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or through a point-of-care (PoCT) test.
A high-contact automated system in many clinical laboratories will be able to carry out this assessment but its availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT a single specimen of peripheral blood is usually used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT a single specimen of blood is usually obtained through a puncture on the skin.
Unlike the PCR method of structuring measures are not required prior to evaluation. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provide alerts to the agency as required and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.IPada end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kit, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional PCR assessment for viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection begins. In early April, the UK found no antibody test kits purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has prepared a scheme that saw patients suspected to be able to stay at home, "an emergency department will take care of a specimen tube to a patient", they then spit into the tube, send it back and get a test result soon. NHS British has announced that it is pioneering a scheme to test a suspected case at home, which removes the risk of a patient infecting another person if they go to a hospital.
The past driving centre has helped South Korea perform among the fastest, most thorough tests than any other country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2, that they had a capacity of 12,000 tests a day in an ambulatory setting and 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
Expenses are borne by health insurance when the test is requested by a physician.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Jerrman has a total capacity of 160,000 tests a week.
As of March 19th, driving tests have been offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown, as only positive results have been reported.
A laboratory survey of the first 10,000 samples revealed up to a calendar week of 12/2020 of at least 483,295 samples of Chinese have been tested including week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9<0x25>) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Hospital Technion and Rambam developed and tested methods to test samples from 64 samplers in the same time period.
With construction monitored by BGI founder Wan Jian and taking 5 days, the model has shown the cases in Hubei will be 47<0x25> higher and the corresponding cost of handling the quarantine will double if the test capacity does not reach the target.
Wuhan's labs were quickly followed by Hou Yan's labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020 the total daily total is 50,000 tests a day. An open source, multiplex design released by Origami Assays has been released that can test as many as 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 assessments. This balanced design can be carried out in small laboratories without the need for a robotic fluid operator.
As of March, insufficient shortages and amounts of reagents have made it crowded for mass testing in the EU and in the UK and in the US.
This has prompted some authors to explore a sample preparation protocol that involves heating the sample at 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to remove the RNA genome for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was testing more of its citizens for the coronavirus per head than any other country, and was on the right path to increasing the test level to reach a large proportion of the population.
This is through the combination of past driving capabilities, and the purchase of a large-scale population-to-manufacturing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Hou-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China)
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of carrying out thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first in the world on this scale to be operated outside of China.
Different test surgeons targeting different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German method of producing kits sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German method was published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control did not exist until January 28, delaying existing tests in the U.S. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of its outbreak, and the country and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing by health experts.
On the other hand, experts say South Korea's broad willingness to conduct tests helps reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The test capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increasing testing programs as the best way to slow the pace of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus led to arrears of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of sweeps and chemical regens became limited.
In March 2020 China reported problems with accuracy on their test kits.
In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC has a “weakness;” the government subsequently issued a bureaucratic restriction that has prevented private testing. The Spanish state purchased the test kit from Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate.
The firm explains that inaccurate results may be the result of failure to collect samples or use the kit correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would retract the kit that returned the wrong results, and would replace it with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80<0x25> of the test kits purchased by the Chech Republic from China gave the wrong results. The Slovak state bought 1.2 million test kits from China which were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that the kit be dumped into the Danube.Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health told the test kit that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "use it". The UK country bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced this test kit should not be used.
The test, followed by quarantine of those tested positive and detecting those in contact with positive individuals of SARS-CoV-2 in, gave a positive result.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, the site of the first death of COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests on the entire population of nearly 3,400 people, about a ten-day interval.
Nearly half of the individuals tested positive had no symptoms, and all of the cases found were quarantined.
With travel restrictions, this has eliminated the new infection in its entirety.
With aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantines, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has been moving slower than in other developing countries, but with no firm restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and grocery stores.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun advising its citizens to stay at home on March 28, but schools will reopen in time after the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries have also controlled the pessimists by aggressively tracking contacts, entry travel restrictions, exams and quarantines, but with less aggressive emergency orders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with more test scores, relative to the number of deaths, had lower mortality rates, possibly because these countries were able to better detect those with only mild or indirect symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries with no national testing and laboratory capacity with limited experience of COVID-19 send the first five positive and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for verification tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "Positive as <0x25> test" is affected by the country test policy.
A country that only tests individuals who are admitted to hospital will get a higher positive score as a <0x25> test compared to a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, the rest is the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning a person's hands aimed at removing soil, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands consistently with soap at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the transmission of many diseases, such as diarrhea and the year, that are spread through the stool passage to the mouth.
Individuals can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
The five critical times during the day that see hand washing with soap are important include: before and after defecating, after cleaning a child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or birds.
If water and soap are not present, hand washing can be done with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning children who have used the toilet.
After blowing the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal feces.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the practice of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before handling medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important to people who handle food or work in medicine, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and lower infant mortality rates at home birth.
A 2013 study showed improved hand washing practices would lead to a small increase in the high growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates associated with respiratory disease and diarrheal disease can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, for example hand washing with soap.
This simple step can reduce the death rate due to the disease to nearly 50<0x25>.
An intervention advocating hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes by about one-third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48<0x25> reduction in diarrhoea episodes can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection (ARI), as automatic behavior is carried out in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five years old, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, infusing hand washing with soap before meals and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or medication mix, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and dying from acute respiratory infections by nearly a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation interventions as part of a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) program.
Hand washing can also protect against impetigo that is transferred through direct physical contact.
The minor adverse effect of washing your hands too often is that washing your hands too hard can lead to skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
A study from Denmark in 2012 found excessive hand washing can lead to itching, a scaly skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among healthcare workers.
Too often hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day during which hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transfer of stool to the mouth: after using the toilet (fish, peacock), after cleaning the back of the child (changing diapers), before bribing the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or birds.
Other times when proper hand washing should be practiced to prevent the transmission of diseases including before and after treatment of cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after holding trash.
Hand washing with soap is low in most countries.
In 2015, a study of hand washing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7<0x25> of households had the practice of hand washing with soap. In 2014, a study showed Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate of 23 percent. Some behavioural change methodologies now exist to increase hand washing with soap at a critical time.
The Important Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large-scale action to promote the health and education of children.
Digging twice a year, plus washing your hands daily with soap, and brushing your teeth daily with florida. is the core of this national program.
This has been done successfully in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin can be improved by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstruction in the solution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is not an efficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, are insoluble in water.
However, proper drainage helps with cleaning.
Due to its reusable nature, soap may store bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated tap soap found the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were removed when washed with foam.
The CDC site still states "liquid soaps that are released without the use of hands are better".
Antibacterial soaps get a high promotion to people who are important to health.
There is no evidence to date that using antiseptics or disinfectants is recommended to choose an antibiotic-resistant organism.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistance to strains of the organism.
So, although antibody-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective agents, this advanced formulation may contain acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and further skin conditioner (aloe vera, vitamins, bulbs, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the same antibacterial effects from the Faculty of Public Health at the University of Oregon showed that the common soap
Water does not overheat to wash hands not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, soapy warm water is more effective than soapy cold water to get rid of natural oils that have soil and bacteria.
Unlike what many people believe, scientific studies show that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial content of the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol scrubs of non-water-based hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based scrubs, antiseptic hand scrubs, or hand sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohols or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into a gel, or humectants such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohols.
By adding diluted hydrogen peroxide will further increase antimicrobial activity. A hand sanitizer containing a minimum of 60 to 95<0x25> alcohol is an efficient disinfectant.
Alcohol slicks kill bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and several viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol scrub cleaners containing 70<0x25> alcohol kill 99.97<0x25> (3.5 log reduction, equal to 35 decibel reduction) bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99<0x25> (4 to 5 log reduction) bacteria on the hands 1 minute after use. Hand cleaners are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand antiseptics or alcohol scrubs must be used to properly wet or protect both hands.
The front and back of both hands and between the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel becomes dry.
Fingertips should also be well washed, by rubbing them on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than hand sanitizer scrubs, especially when the hands look dirty.
The increased use of this agent is due to its convenient use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms. However, it cannot replace proper hand washing except when there is no soap and water.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effects of drying alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused a significant reduction in irritation and dryness of the skin compared to soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol use or additives in alcohol hand rubs are rare.
The tendency to further reduce irritant contact dermatitis becomes an attraction rather than using soap and water to wash your hands.
The non-water agent, though effective, does not clean hands from organic matter. It only disinfects.
This is why hand sanitizers are less effective than soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogen is still on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on its ingredients and formulations, and historically it has been less successful than alcohol and alcohol scrubs.
In recent times, formulations that use benzalconium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol which has been shown to decrease in effectiveness after many uses, possibly due to progressively inappropriate reactions over the skin.
Most low-income people cannot afford to have soap, instead they use ash or soil.
Ash or soil may be more effective than using water alone but may be less effective than soap.
Worries exist if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms that may increase rather than reduce disease transmission.
Ash is also a soap-like disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution if it comes into contact with water.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap if soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends proper hand washing techniques to prevent disease transmission include the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
Water flow is recommended because standing basins may be contaminated, at the same time the temperature of the water does not appear to have an effect.
Wash your hands while rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than just water.
Sentals for at least 20 seconds.
Menental creates a shift, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and thickens with longer time to remove more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
rinsing in the basin can re-suspend the hands.
Dry it with a clean towel or let it dry by air.
Wet and moist hands are easier to get dirty again. The thumbs, wrists, the part between the fingers and under the fingernails are the parts that are always overlooked.
Microorganisms may be stored in fake nails and peeled nail polish.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent the hands from becoming dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
There are a variety of inexpensive options to facilitate hand washing in the absence of tap water and/or soap, e.g. pouring water from hanging cans or pumpkins with appropriate holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. If water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions that save water such as "tippi pipes" and other inexpensive options.
A tippi pipe is a simple technology that uses a jag suspended by a rope, and a lever operated by the foot to pour a little water over the hand and a spoon of soap.
An important part of the hand cleaning process is effective hand drying, but there is debate about the most effective form of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more studies show paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in most bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towels industry, the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of hygiene when using paper towels, warm air hand dryers and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying the hands with a warm air dryer, the number of bacteria at the bottom of the fingertips was found to increase on average by 194<0x25> and on the palms by 254<0x25>.
Drying with a jet air dryer causes an average 42<0x25> increase in the number of bacteria at the bottom of the fingertips and on the palms of the hands by 15<0x25>.
After washing and drying the hands with paper towels, the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the finished end is on average reduced by up to 76<0x25> and on the palms by up to 77<0x25>. Scientists also perform tests to determine if cross-contamination is potentially occurring from users of other bathrooms and bathroom environments of each type of drying method.
The jet's air dryer, which exhales air out of the unit at an alleged speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of exhaling microorganisms from the hands and units and has the potential to contaminate users of other bathrooms and bathroom environments by up to 2 meters.
The use of a warm air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels do not show the significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different methods of hand drying.
The following changes are found in the bacterial count after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels for drying.
Hand washing using hand sanitizer wipes becomes an alternative option when traveling when there is no soap and water.
An alcoholic hand sanitizer should contain at least 60<0x25> alcohol.
Hand washing for medicine had long been an obligation when Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that warn hospital staff to wash their hands when they are forgotten.
One study found that its use can reduce the rate of infection.
Wash your hands in medicine for at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gel to brush and rub each part of your hands.
The hand needs to be rubbed together with a finger that inserts gently.
If there is dirt under the nails, a feather brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, we need to rinse them well and wipe them to dry with a clean towel.
After drying the hands, the paper towel should be used to cover the water (and open the exit if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting dirty again when they touch the surface.
Hand washing in a healthcare environment is intended to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid spreading them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that less permanent hand washing is at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching the patient, thus dispersing microorganisms.
One study showed proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a document showing how to wash and rub hands in the healthcare sector.
A guide draft on hand hygiene by this organization is also available on its website for public comment.
Relevant studies have been conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if a demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" to wash hands:
after being exposed to blood/liquid
before the aseptic function, and
after treating the patient. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (a "medicine" or "antimicrobial" soap) gives the agent a killing action.
Such an act of murder may be desirable before performing surgery or in a situation where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very widespread. To 'wash' a person's hands for surgical operations, there should be a pipe that can be turned on and off without touching with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, a sterile towel to dry the hands after washing, and another sterile brush to scrub.
All jewelry needs to be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
A long period of time (10 minutes) is not required.
During rinsing, the water in the lower arm should be prevented from flowing back into the hands.
After washing the hands, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical clothes are worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use antiseptics before and after treating the sick.
To control staffyloccal infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand washing came from the first 20<0x25> of handwashing, and very little added benefit was obtained when the frequency of hand washing increased by more than 35<0x25>.
Washing with ordinary soap produces more than three times the rate of infectious diseases transferred to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand-washing with an alcohol solution by hand-washing with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds, each shows that hand-washing with alcohol reduces bacterial contamination 26<0x25> more than antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand scrubs to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and Klostridium difficile spores than hands. Interventions to improve hygiene in a healthcare environment can involve education for staff about handwashing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand scrubs, and written and oral reminders to staff.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different health environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and essential tool for achieving good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities at home, at school and at work makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing pipes close to each private and public toilets are very rare, although there are cheap options available to build a hand washing station.
However, a low rate of hand washing can also be due to habits embedded in the lack of soap or water.
The promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioral changes of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation should be carried out.
A systematic review of 70 studies found a community-based approach to improving hand washing in LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. An example of a hand washing promotion in school is the “Three Star Approach” by UNICEP which encourages schools to take easy and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one to finally three stars,
Developing a hand-washing station can be part of a hand-washing promotion campaign undertaken to reduce illness and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to change behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted the use of hand washing emojis.
Several studies have considered the cost-effectiveness of thorough hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALY.
Yet one survey showed that promoting hand washing with soap was far more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people in vulnerable conditions such as mothers who had just given birth to children or injured soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Forence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" English.
At the time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections caused the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness about in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with the "right hand washing technique" are hung next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hand from" something, means declaring one's reluctance to take responsibility for the matter or to share involvement in it.
It is derived from the Bible verse in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands rather than the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase with more widespread use in some English communities.
In Macbeth by Shakespreare, Lady Macbeth begins compulsively washing her hands in an attempt to wash the imaginable stain, which represents her feelings of guilt regarding the crime she has committed and which she influences for her husband to commit.
It has been found that people, after recalling or reflecting back on unethical practices, tend to wash their hands more often than others and appreciate hand washing equipment more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation are less likely to engage in other payment "washing" actions, such as making voluntary work.
Religion prescribes hand washing for the purpose of hygiene and symbolic. Hand washing symbolically, by using water without soap to wash hands, is part of the hand washing ritual found in many religions including Bahai, Hindu, tevilah and nethilat yadayim beliefs in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also prescribes hand washing especially after certain actions.
Hindus, Jews and Muslims are obliged to wash their hands after using the toilet.
Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews and Muslims are also required to wash their hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazards control over COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is an application for occupational health and safety methodologies for hazard control to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control of workplace hazards depends on the workplace and work tasks, based on risk assessments of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for each employee who may be exposed to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupations with a low risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the general public and other colleagues, whose basic infection prevention measures are recommended including hand washing, encouraging employees to sit at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and maintaining routine hygiene and disinfection at work.
Jobs with moderate exposure risk include jobs that require frequent or close contact with people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but may be infected due to transmission in an ongoing community or international travel.
These include employees who have contact with the public such as at school, a working environment with a high population density, and some high-volume retail environments.
Hazardous control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures including ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing controllers, and having personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and morgues exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if employees perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or collect or operate specimens from people known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19.
Suitable hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure and self-protective equipment suitable for work tasks.
COVID-19 can have an impact on the workplace.
Workers may not be present for work because of illness, need to take care of others or fear exposure.
Trading patterns may change, both in terms of the goods requested, and how to obtain these goods (such as shopping outside peak hours or through a delivery or past-drive service).
Finally, the delivery of goods from geographical areas directly affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. The preparedness and response plans of infectious diseases can be used as a guide to protective measures.
The plan addresses the level of risk associated with various job sites and occupational tasks including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community environments, and risk factors for each employee such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the necessary controls to address such risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the pandemic.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or sub-national plan recommendations.
Objectives for response to the pandemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at high risk for severe health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the business is located affects the response taken.
Hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard control according to effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control, and the latter is self-protective equipment.
Engineering control involves separating employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to be implemented.
Administrative control is a change in work policies or procedures that require the actions of an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected on the basis of hazards to workers, properly installed according to suitability (e.g. respirator), consistently properly worn, constantly inspected, maintained and replaced, if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal job contact with the general public and other colleagues.
Recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent and thorough washing of hands, encouraging employees to sit at home if they are sick, respiratory ethics include closing when coughing and sneezing, preparing tissues and containers of waste, preparing for telework or work shifts if necessary, not encouraging employees to use other people's tools or equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection at work.
The identification and rapid isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have acute respiratory symptoms sit at home until they are free of fever, fever signs or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of a fever-reducing medication or other reversing medications, and a flexible sick leave policy, allowing employees to sit at home to care for these sick family members, and employees know about these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure risk jobs include jobs that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of an unknown person or suspected COVID-19 patient, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around a business location, or because the individual has recently traveled internationally to locations with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include occupational care workers who have contact with the public such as at school, working environments with high population density and some of the retail environment with high-volume caregivers, occupational caregivers, and occupational caregivers with caregivers, occupational caregivers with caregivers, occupational caregivers with caregivers, occupational caregivers with caregivers, occupational caregivers with caregivers, and caregivers with caregivers of caregivers.
Workers in this risk group rarely require the use of a respirator.
If a person falls ill on a plane, proper control to protect the employee and other passengers includes isolating the sick person from another person by a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew to care for the sick person, and giving face masks to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when treating a sick traveler or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biosafety bag, and the contaminated surface should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard control includes delaying travel when sick, isolating and informing the medical center on board immediately if one has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up measures should be taken in the isolation person’s cabin. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean up or disinfect if the infected person has been inside the school building regardless of community spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as canceling field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education and choir classes or dining in cafeterias, adding inter-table space, time arriving and back in stages, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is high transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school cessation can be considered. The CDC considers the relative health risks for enforcement members who perform routine activities to be low.
Law enforcement officials who must make contact with a confirmed or suspected individual with COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians including proper personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect their belts and equipment before re-use with a spray or home cleaning wipe, and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of the used PPE and for laying and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and morgues to be in a high or very high category for exposure risk.
High-risk exposed jobs include the delivery of healthcare, support, laboratories and medical transport workers exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
It poses a very high risk of exposure if employees perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or collect or operate specimens from a known or suspected COVID-19 patient.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, multiple procedures and dental examinations, or collection of invasive specimens.
High exposure risk corpse housework includes employees involved in preparing the bodies of known or suspected COVID-19 cases at the time of their death; it becomes a very high exposure risk if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for this risk group include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol production procedures are performed.
Ventilation with special negative stress may be appropriate in some health care settings and morgues.
Specimens need to be controlled with Biosafety Level 3 vigilance.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends incoming patients be isolated to different waiting places depending on whether they are suspected cases of COVID-19. In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those working within 6 feet of known, or suspected, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those performing aerosol production procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved or better N95 filter face parts respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including fit tests, exercises and medical exams.
Other types of respirators can provide higher protection and increase the comfort of employees. WHO does not recommend coverings because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not spread through body fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for entrance examination staff.
For those who collect respiratory specimens from, treat, or transport COVID-19 patients without an aerosol-producing procedure, the WHO recommends surgical masks, eye protection, or face masks, protective clothing and gloves.
If the aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirator.
As the global supply of PPE is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, by allowing only those involved in direct care to enter the room of COVID-19 patients, using only the necessary PPE for specific tasks, continuing the use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating PPE.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Lightens the burden and prepares for the future
TARIKH/HANTAGE TIME: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
COUNTRY: CC0: No rights reserved
We found ourselves in a very extraordinary state this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes our connection to the world and the responsibilities we have towards each other clear.
We don't have this kind of challenge before, but we know that our best response depends on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendships and concerns that we've seen among all our colleagues via email, phone and chat are incredible confirmations for the extraordinary human being we're lucky enough to be able to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to be your co-workers.
Last week, I shared my appreciation for their work.
This reminds me of how much the world means now when it comes to Wikipedia, and how powerful it is because this critical resource remains online and is available to all.
Your work makes all of this possible, whether you keep the website active or your colleagues paid or our community safe.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, even more so at the moment.
This is a moment that not only what we do but the way we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adapting to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the C team met last night to discuss our approach and the schedule for the days and months ahead.
In that discussion, we assume what we think will be a response to what we are up against and the best way to ensure this organization can survive at the moment.
Together, we want to eliminate stress and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to slow down a little, that's okay.
To all staff, contractors and contract workers:
We expect our daily work to be approximately 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until we are notified later.
We don't announce holidays - if you can work on a regular time, the mission can use you.
However, the world today is unpredictable. Whether you need to take care of loved ones, buy kitchen items or see a doctor, your well-being is our top priority.
We won't record your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have been told, but we told it.
No need for sick days or PTOs - just let your manager know and help your team revise calendars and schedules to ensure key areas of work are covered.
(If you've been diagnosed with COVID-19, let Bryan know in T<0x26>C Ops so that T<0x26>C can help with support and make sure your situation gets the proper attention from the management.)
Those who are paid by the hour will be paid in full.
We have already informed and reaffirmed our commitment to honour the commitments of our contractors and co-workers of staff who are paid on an hourly basis.
Each person will be paid based on their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way of channeling their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like these.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We only ask that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly.
Some of the work is considered important.
There are some things we need to keep going.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust <0x26> Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) perform critical work that may require additional assistance.
We will begin the process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is important to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus on the most important project.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We don't plan to move "twice to catch up on what's left" as soon as the pandemic passes.
You are not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are currently unrealistic.
We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and will strive to set new goals and timelines if necessary.
What happened to the APP?
In order to adjust to the actual reality and expectations of our daily working hours, we want to adjust the timeline of delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our desire to recommend an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgets to allow employees to give priority to critical work, self-care and the care of their loved ones while helping those who need or want to work with reduced working periods for the next few weeks.
The extension of the timeline greatly reduces the workload and stress of current plans throughout the organization.
We will introduce our proposal to the Board next week and will inform the representatives and team about the next steps as soon as we get confirmed.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office status, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our SF colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we have hired an antivirus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use a hospital-grade antivirus solution to infect every surface as well as the lobby and elevator system that reaches our level.
The building adopts its own maintenance duty protocol in using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be well available when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which shares the COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members based in DC.
As of last week, our D.C. office turned to far-flung supplies completely in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some NYC-based colleagues know, we're also talking about hiring a single location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked remotely for the first time.
Our long-time collaborators know that it can be an adaptation and want to give you some advice:
Limit the duration of the meeting to an additional one or two hours at most.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it for a few days.
Define the meeting clearly, have an agenda and send the reading material in advance.
Create a default video, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Have a leader to handle each meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and keep track of the list of speakers, and someone helps to take notes (or do notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headphone.
Use your well-being reimbursement for snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to chat with your colleagues about distributed tasks
The HR Operations Team is looking at an ergonomic webinar guide to support improvements in tasks distributed throughout the Foundation.
Over the past few weeks we have asked all community grant recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editathons until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We inform them that we understand our request for cancellation and other restrictions may be impossible in completing their agreed grant activities and that no one will be prosecuted for delays or alterations to those goals.
Next week we will follow up with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiment of the entire global community seems to be sadness at the disruption but is relieved at the clarity and ability to focus on their own community, Wikimedia and vice versa.
Forward, CRT strives to develop a single page about Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow through on our communication with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and take some time to connect with each other.
We're here together and we're here to help as much as we can.
For now, you can continue to search for information from this email, and all other important COVID-19-related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep all these pages updated and all the information is in one place.
We also strive to ensure regular communication with staff who are in a country that is very impressed at the moment.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that connects to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 deals with the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) associated with reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a drug that can be expected to be targeted for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc containing metaloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelium and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the M2 domain of N-terminal peptidase and the C-terminal collectible renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-path type 1 membrane protein, with its enzyme domain actively exposed on the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer domain of ACE2 cells is attached from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resultant dissolved proteins are released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is twined on the cell membrane of most alveolus type II lung cells, small intestine entrocytes, venous arteries and endothelium cells and arterial soft muscle cells in most organs.
Expression of mRNA ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE attaches the hormone I angiotensin to the narrowing of the vaso angiotensin II.
ACE2 instead attaches phenylalanine to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and its hydrolysis into angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-O).
ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]- bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the distribution of SLC6A19 neutral amino acid transporter membranes and is indicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as a major entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the cause of SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19).
In particular, binding to the nail S1 protein for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 on the belenzyme domain on ACE2 over cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into endosomes is located between cells.
The admission process also requires the infusion of S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, an inhibitor under current study as a potential therapeutic. This has led some to hypothesize that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help in fighting infection.
However, various professional associations and regulatory bodies recommend to continue with standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies.
A systematic review and meta analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a large 34<0x25> decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control."
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia is also reduced for patients treated with ACE inhibitors who are at a higher risk for pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia."
Human recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome of the affected lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the effect action (period) for 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be an expected drug for those with intolerance to the classical angiotensin renin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases surrounding angiotensin II enhanced.
The b'COVID-19 app is a mobile software application designed to help with contact tracking in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying people ("connections") who may be in contact with an infected individual.
Many applications are developed or proposed with government officials supporting in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building relationship tracking applications have already been developed.
Privacy concerns are raised, especially about systems that are based on the geographic location tracking of user applications.
Less disruptive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to log user proximity logs on other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support applications based on Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check if they have ever had contact with those infected with COVID-19.
It is used across over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is in use.
The application was developed by the local IT community, launched as an open source and will be submitted to the government. North Macedonia launched “StopCorona!”, an application based on Bluetooth to track exposure with potentially infected people and provide rapid response to health care authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracking application is at an advanced development stage, and will be available for launch in a few weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geobound applications for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and potential lack of effectiveness if application implementation is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or dangerous "coronavirus" apps, Apple sets limits for the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its Apps Store, limiting them to only "authorized" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented the same restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed their concerns about the impact of mass surveillance using the coronavirus app, particularly about whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be halted as soon as the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement asking for limits on such surveillance.
The organization has stated eight conditions on government projects:
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> the supervision shall be "lawful from the standpoint of the law, if necessary and proportionate";
the monitoring and monitoring extension shall have an embedded clause;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
Data security and confidentiality shall be protected and displayed as evidence-based protection;
digital surveillance should avoid further worsening discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
shall be protected against abuse and citizens' right to respond to abuse;
Meaningful involvement by all "relevant stakeholders" should be required, including public health experts and marginalized groups. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also released a checklist.
The Google/Apple plan proposes to address persistent surveillance problems by removing tracking mechanisms from their device's operating system as soon as they are no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking over apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have huge potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with centralized servers need to have access to private location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created that use centralized servers only for mutual communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to conduct relationship tracking.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and the merging of all of these generates notices through text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information publicly available, something that is allowed due to major changes in information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries including Germany are considering using centralized systems and privacy protection.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been published.
Tracking the relationship with privacy preservation is an organized concept with an important body of study literature dating back to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialist groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log user proximity on other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralised approach, and not a single protocol. The decentralised protocols include Centralized Privacy Preservation Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, Other Contact Event Numbers, CENs, and Protocols for Interrupting Protocols.
In this protocol, the identified personal data never leaves the device, and all the matching takes place on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or data cross-sections to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar venture is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technology that was also founded originally at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by a number of groups united on important common methods and large overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global operationality for tracking applications and alerters, an essential aspect of achieving widespread use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made open source for the BlueTrace protocol used by official government applications.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for relationship tracking that they claimed would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-preserving cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system intends to be launched in three stages:
the launch of tools to enable the government to create a privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking app
The integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android plans of Google and Apple to address implementation and ongoing surveillance problems by first distributing the system through an operating system update, and then removing it the same way as soon as the threat passes.
Repositioning a drug (also known as changing the purpose of a drug, re-profile, reassignment or therapeutic conversion) is changing the purpose of an approved drug for the treatment of a different disease or health condition from the reason it was originally developed.
This is an ongoing scientific research effort to develop a safe and effective treatment of COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and recovery plasma transfer. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 reversible proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analyzing the binding site provides an affordable project to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are proteases such as papain, RNA-dependent polymerases, helicases, S proteins and ADP ribofosphatases.

The drug is designed to inhibit HIV from mimicking by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about redirecting resources to change the purpose of the drug developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against various filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and corona-viruses.
An issue with antiviral treatment is the identification of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-experimental studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. There are several clinical trials being implemented including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate disease and another for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials currently underway for intravenous vitamin C for those hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19, two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there have been many attempts in progress to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available for less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase 1 safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The world's leading outbreaks in 2020, providing investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
It stated in April, the imperative of CEPI's initiative for accelerated vaccine development, manufacturing capacity, scaled implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platforms aiming to advance into Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Builder Phase 1 and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vectors (Phase I developers and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vectors)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials performed preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and multi-site, while determining effective dosages more accurately.
Phase III trials typically involve more participation including control groups and the effectiveness of tests on vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 are still under "praclinical" research.
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune response.

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources for supercomputer access from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have a heterologous effect, also called a nonspecific effect.
This means that they can have benefits other than the diseases they prevent.
The randomized trial in Australia aims to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
There is a possibility that the vaccine in development is not safe or effective.
Preliminary research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, suggests the need for level 3 biosafety restraint measures to handle live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no antidote or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. Moreover, there is no proven vaccine against MERS.
As MERS is widespread, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that has completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all with a virus vector vaccine, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Broadcasts on social media promoting conspiracy theories claiming the virus behind COVID-19 are known and a vaccine is available.
Patents cited by various social media releases refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure until the onset of symptoms is usually five days but may start between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 patients have recovered. The virus is particularly transmitted between humans during close contact, often through small droplets produced through coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets are produced during exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or on the surface rather than becoming an infection for a long distance.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
Viruses can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
Most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is with a real-time reverse-translational polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended to those who suspect themselves to be carrying the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the ordinary public differ, with some authorities recommend not using them, some recommend their use and others oblige their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific viral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease is recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are observed in multiple percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only data congestion and palpitations.
In some, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may be between two and 14 days.
97.5<0x25> of patients who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all who are infected show symptoms.
The role of this asymptomatic carrier in transplantation is still not fully known; however, early evidence suggests that it may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of those infected shows no known symptoms at this time and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KDCC) reporting that 20<0x25> of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic while staying in their hospitals.
China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in their daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78<0x25>) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Saliva and phlegm can carry a lot of virus burden.
It's better to talk loudly than to talk normally.
A study in Singapore found that a cough that doesn't shut its mouth can cause droplets to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although viruses are not innate, the National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transfers are likely and air collectors at positions in hallways outside people's rooms show positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to become aerosols and in turn cause congenital spread.
Although there is concern that it spreads through stool, this risk is believed to be low. Viruses are highly contagious when people are asymptomatic; although the spread is possible before the appearance of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person infects two to three people in general. The virus persists for several hours to several days on the surface.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable for a day over cardboard, up to three days over plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours over 99<0x25> copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products weaken the protective layer of viral fat, deactivate it and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical infectious agent) were less effective. In one Hong Kong study, examples of saliva were taken to the median for two days after the start of hospital admission.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel novel acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All novel features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in naturally related coronaviruses.
Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which leaks its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is almost related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the enzyme-converting enzyme angiotensin (ACE2), the most abundant in the lung's type II alveolus cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "my papa" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was found in 12<0x25> of infected people admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China and more often in severe diseases.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disease during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are involved in heart function.
High incidence of thrombosis (31<0x25>) and venous thromboembolism (25<0x25>) were found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with a weak prognosis. Autopsy of those who died from COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolus (DAD) damage, and lymphocyte invasion contains inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for epithelial cells of ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyper-inflammation.
In particular, T cells secreting pathogenic GM-CSF have been shown to correlate with the intake of monocyte inflammation secreting IL-6 and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic intrusion was also reported during an autopsy.
WHO publishes several testing protocols for diseases.
The standard method of testing is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rPT-PCR).
Tests are usually performed on breathing samples obtained with a nasopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swabs or sputum samples may also be used.
The results are generally available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used but these require two blood samples to be taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate coronavirus strains and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (possibly detecting active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) is under development but is not widely used.
China's experience with testing has shown accuracy to be only 60 to 70<0x25>.
The FDA in the United States approved the first initial care test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of the month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detection of infections based on clinical features and epidemiological risks.
The opacity of bilateral multilobar crushed glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution is common during early infection.
Dominants of the subpleura, many layers (thickness of the septum with multiple alveolus fillings) and unification may appear as the disease progresses.
Some data can be found on monoscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary unification and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity for viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytes, hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, space-inflammation with lymphocytic invasion and multinucleate giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: damage to the diffuse alveolus (DAD) with the exudate of the diffuse alveolus.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
restoring pneumonia: the formation of exudates in the cavities of the alveolus and pulmonary-space fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulant disseminated (DIC), leukoeritroblastic reagent
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, regularly washing hands with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the shoulder in the absence of tissue.
Proper hand hygiene after any coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of cloth face coverings in public places, in part to limit transfers by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups through closures of schools and workplaces, limiting travel and canceling large public gatherings.
The detention guidelines also include for the public to be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from them.
No drugs have been identified as effective in preventing COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected until at least early 2021, the main thing in managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals regularly wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating or after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It is again recommended to use alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60<0x25> alcohol but only when soap and water are not available. For areas that do not have commercial hand sanitizers, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help get rid of bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "instead of the active ingredient for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects themselves of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Excretion of the ectracorporeum membrane (ECMO) is used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its advantages are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to increase immunity.
Support treatment may be useful for those with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese Health Commission have published recommendations to care for those hospitalized with COVID-19.
Critical care experts and pulmonologists in the U.S. are collecting treatment recommendations from a variety of agencies into a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first-line use.
Caution should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare settings when implementing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals taking care of those infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Infection Isolation Room (AIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and innate precautions. The CDC provides guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment are: PPE dresses, respirators or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators (versus face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved by industry settings but the FDA already allows masks to be used under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is designed to protect against congenital particles such as dust but effective against specialized biological agents not guaranteed for off-label use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face shields or as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some percentages require it.
This type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related to respiratory failure is being actively studied for patients in hospitals with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or two-level positive airway pressure.
Whether these two provide the same benefits to people who are critically ill is unknown.
Some doctors choose to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are usually frequent in older adults (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle a sharp increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that as many as 5<0x25> were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3<0x25> needed ventilator mechanical support and 1.4<0x25> died.
In China, at least 30<0x25> of patients in hospitals with COVID-19 will eventually be admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation is becoming more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation is becoming increasingly difficult.
Ventilator is able to control pressure and high PEEP is required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on ventilators for longer.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020, and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir emerged as the most reliable.
While the new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, some drugs being tested are already approved for other uses already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends volunteers participate in trials of potential treatment effectiveness and safety. The FDA provides temporary authorization for plasma recovery as an experimental treatment in case for their lives that are serious or vulnerable.
It has not yet gone through the necessary clinical studies to show it is safe and effective for disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID.
The app can detect "close acquaintances" using surveillance data and thus the risk of potential infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also warns local health authorities. Big data analysis on cellular phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people they connect with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of those with the coronavirus.
Measures are being taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who are in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia is implementing facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian provincial health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by the mobile phone operator that "40<0x25> of people continue to move around".
The German government runs a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid called on the global for creative solutions to the coronavirus transmission.
Individuals may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, the effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession is the perfect thousand that harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease will cause a mild effect with little or no symptoms, resembling a common upper respiratory disease such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually resolve within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness take three or six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may be at high risk of getting severe COVID-19 infections based on data from the same viruses as other viruses such as SARS and MERS, but the data for COVID-19 is lacking. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs that cause pneumonia.
In most of those severely affected, COVID-19 can degenerate quickly into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications related to COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Abnormal clotting, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, has been evident in as many as 6<0x25> of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function was observed in 4<0x25> of this group.
At least 20-30<0x25> of people infected with COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospital admission and death.
In the initial case study, the median time from the initial symptom indication to death was 14 days, with a full coverage of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8<0x25> while women had a mortality rate of 1.7<0x25>.
Histopathological examination of post-mortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolous damage with exudate cellular fibromisoids in both lungs.
Changes in viral cytopathy are observed in pneumocytes.
Images of the lungs show acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8<0x25> of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, cardiac damage was observed with increased levels of troponin or cardiomycin being stopped.
According to March data from the United States, 89<0x25> of those admitted to hospitals with existing health conditions, the availability of medical and socioeconomic resources of the region may also have an impact on mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality rates from conditions vary due to their regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The low count of mild cases can lead to overestimation of the mortality rate.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by past cases of infection can mean that the death rate is overestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have at least 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than nonsmokers. Concerns have been voiced about long-term follow-up to the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20<0x25> to 30<0x25> decrease in lung capacity in some patients recovering from the disease, and a lung scan suggested organ damage.
This may also lead to the syndrome after intensive care following recovery.
As of March 2020, it is unknown if previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity in those recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but in cases with recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by positive testing for coronavirus on a reported date.
All of these cases are believed to be worse with prolonged infection than re-infection.
Viruses are considered natural and come from animals, through overflow infections.
The exact origin is unknown but as of December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest start date of symptoms as of December 1, 2019.
The official publication from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
Some measures are usually used to measure death rates.
These figures vary by region and by time and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, treatment options, the period since early transmission and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established ICD-10 emergency U07.1 disease codes for deaths from laboratory-certified SARS-CoV-2 infections and U07.2 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infections without laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically. The ratio of deaths versus cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within the given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality ratio is 6.9<0x25> (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Totals vary by region. Other measures include case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed dying from the disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics are not subject to time and according to a specific population from infection to case settlement.
While not everyone develops antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about the number of people infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7<0x25>) has died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread by Carnival parties, and transmission to younger people, causing lower mortality rates in comparison, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified as such.
Germany's health system has not been overhauled.
In the Netherlands, at least 3<0x25> may have antibodies as assessed from blood donors.
69 (0.004<0x25> of the population) were confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for both men and women.
The higher mortality rates for men in the study were carried out in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is that they are in their 50s, with the gap between men and women dominating only at 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for this sex difference are unknown but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
Immunological differences based on sex, the lack of prevalence of smoking in women and men forming joint morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57<0x25> of infected individuals are men and 72<0x25> of the total deaths due to COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked sex-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on men and women.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and they have higher exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for the time the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographic locations (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, in line with international recommendations for naming purposes to avoid stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO uses the "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial transmission in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases are commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and acute respiration disease 2019-nCoV as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in line with the 2015 guidelines on location use for diseases and virus names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers manufacture healthcare materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital requires an immediate ventilator valve, and the supplier can't deliver it in the required time scale, one engineering novice turned around locally and produced the 100 valves required overnight.
After the initial transmission of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation emerged regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread online quickly.
Humans have the ability to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of virus impersonation in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being undertaken by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated a "Solidarity Trial" to assess the effect of treatment of four current antiviral compounds with the most reliable effectiveness.
No vaccine is available but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous efforts on SARS-CoV are being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccine strategies under investigation.
First, researchers are aiming to build a vaccine for the virus as a whole.
The use of the virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to obtain immediate immune response in the human body against new infections with COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that is sensitive to the immune system in some virus subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focused on the quiescent S protein that helps the virus invade the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is a nucleic acid vaccine (a DNA or RNA vaccine, a novel technique for creating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies need to be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic codes copied from viruses that cause disease. Increased antibody dependence is proposed as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials have been evaluated as treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The purpose-built antiviral drugs cover most of China's research, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir for some countries to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates is available, as of April 2020. Several current antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combine with interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of remdesivir as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement is observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials were conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, used to treat malaria was previously studied in China in February 2020, giving early results.
However, there is a call for equal review of research.
The Korean and Chin authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, admits that double the dose is extremely dangerous and can be deadly.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of medical experts treating those infected with COVID-19. The guidelines of the 7th edition of China also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Early data suggests that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to in vitro SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for advanced in vivo studies after showing low-concentration inhibition in SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial increased protein infusion by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine together with or without azithromycin have major limitations that prevent the medical community from using this therapy without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can be a complication in the next stage of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has antisitokin storm properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing a non-random phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results with severe illness.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, this is intended to counteract those developments, which are considered to be the cause of death for some infected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonists are approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome affected by different causes, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of inactivated and concentrated antibodies produced by their immune systems that recover from COVID-19 to people who need it is being investigated as a non-vaccine method for passive immunization.
This strategy was tested on SARS with no conclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a mechanism of action in which passive antibody therapy can be an intermediate in defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as cellular cytotoxicity depend on antibodies and/or possible phagocytosis.
Another form of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced is under development.
The production of the recovery serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood from the recovered patient and contains specific antibodies to this virus can be increased for faster execution.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, later became infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the transmission of the virus.
