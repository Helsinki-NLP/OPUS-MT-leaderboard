Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are worried if they ‘look like muppets'.
There was concern among some AMs over a suggestion that their designation should have been changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/Member of Welsh Parliament).
This was due to a plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned if it can invite ridicule.
An AM working party said his group was concerned, "The designation is similar to Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirt.
A member of the assembly (AM) said that his group as a whole, felt "unhappy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but judged that this was a break from the MWP abbreviation to Muppet.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any explanation of the designation for AMs is certainly a matter for the members themselves."
The 2017 decision of the Government of Wales gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on a proposal known to gain widespread support for calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the issue of AM designations, the Commission preferred WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members), but the MWP option gained the most support on public consultations.
AMs seem to be proposing alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could distract the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over the bill in a matter of weeks.
These reform laws will include other changes to the workings of the assembly, including disqualification rules for AMs and the drafting of committee systems.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians go to vote on referendum on country name change
The voters will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "The Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was held in an effort to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor indicates a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected EU and NATO membership offers.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the vote for the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was a price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin did not ring when the churches in Harlem were in trouble.
“Historically, the old people I talked to said there used to be a bar and a church in every corner,” Adam said.
“Today, there is no one.”
He said that the disappearance of all these bars was understandable.
“People socialize in other ways” now, he says.
"The bar is no longer the living room of the surrounding community where people visit it regularly."
As well as the church, he was concerned that the money from the asset sale would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would be back from scratch."
Churches, he added, could have been replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not help keep the remaining shrines in the vicinity.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white people," he said, "and therefore will speed up the day that these churches close simultaneously because it is unlikely that people who move to these condominiums will be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
Native white Methodist churches moved in the 1930s.
Black churches that have been worshipping in the surrounding area have taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation under Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of retail merchants on the 125th street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused the building to be heavily damaged, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild, they built the tower bell.
Reverend David Johnson, Son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in St. Martin proudly called the tower's bell "the bell of the poor"
An expert who rang the tower bell in July gave him another designation: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable instrument of history."
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the world's first tower bell played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind who switched to ringing the larger tower bells at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened at Saint Martin in recent months is an elaborate story of architecture and contractors, some carried by lay church leaders, and others carried by episcopal dioceses.
The vestry - the governing body of the diocese, formed from lay leaders - wrote a letter to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "would seek to charge a fee" on the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency from the diocese.
Shark injured 13-year-old in lobster diving in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he was diving to catch a lobster in California during the opening of the lobster season, an official said.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then rowing in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just an overflow of excitement after catching the lobster, but then he "realized" that the boy was yelling, 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
His entire collarbone was torn," Hammel said that he realized it when he had grabbed the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coast Rescue Captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim sustained severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Authorities blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles is aware that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan to break the British beauty market
Sainsbury took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with convenience store-style beauty stalls run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial boost to the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion British beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion products and household appliances decline, larger beauty stalls will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if it proves to be successful.
Investment in beauty became a hunting ground for the supermarket to make use of the shelves that used to be a place to display TV, microwave, and household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double its beauty offerings to reach 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of brands starting from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also gain more space with branded areas such as those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup suite so that most of its products will be vegan-friendly – something young shoppers are increasingly in demand.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon. South London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the switching of buying daily food necessities in small amounts at local grocery stores means that the supermarket has to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, has said that the outlets will look more like Malls as supermarket chains try to counter pressurers like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and no-food services.
Sainsbury has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat outlets since they bought the two franchises two years ago, which he said had supported daily groceries sales and made more lucrative acquisitions.
Previous supermarket attempts to renovate beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to divide the profits from the chemical store in the supermarket.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical store businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical franchise, worth <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan, adding luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel on beauty stalls to improve the atmosphere for the sake of our visitors.
We also invest in well-trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed so that it fits all needs, an alluring environment and a comfortable location signals that we are now an alluring destination challenging the old fashioned way of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘gears’ after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left ‘with rage' after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle business deal to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby had no time to manage the trademark of their household appliances and accessories, Truly.
The couple’s business is equated with Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning host, aged 37, used her Instagram account to announce that she was out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons' Den star, Petes Jones angry by withdrawing at the last moment, from their lucrative branded lifestyle business - to focus on her larger contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources state that Jones was so "rugged" when the TV gold girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to the home appliances and accessories trademark, Truly.
Their business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune by <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation homes,
A source said: "Truly is by far Holly's most important priority.
It would be his long-term future, which would keep him alive for decades to come.
His decision to step down left everyone involved in shock.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to launch time.
There's a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain’s most expensive stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to huge investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home appliances, as well as potential further launch delays.
And this can mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby founded True along with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on this business relationship."
Talking seriously ‘and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for making comments that some deemed "unprecedential" and had been very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a voice mocking his “news reader.”
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He learned that Kim was keen to meet a second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a step forward for the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders in. The UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "appropriate response" from the United States to the initial North Korean disarmament movement.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure under control.
Trump looks more optimistic in his series.
"We are doing our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He said that his success in improving relations with Kim had brought positive results - stopping rocket experiments, helping to free the hostages and repatriating the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unorthodox approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d better have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Island, Killing Hundreds
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population is homeless, there is no national disaster statement, as a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so this is a bit challenging," said Subung.
While Save The Children is putting together a team to leave for Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to aid.
Given the continuous earth shaking experienced by Indonesia, the country is still very unprepared to face the fury of nature.
While a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although warnings have been reported, is likely to have contributed to casualties.
At the best of times, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The floating hospital that has been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made repairs to Indonesia’s damaged infrastructure the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of highways and railroads.
But a lack of funds has disrupted Mr. Joko’s government while he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes as Muslim and Christian hordes fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge puts on equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat against Chelsea in the Premier League by one score in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from outside Chelsea's goal when his side were 1-0 down.
He placed the ball on his left side before kicking it towards a distant pole.
The ball soars high over goal as the ball soars to the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and take one chance and not think about it too much, and just do a kick.
Chelsea took the lead 1-0 in the first half after Belgian flagship Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker gave feedback to Mateo Kovacic on the game, before spinning near midfield and running fast into the centre of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gave the pass and ran in midfield.
He then did the perfect kick, leading Hazard towards goal.
Hazard managed to pass the opponent's defender and kick the ball into the corner with a left-footed kick, past Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the state disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the wreckage of buildings destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and triggered waves as high as 20 feet, Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, is filled with collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has been carried out after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John's street, at 7.55 a.m. with several stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was detained on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people around who saw or heard something to come face to face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I ask everyone around John's street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard camera to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt confident that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing as police have said, they are in the process of notifying the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just returned to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man couldn’t say anything when he found out what was happening.
Residents are currently being told that it will take several hours until they are allowed to re-enter.
A police officer was heard telling someone that all areas were now being enacted as scenes of the crime.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
He always repeats ‘this is terrible’.
At 2 p.m. two police vans were in line and the other was outside.
A number of officers were standing in line to monitor apartment blocks.
Anyone with information is required to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCc, phone 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing log 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's Parliament statue became the last memorial to be affected by 'historical rewriting'
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the destruction of the Talibans to many British cultural and religious artifacts carried out by fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "This is inevitable in the current debate about the destruction of the statues, that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the palace of Westminster will be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the British civil war was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong descendants of Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The remarkable representation of Cromwell from Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to a 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is still worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more by the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course the kingdom.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation, is still the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century had shaped the next development of the nation, and Cromwell was an individually recognizable figure representing one side of the difference.
His success as Lord Protector also deserves to be celebrated and commemorated."
Pig Killer Persecuted Chinese Farmer to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pig stable in the Liupanshui area market of Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have left with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin finds him dead, and sees the door of a nearby pig stable has been opened.
He said that in a pig's stable there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the 550-pound male pig had persecuted the farmer to death, according to reports.
"My cousin's calf was bleeding and crushed," the cousin, known by the surname "Wu", was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks against humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife frightened him and drove him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the scent of blood could act as a "trigger".
"They're just playing.
They're biters, very curious... they're not gonna come out to hurt you.
You just have to give him enough respect,” he said.
The remnants of storm Rosa brought torrential rains extending into the southwestern United States.
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will cause flooding rains across the northern and southwestern regions of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, Category 1, Hurricane 1, starting at 5 a.m. Sunday time of the Eastern Region, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Trench began to form over the Pacific Ocean and moved east, towards the U.S. West Coast, as Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push tropical humidity north to southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity interacting with the approaching troughs will create heavy rainfall that expands in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flash flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause rainfall levels to close to 2 to 3 inches per hour at some point, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected to fall in some parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Flash flooding is likely to occur with conditions that deteriorate rapidly due to the nature of scattered tropical rains.
It is not advisable to explore the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause ravines to become vicious rivers and storms will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching trough will cause local heavy rainfall to part of the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall exceeding half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to become slippery.
This will be the first rainfall in the region in their rainy season.
Some of the scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before the rains become more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will extend to the four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some great temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
There were precise examples of dramatic temperature differences along central U.S. territory on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will form and again spread.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. territory is expected to warm up starting in October with a speed spread of 80s from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be around 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high chance for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. to mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an intriguing statement on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular events to report on Friday’s last-minute unexpected events: A deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was groping her body drunk and trying to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure that was not the case.
There are likely more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, having watched it.
The company calculated average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for other networks broadcasting this was not available quickly, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty in counting the number of people who watch it in the office.
To put this in perspective, it is the same number of viewers as a football playoff game or Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose host opinion strongly supports Kavanaugh's appointment, excelled over all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million viewers and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Fans remained high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being shouted by protesters as he tried to board an elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was taunted, broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think that he is telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power when there are many helpless women."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there was a lot more he needed to say in the committee hearing.
Cable TV and broadcast networks all covered live a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy throughout the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with an understanding that the FBI would examine the charges against the candidate over the next week, as the minority Democrats have requested.
Flake has been convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, as it is clear that the Republican party will not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of ‘playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests, over her plans to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews that featured him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that proposals about the UK and EU having to collect tariffs on each other were "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspect in LSU player's death.
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and in prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the item, a WAFB CBS affiliate reported.
After interrogating Simpson, police said he claimed to have committed the fatal shooting of Wayde.
His contract has been set at <0x24>350,000, the Advocate reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and surrounding residents in assisting the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area's law enforcement for "persistence and the quest for justice."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
With a height of 6.6 feet lived in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and soared to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano spewing ash in Mexico City
The ash coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern area around the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in more than 24 hours.
The center monitored several times the rumbling and vibration.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash attached to the windshield of a car in the vicinity of Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity on the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude quake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of independence elections.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after participants of pro-independence demonstrations clashed with riot police, and when thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by riot police hurled eggs at them and threw powder paint, creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
The dispute also occurred later that day with police using their sticks to control the dispute.
For several hours pro-independence groups chanted "No forget, no pardon" confronted union protesters who shouted, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the protest, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in this independent-oriented region, a year after the October 1 referendum which was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters prefer to be independent, despite low voter turnout with those opposed to secession and largely boycotting the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in TPS across the region in fierce clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support the national police.
The demonstrations continued but were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy because they were able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a slight victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders, either in exile or in custody awaiting trial, for their role in organizing a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with her mobile phone in support of police, said the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more stressful now," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed pre-trial since the end of last year, announced that he would run for European Parliament next year.
“Standing up as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the setbacks in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage occurred to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may have also been fired towards the car at some point.
The goal scored by Menga has given Livingston a win over the Rangers by 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston's victory resulted in the Rangers sacking Steven Gerrard from his position as club manager of Ibrox, in his second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack has proved to be a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is on par with Hibernian's second.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face Hearts leaders who are eight points ahead of them next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten record in the division to six games, while head coach Holt is still clinching defeats since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed chances against a careless guest team
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, with their precision giving the Rangers various difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his attempt missed across the face, then Alan Lithgow could only widen his effort after sliding in and faced Craig Halkett's header from across the wicket.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play superior in the beginning, knowing that they could make it difficult for the team to come up with a dead ball.
And that’s the way to come up with a very important goal.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in to help Menga, who got a turn and scored from the middle of the pitch.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the mastery but realized that the home defence was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly as a whole was undisturbed.
That pattern continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to lure the rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was knocked out by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow was knocked out by another Livingston game.
Attacks continued to come into Livingston's goal and were constantly avoided, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were rejected.
‘Fenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
For a man, they are incredible, continuing to exceed expectations on this ever-increasing trajectory.
Their playing style and personnel have hardly changed since they returned to the top flight, but big credit must be given to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert during the game.
Nevertheless, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was poor – only once they could break the home side formation – and it was a warning to the Rangers, who were aware of their presence in the middle of the pitch.
Erdogan received mixed reception in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue sky stretch on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They are at odds on issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to deter a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also voiced, denouncing both, Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The protests depicted opposition to the existence of an immigrant who was welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and denounced as a dictator by others.
Collision on Deptford highway: Cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a bustling street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car had stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a runaway crash on Childers Street, about 1 mile away from Saturday's collision.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and alerted his family.
Roads were closed and bus lane diversions had been imposed and motorists were urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Chaos
Six wardens were injured in a riot in a heavily guarded man’s prison, the police office said.
Chaos arose at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST (GMT<0x2B>0100) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been deployed to deal with the riots, which involved eight detainees and occurred on one side of the building.
Officers were treated at the scene due to minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained rapist officers have been deployed to deal with the incident that is taking place at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that the responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend longer behind bars.”
The HMP Long Lartin prison houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the prison chief was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year riot officials were called to prison to deal with a serious riot where a police officer was attacked with a billiard ball.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with Flooding (Drought Areas May Benefit)
The tropical depression that hit Arizona is rare, but that's what's likely to happen early next week as the remaining traces of energy by Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwestern desert pose a risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly past Phoenix on Tuesday, hitting Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that there were only "ten tropical hurricanes capable of causing tropical storms or depression status within the 200 miles of the Phoenix region since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border region."
The latest Hurricane Center Device is able to predict 2 to 4 inches of isolated rainfall that reaches 6 inches at Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rockies and Great Basin are most likely to be exposed 1 to 2 inches, with possible amounts of isolation reaching 4 inches.
For those in flash flood-free areas, the Rosa rains may be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwest region is currently hit by drought.
According to U.S. drought observers, only about 40 percent of Arizona has experienced at least extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the path through Hurricane Rosa leads to land across Baja California on the Mexican peninsula.
Rosa, still at storm power on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles northward from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm met with cooler waters in the Pacific and was therefore weakening its strength.
As such, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall may be high in parts of Mexico, posing a high risk of flooding
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected to hit the Baja California region up to the southwestern region of Sonora, likely up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then cross northern parts of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will cross through Arizona and into southern Utah at midnight Tuesday.
"The main risk that storm Rosa or its remnants may pose is very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern regions of Sonora, and the U.S. southwestern regions of the U.S. desert." the National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated.
The rain is expected to cause the threat of flash floods and debris of buildings flowing into the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Arrest of four suspects attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton area, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas, police said.
The officer has urged anyone who may have video footage of the incident on his phone to come and report.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘accepts hatred and anger' from Democrats
“One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and humiliating tactics,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Wheeling, western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "received hatred and anger" from Democrats during the nomination process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcibly and emotionally denying a charge from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's intelligence and quality and courage on that day.
"One vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm someone who has the most perfect legal thinking of our time, a jury with a true track record of public servants," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when talking about the importance of Republican participation in mid-elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m really racing,” he said.
“That’s why I came here, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "fight and block."
The first voting procedure at the Senate level in Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place by the latest Friday, a senior GOP leader's aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by Indonesia earthquake, tsunami, with the death toll rising
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away as giant waves hit the coast, as a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when six-metre (18 ft) high waves smashed the beach at dusk, causing many deaths and destroying everything it passed through.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat increased yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away so they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) said at a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it was dragging cars, wood, houses, hitting everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed through the high seas at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Air photos released by BNPB showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges twisted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Successive aftershocks rocked the city along the coast on Saturday.
The quake was felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy expended in Friday's massive quake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb detonation that was dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, can enlarge the size of a tsunami, it can be said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under the wreckage of the destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could have been greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "is completely paralyzed by the absence of information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its members and volunteers were heading towards the disaster-affected region.
“It’s a tragedy, but it could get worse,” he said.
The relevant agency on Saturday received much criticism for not informing that there was a tsunami hitting Palu, although authorities said the wave was already raging at the time the warning was issued.
An amateur footage shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of a building chanting a panicked warning of a tsunami approaching, toward the people on the streets below.
Within minutes the water rolls hit the beach, flooding buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately prove the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami were the biggest cause of power outages that cut communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun delivering cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the refugees are in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The airport has been reopened only to channel relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit an evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll of the Indonesian Tsunami has risen to over 800.
That's awful.
When World Vision employees from Donggala made it safely to the city of Palu, where they were sheltered in tarpaulin tents built in their office yards, on their way through devastated areas, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
That's terrible.
Even as relief groups began to move slowly to start disaster management activities, some of the groups complained of restrictions on skilled foreign volunteers, who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and energy assistance from abroad can only begin to be channelled if the disaster-affected area has been officially declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the time the Government said, OK, this is a national disaster," we were able to receive international aid, but there was no such status.
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing survivors still hope that their loved ones will be part of a miracle that will fix the grim storyline of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of the closet.
On Sunday, rescuers took out a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days with the mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has been the coach for the two missing paragliding athletes, who had taken part in the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those who are still trapped in the Hotel Roa-Roa, along with Mr. Mandagi, are his students.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my personal emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recounted how after news of the devastated Roa-Roa Hotel circulated around the paragliding community, he desperately sent a WhatsApp message to Palu competitors, who took part in the celebrations on the beach.
All the messages, however, received only one gray check mark, instead of two blue checks.
"I think that means the message is not being sent," he said.
Robbers pick up <0x24>26,750 during ATM charging in Newport in Levee
The robber on Friday morning stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink employee who was recharging an ATM storage box in Newport, according to the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was at work, another man "run from behind Brink workers" and stole one bag containing money to be sent.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to reports, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity can contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former was formally known as Kanye West."
West, aged 41, has had the nickname Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes were made prior to her appearance on Saturday Night Live, as she was expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform at the show, which was cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creators said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, previously West said that for him the word had a religious meaning.
“I believe ‘yes’ is a word commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with radio broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, that name is us.
The name is taken from Kanye, which means the only one, being Ye - as a mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our true self."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known in various ways as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator JAY-Z also made it with or without a hyphen and a Big letter.
Mexico’s president, AMLO, vowed not to use the military in the face of civil society
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians ahead of the 50th anniversary of a bloody counter-attack against students.
Lopez Obrador promised a day on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to pressure the Mexican people."
The army launched a fire at peaceful demonstrations in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, as left-wing students' movements planted their roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for Mexican youth by providing monthly subsidies to those who are in college and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should have doubled A.I. funding.
As China is more active in terms of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funds it will use for research in the field, said investor and practitioner A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who already works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. as a whole lacked formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: aiming to be number 1 in AI innovations by 2030.
“Doubting AI research funds is a good start, considering all other countries are likely to lag far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next major AI milestone will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview on Sunday.
Lea, the owner of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who is already investing in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beat the best American Othello players, and after that he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch of China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge for the Advanced Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win prizes from the Government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking the academic lead; it’s the company,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring figures from universities for AI research in recent years.
Lee said that a change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. support efforts around AI.
“I think green cards can be offered automatically for PhD degree holders in the field of AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued a Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding for people in academic institutions just as the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organizations are distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic assignments is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the Selection Committee for Artificial Intelligence formation.
And this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, DARPA recently invested more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation calling for the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has seen no follow-up for months.
Macedonians vote in order to change country name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide the country's name change to "the Republic of North Macedonia," an action that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has banned its offer of membership to be part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the opinion that the name of its northern neighbor represents the recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a new proposed name, but the nationalist opposition argued that the change would damage the identity of most of the Macedonian ethnic Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not cast his ballot at the election and a boycott campaign had instilled doubts as to whether the election results could reach the minimum of 50 percent of the votes required for the election results to be declared valid.
The question on the ballot read: "Do you agree to NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price that deserves to be paid for access to bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born from the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the sake of the young generations of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough lawmakers say they will abide by the vote to make a decision.
The name change requires a two-thirds vote in parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, the result was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters gave their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko gave their ballots for elections in Macedonia in order to change the country's name which would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov had already prepared a small stage and pulled seats in front of tents made by those who would boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we wanted to join honorably, not through the door of the waiter," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most of the population will approve because more than 80 percent of our people support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his ballot.
He said the "yes" result would be "confirmation of our future."
An opinion poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the required amount.
Another poll, hosted by Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the vote to be successful, it takes 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure in the vote would represent the first rejection of policy against pro-Western governments since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero scoured Brighton’s entire defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton defenders in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received an passe in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He ran among the three defenders of Brighton, before recklessly entering the open field.
Aguero later found himself surrounded by four green sweaters.
He twisted past one defender before running ahead of several more opponents at the end of Brighton's goal.
Then he passed to his left, to Sterling.
The England forward made use of his first kick from goal to pass the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of goal.
“Aguero is struggling with some problems on his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the City manager, told reporters.
“We’re talking about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, deep inside Brighton's territory on that game.
He passed the ball with a stunning away kick through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a bit of a kick of the ball before leading Sterling to the farthest post.
Sky Blue's forward midfielder dribbled towards goal just before the ball slid out of the border.

Scherzer wants to fight spoiler versus Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no more reason to impose another match.
But the overly competitive Scherzer hopes to outperform the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, who are ahead in one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned a spot after winning a wild-card game against the Nationals by 5-2 on Friday night, but are still trying to earn their first division title.
“Although we played without winning, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams that will compete at the highest level from any point I may face this year.
How could I not want to compete in a match like that?”
The Nationals have not announced the opening game for Sunday, but it is reported that under such circumstances, they are likely to let Scherzer play.
Scherzer, who will start the game for the 34th time, held a training session on Thursday and started Sunday’s game that is usually used for rest.
Washington's right-handed pitcher was a scorer of 18-7 with a run average (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in this 220 2/3 inning session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to the situation in which his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the middle of the election.
"Every effort we have made is at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election of our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting all over the place for incredible candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see a radical Democrat who is very, very horrifying, you can see it happening right now.
And they decide to take back power by any means, you see the evil, their abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to fight to gain power and control, that’s what they want, that’s power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen that for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "anger and evil and vile and unbelievable."
She referred to the Senate's Dianne Feinstein serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee by naming her name, which was greeted with harsh insults from her listeners.
"Remember what the answer is?
Have you leaked those documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for him - it's very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a public service place.
Now be intolerant of anyone who expresses his thoughts.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn myself, it was no surprise.
After all, I was in the last order of Members of Parliament, who were told that our attendance was not expected – all because we expressed our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she defended antisemitism firmly.
In my case, the denunciation movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, in Europe, the issue is ironically the same as that which Jeremy Corbyn opposed with previous leaders.
The notice for the East Nottingham workers' meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, meeting the General Committee on Friday Night exactly that way.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises regarding politics that are "better, more friendly" has not long been forgotten, if, indeed, it ever began.
Differences in opinion in the working party are becoming more and more intolerable and every opinion is judged worthy by the authority of the party.
It began as soon as Jeremy became leader, as a colleague who I thought I would share the same political views, beginning to expect me to go back and accept a position that I would never have accepted - in both the national security and the EU single market.
Whenever I speak openly – and no matter what I say – then there will be a mockery on social media that calls for the cancellation of appointments, denouncing central politics, telling me I shouldn’t have served in the Labour party.
And it wasn’t just me who experienced it.
Sure, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual abuse or racism on a daily basis but never dodge.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current political era is how the level of abuse has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party was supposed to help develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer on the broader church and with each motion "not confident" or change the selection of party rules to be more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that encouraged me to keep my head down, not to overly express my opinion, and then I would say "Okay."
But I’m not going into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by the abandonment of Thatcher's government that resulted in my comprehensive school class literally collapsing, I have been trying to fight for better public services for those most in need of it - both as a local counselor and a minister in government.
I never concealed my political actions, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my policy position and the things I do not agree with in the current leadership.
For those who advocate a motion on Friday, all I can say is that when the country moves fast toward the split of sovereignty, it will jeopardize our state business and public services, I don’t want to waste time and energy for loyalty to the leader of the Labour party.
But really, one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, as a Labour party member or not. I am proud to serve you and I promise that there is no threat of resignation or any political policy that will prevent me from doing what I believe is in your best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr rises to the top
The last two tries may have cheated slightly on the final result, but there’s no doubt Ayr deserved to win a very entertaining Tennent’s Premiership match today.
Now they were at the top, the only undefeated party out of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and ability to grab the best chances, got the home team and coach Peter Murchie the right to feel good.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still unbeaten so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The awards for Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given on that game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Baggot sniffed an unconverted try.
Climo loosened Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, he scored then did a single try to make Ayr's score to 17-5 at rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try changed by Baggot, reducing the odds to five points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruaridh Knott had a serious injury, was pulled out, and since the restart of the game, Ayr went faster than Stafford McDowall's attempts, changed by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then exposed to a yellow card and again, Melrose made a spare player pay with Bruce Colvine's unchanged try, at the end of the hard pressure.
The hosts had returned to play, however, by the time Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for clomo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind the forward injured Ayr.
Climo was replaced, as was the case again, almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe kicked the goal and thwarted the fifth attempt of the goalkeeper Gregor Henry.
Still Game star looks ready for his new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Kieran appears ready to move into the service industry after it was revealed that he was crowned director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he directed and also starred alongside his old comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple have already announced that the upcoming ninth series is the final episode, and apparently Kiernan plans to guide a live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was trying to get involved in "a thriving restaurant business in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours: Bolivia surrounded by land is hoping that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific.
Sailors patrol at the headquarters of the Launch Force located in La Paz.
The public building raised a blue sea flag.
The Naval Base from Titicaca to the Amazon was polished with the motto: "The sea is our legitimate property.
To rise again is an obligation.”
Passing through Bolivia surrounded by land, the memories of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict are still vivid — like a desire to once again traverse the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is likely to peak in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and certainly positive expectations about the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ trial on screen across the country, hoping that a court in The Hague will support Bolivia’s demands that — after decades of tense negotiations — Chile be obliged to negotiate guarantees of Bolivia’s sovereignty over the ocean.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial war for next year's re-election - also has much support at Monday's trial.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific Ocean," he vowed in late August.
But some analysts are convinced that the court is unlikely to decide on Bolivia’s wishes – and that it will only change little if it is possible.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to hand over Chilean territory, and has already determined that it will not decide the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the ICJ's ruling comes just six months after final arguments have been heard, indicating the case is "not complex," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international law expert.
And far from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years it may have been a setback.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric is already undermining the good will of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point remain in negotiations, but it will be very difficult to remain in discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian government's deputy in The Hague rejected the idea of quick decision-making.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual gain," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales—still one of Latin America's most famous presidents—used maritime issues as a political supporter.
“Bolivia will never relinquish its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
"The conference is an opportunity to see if we need to solve the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never disarm nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned that the United States was implementing the deal made at a meeting in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was seen almost starting a deadlocked nuclear diplomacy for more than three months after a meeting with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was only a "false dream" that by continuing U.S. sanctions and refusal to declare a Korean War settlement would lead North Korea to surrender.
Washington is on guard to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang making efforts to curb the armed forces first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the recognition of an arsenal that for the country is the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris fashion shows showcase the latest collection of head coverings to the main street near you
If you want to multiply the collection of hats or really want to be protected from the sun don’t look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne put out a series of large-sized head coverings for their SS19 collection on the stage of a fashion show in stunning style held at Paris Fashion Week.
The really impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have been showcasing eye-catching creations on the show stage.
What stands out from Valentino is a beige-coloured hat on top decorated with a wide edge of a feather tub that covers the model’s head.
Large-size accessories include diamond-decorated watermelon, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also shows a collection of strange masks—and right before Halloween.
Many masks of different colors have been sewn and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
A creation similar to a scuba diving kit is equipped with snorkels and glasses, while others look like melted ice cream.
And if you keep browsing through those big fashion collections – then you’re in luck.
Fashion observers predict that the large collection of hats will be marketed to the main street near you.
The big-sized hats became a very best-selling trend in ‘La Bomba', a straw hat with a two-legged fringe seen worn by everyone including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label veneration behind the very impractical splash from social media made a huge creation on the beach catwalks of straw that was about the size of a swimsuit - worn with a sling model.
The burnt orange rafia bag, clipped with rafia on the edges with white leather handle straps, is a standout from the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see the big hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for next summer - as designers are already making a huge impact, it will be hard to ignore the demand for such big accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with outstanding exam results, further reinforced by each student and collective success in sports, arts, music as well as hard work.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Board of Private Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best service for students and parents.
The independent school aims to prepare its students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement school curriculums as expected, we see modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable choice subject in many schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, your speech goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, your words will come to his heart.”
It’s a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s latest exam, we can see that language is the top position of the league table with the highest graduation scores in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language get an A Plus grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students received an A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent who learned Spanish also received an A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important skill that children and adolescents will need in the future.
Today the languages, as a choice of subjects, are held in the same standard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Service in 2014 found that from several reasons why employers should continue to struggle to fill vacancies, 17 percent of the reason is a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teenagers for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language proficiency, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever a person’s career choice, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will feel the real benefits of having this kind of lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of foreign countries will automatically make a multilingual superior in the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French became the only language spoken in double-digit percentage, which was 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for today’s children is important for now.
Having multilingual skills, especially the language of countries with developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the language considered the most important in the UK for the next few years, i.e. 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are aimed at providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
It is undeniable that today, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining a country’s future, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scottish teens.
Il fait bien le juste.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent School Board.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not been determined how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play just a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to do pre-season matches to be ready," he said.
Trump General Meeting Schedule in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began a rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five rallyes scheduled for next week, including stops at some of the fun places that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was confirmed that the vote was delayed in order for him to vote for the Supreme Court's office, Trump intends to build support for him for the upcoming half-term elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote takes place in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's general meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearing for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is increasingly tense after allegations of sexual misconduct and estimates the Senate vote will be delayed by up to a week while the FBI investigates it.
But the main goal of the rally's agenda is to help Republicans gain some momentum in the face of November's general election.
Therefore, in President Trump’s campaign it was mentioned that five rallying this week aims to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will as many as possible travel to the states as we face a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight’s rally is expected to present supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as draw coverage from Pittsburgh media,” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican West Virginia Senate candidate left behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey so the president should come as an attempt to increase his earnings in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. teams show courage to defend their hopes in Sunday's singles match
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursome sessions are all that may be required in this Ryder Cup.
The momentum pendulum swing is a sporting concept that is the result of the findings that players fully trust, and nothing exceeds that in competitions like this.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
“Before, they were six points clear and now they are four, so I think we think of it as a bit of momentum,” said Jordan Spieth.
Of course Europe has the advantage of being four points clear with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, felt they had a bit of momentum and they had a lot of passion, no exception to the Spieth and Justin Thomas formations that played together all day and each boasted three out of four points.
Spieth has played lethally from the tee area to the green area and leads by example.
The screams of the celebration grew louder as his turn came, making a crucial putting blow to make the match a draw as he and Thomas lost two against two.
The putting blow from him that won them on the number 15 was met with similar screams, screams that let you know he was sure America was not losing.
“You really have to try harder and worry about your own games,” Spieth said.
All these players are gone now.
18 holes that need to be marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
The unique but attractive pair of Europe is four to four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seemed to flow both to and from this tumultuous crowd that convinced them that they were players to be defeated on Sunday, and no player more famous than Fleetwood or Molinari would lock the potential of European victories at sunset over Le Golf National.
It is better if at the same time the two are placed in different holes.
However, it’s still too early to talk about Europe’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shortened the work of Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine are like digging holes that this Spanish and Swedish golfer could never climb.
Although, on Sunday no one can help you out of the hole.
Fourball and Foursome are great shows to take a closer look at because of the interaction between the pair, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how the strategy can change instantly.
So far, Europe played better as a team and took the lead quite far towards the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the U.S. team had the guts to play despite some doubts, especially in the United States.
Europe lead 10-6 on last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of the final day of the Ryder Cup after bouncing back from Saturday’s fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to record their points so far at Le Golf National by four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to retain a trophy that Hazeltine didn’t have two years ago, dominated the American side who were wrongly targeted in the morning’s fourball, making the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in the foursome, winning two games, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team need eight points from Sunday’s 12-game singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debutant to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points from their opening four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball they became very solid to defeat Woods who batted and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau more firmly 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, has occasionally appeared brilliant but has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourball and foursome and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting on morning fourball, then returned to pair with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2<0x26>1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three worlds.
Europe did not achieve it on its own despite a fun and windy day in southwestern Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for America by two points on Saturday.
They got an interesting 2<0x26>1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in fourball then returned again to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4<0x26>3 in foursome after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history where a team returned from a four-point deficit into a single game, although as defending champions the Furyk team only needed a series point to retain the trophy.
However, after being second best for two days, Sunday’s counterattack looked like it would surpass them.
North Korea says it is "impossible" to unilaterally disarm without trust
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations that sanctions are constantly deepening their distrust of the United States and it is unlikely that the country will unilaterally disarm its nuclear possessions in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and pledging not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it would be impossible for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated similar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization where North Korea would be punished for taking gradual steps, he made a significant statement that they were not rejecting completely as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between U.S. presidential officials and the new North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, at which time Kim pledged to seek "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has wanted an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by imposing semi-sanctions to achieve their objectives by force, and even rejects "the final declaration of war," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us bend our knees is an illusion of people who don’t know about us.
But the problem is that these persistent sanctions will deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by U.S. leaders at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the troubled side in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not reach this kind of deadlock."
However, Ri’s tone was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke to the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s rockets on the U.S. mainland was inevitable after Trump’s “Devil President” called Kim “a rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at a U.N. meeting, Trump, who last year threatened to "destroy" North Korea altogether, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but that huge work remains to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If this takes two years, three years or five months - no problem", he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue firmly and should not fail until we know that the denuclearization is complete, final and verified."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to halt financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there had actually been progress, only that North Korea within a matter of hours struck that he made "gangster-like demands."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the site of the missile as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate action."
He stated that Kim told him to take "appropriate actions" to his liking is a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and is moving toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses about adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year puts all of the undergraduate students there to more sleep, in a bid to fight a macho culture in developing learning through a caffeine-powered ‘owl man’.
One academic found that students at the world’s number one universities often don’t know anything about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine specializing in sleep problems at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
She was inspired to start the course after giving lectures on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day a girl came up to me and said: ‘Why am I just being told now, in my final year?’
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, explains to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improving their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students who were severely sleep deprived throughout the week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there was an overview of the dorm room, where students clicked on coffee cups, curtains, exercise pants, and books to get an explanation of the effects of caffeine and lights, as well as how athletic outcomes were affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep routines.
In another section, participants were given an explanation of how long sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know this won't change students' behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health," Czeisler said.
The culture of being proud of the 'badang' still exists, he said, plus that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you sleep enough, with good quality, should be a ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he says — even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain activate hunger mode, inducing continued hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California resident who studied chemistry and physical biology who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes that all graduate students will be instructed to complete a similar program of study before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students should consider setting a sleep alarm, also a wake alarm, and be aware of the effects of the ‘blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its regulatory path causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals Menga mentally downgraded Gerrard's team
Again, the Rangers felt the sadness of the day away as Dolly Menga's attack delivered Steven Gerrard's team scattered in a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team attempted to record their first win on their way, since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side had just given Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind Premiership Hearts leader Ladbrokes.
Strike seven minutes before the first half is over and the Rangers' out of mind players don't seem to compensate.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, just behind Hibernian’s goal difference.
And there could be further problems in the Rangers stronghold after the Calum Spence line guard had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Instead, Holt left with the same Livi 11 who took a point away from Hearts last week and he will be delighted with the costumes that captivate their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate possession of the ball, but Livingston makes better use of the ball they have.
They should have scored in just two minutes when Scott Pittman's first short pass was thrown by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder drew the big chance too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs's deep free-kick met captain Craig Halkett but his defenseman Alan Lithgow could only stab wide in the back position.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more expectations than beliefs about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been penalized when he and Steven Lawless collided at the quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers only managed to make two throws in the first half but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, hardly ever had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's easily tamed attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be opposite the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their own hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep dead ball tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm picking Menga for the sake of a simple end.
Gerrard acted on the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the switch was barely direct as the winger put the ball on Morelos but the impressive Kelly was quickly off the line to hit.
But Livingston continued to force the away team to play the game exactly that they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
Holt's team was supposed to widen their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood well to chase Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed a penalty again as he clashed with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his back.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger Cutter
And now from our Almanac "Sunday Morning" page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and will still be added... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually made the device known as the Geiger Counter.
Becoming the mainstay of science since then, the Geiger Count also became the mainstay of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring less convincing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Cutter, used to find the location of radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
While wearing these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms being released by radioactivity in the mineral.”
Evans: "Tell me, it must be popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But it was the discovery that kept his name alive.
New cancer vaccine teaches immune system to ‘recognize’ evil cells
New cancer vaccines teach the immune system to 'recognize' evil cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of treatment
Its method involves the process of extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory.
They can then ‘recognize’ proteins that are common in many cancers and then inject them again.
An experimental vaccine showed promising results in patients with a wide range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize the evil cells, her ovarian cancer was gone for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extracting the patient's immune cells, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "recognize" a protein commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "encourages the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as taking a patient’s immune cells and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West Began a Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wearing a MAGA Hat, After his SNL Appearance.
Not running well
Kanye West was ridiculed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, titled Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great hat, he challenged the Democratic party and repeated his support for Trump.
“Often I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a teaser starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's scam footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to make fun of West with the post.
In addition, West complained to spectators that he was having trouble behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
“They’re stalking me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out wearing that hat.'
They're bumping into me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: "You want to see the sink?" saying that he's going to wear a Superman robe, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do. You want the world to go forward?
Try to love."
His comments resulted in mockery at least twice from the audience and the SNL cast looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person telling: "The whole studio is silent."
West was brought in at the last moment as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, the former girlfriend of rapper Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of his song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West has the backing of TPUSA's conservative group chairman Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU HAPPENED THE PEOPLE."
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being himself and it was really really good."
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his “art”) who I believe adheres to and spews ideologies that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
"So are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "a creature officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and certainly the late musical legend Prince, changing his name to a symbol and later artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword swings in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, refuted the stereotypes of macho heroes, saying that roles on such screens make teenage boys often feel that they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed “something was wrong” and questioned how to deal with the problem of poor masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her co-star in Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, said she felt "sufficient" to discuss the issue.
‘I feel personally, quite strong, right now – where is our fault in terms of this masculinity?’ he said.
'What do we teach the men as they grow up, about the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the emergence of poor masculinity with its highly masculine characters.
He continued: 'Which character is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they have to have this particular side to be men?
I think that’s really one of the big questions in this time – how do we change it?
There’s something wrong with the young people.”
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in the prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series would end next summer, saying that he was already "finished with battlefields and horses".
Since November Kit will star in the return of True West from Sam Shepard, a story about the film's producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to quit Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, thereby giving me a future family, and from here my life begins," she said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the land of the Leslie family residence in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% spike in new cases
China has announced a 14% surge in the number of its population living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking a change from before.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people living with HIV in this way has diminished to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has increased to 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been rampant.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Much of the transmission of the disease comes from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that staff had leaked GOP senator data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of her staff members had submitted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators to the MPs' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party asserted that the claims were driven by experts and an "ultra-right wing" website.
"Lies, lies, and many more vile lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that the information released included the home address and phone number of the United States Senator, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses identifying the source of the shipment were linked to Waters's office and disclosed the information of one of Waters' staff members, Hill reported.
"These unfounded allegations are completely false and are an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“My staff members – whose identity, personal information, and safety are threatened as a result of deceptive and misconduct allegations – are in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
These unfounded allegations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This group is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This shows he is not fit to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something that doesn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They can't deviate.
They cannot question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to shift Waters at the half-time election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's great if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Water said his office had warned "proper authorities and law enforcement entities regarding these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the culprits will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions to any and all of my staff members."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Rowan Atkinson's poor spy parody
Currently looking for Brexit significance in every new film with a biased view of the UK already being a tradition and that seems to be true for the re-emergence of Johnny English's action-comedy parody franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcasm be sarcastic about how clearly we are becoming a new export opportunity for this country?
However, the glaring, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has renewed his license to mess things up a second time – his name hints more than anything else that he is a vast comic creation designed for a language-language cinema region other than English.
Surely he is a mad secret agent who, despite his strange conjecture, has little Clouseau character, a chunk of Mr. Bean character and a wanderer who contributed little note to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Indeed, he is indeed based on the international traveller and mysterious man Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving the chaos behind him.
There was one or two sweet moments on this latest JE journey.
I love it when Johnny English approaches the helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor propeller quickly sticks to his helmet.
Atkinson's prize for physical comedy was shown, but his humor felt less energetic and too strange, especially when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible had been confident to include comedy as an ingredient.
His humor felt like it was aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English’s strange misfortunes were not as innovative and focused as Atkinson’s jokes in Bean’s personality.
The warming premise of these years is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web, uncovering the identities of all British agents in the field, to disappoint the on-stage agent - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This was the last chance for an arrogant and hostile prime minister, who had completely destroyed his political popularity: Emma Thompson played a very good role with the quasi-Teresa-May character but not much to process from the script.
His savvy adviser provides information that since every active spy has been weakened, he must bring someone out of retirement.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English himself, now employed as headmaster in some luxurious buildings, but gives a secret lesson on how to conduct an undercover operation: there are some nice jokes here, when English offers a spy academy like the School of Rock.
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with long-suffering friend Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, the suckling role of a top-class woman in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat eliminated.
So Batman and Robin who make a mistake on His Majesty's Secret Agent return to action, meet the mysterious beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is alarmingly falling under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to solve Britain’s computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their silly adventure: disguised as waitresses, they set fire to a French fast-food restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury ship; and English sparks anarchy as he tries to use Virtual Reality headsets to get used to the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are certainly drawn to the final sequence, but with such hospitality and chaos, there are few children’s TV channels containing about it all.
It's a pretty moderate thing.
And like other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that's really suited for his talent?
Workers deny plans for British citizens to work four days a week but are paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labor Union considered a radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week - but was paid five days.
The union reportedly wants corporate owners to forward the savings through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
He would let the employees enjoy a three-day weekend – but still get the same pay.
Some sources said the idea would be "passive" with the party's economic agenda and plans encouraging the country to support workers.
The transition to four days a week has been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A senior trade union source told The Sunday Times: "A review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but four working days a week is an aspiration in line with the party’s approach to rebalance the economy that supports the workers and the party’s industry strategy as a whole.”
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, as the Greens had already pledged four working days a week at the 2017 general election campaign.
However, these aspirations are not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "Four working days a week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to perfect his vision for the socialist revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from ‘anonymous directors’ and ‘catchers’ at utility companies.
This shadow chancellor's plan also means that current shareholders in drinking water companies may not regain all of their shares as the Labour government can make a 'reduction' on the grounds of perceived violations.
He also ensured his plans to put workers on the company’s board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company’s private sector equity to employees, which would pocket annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised questions as to whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to revoke their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find something that could make them change their minds.
Looks like Kennedy is more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I was going to the trial, I said, I’ve spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charge came up, and said, 'You did it?'
He is a firm, determined, firm man."
However, it seemed that Graham’s voice would not be altered.
“My mind has decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it takes a bigger charge to change that,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but all I know is: Brett denied it out loud," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all the people he mentioned in his name were unable to verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has the event done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a highly impressive array of stars, and a memorable mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively battling poverty.
In order to get free tickets for the event (unless you want to pay for VIP tickets), concert visitors must complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been over the past 12 years in achieving its goals?
Is the idea of giving free concerts the right way to get people into action, or is it just another case called “clicktivism” – people feel like they’re making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, prompting it to set other goals.
It said this action has helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had collected 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, at least <0x24>10 billion of which had been channelled or fundraised.
The group estimates that safe funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children grow to their maximum potential," promising to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make this social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told a crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were undertaken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions on their website that asked "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizens responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we are united we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars performing at this year's show in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy as a "blockade" to hamper Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
“If necessary” Washington could seek the Navy’s help to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspects that Russia’s involvement in Syria – in particular, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government – is a pretext to explore a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to be energy brokers, just like they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reported.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has that capability, with our Navy, to ensure open sea lines, and, if necessary, to blockade, to ensure that their energy cannot get into the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke before attendees of the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "voice of energy customers" in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach to the deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
“The economic options in Iran and Russia are more or less, utilizing and replacing fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as one of the “experts in that field” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as representatives of the Trump administration are on a mission to boost their exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 refinery pipeline project, which Trump says makes Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 refinery project, designed to double the capacity of the existing refinery pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denied that Washington’s hard-fought resistance to the project was solely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy cannot be used as a tool to carry out pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This U.S. stance has drawn a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I will face a big problem if a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Watch the Situation" While Candidate for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "watch the situation" while running for president after the midterm elections.
While campaigning at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and improve our degenerate government, including putting women at the top," he told The Hill.
“After November 6, I will look at the situation while running for president.”
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning in the town hall, saying that he was "bringing the region in the wrong direction.
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was outspoken in delivering his criticisms of Trump and Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before conducting a vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday, showed that most of Warren's own constituencies did not want him to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said senators should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent supported the election.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run, with 38 percent in favor of the possibility of running and 48 percent against him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed in connection with the possibility of running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Palin's PTSD Track during Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in Sept.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he will be going through on his return, I can connect with other families who are also experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are going through,” he told a crowd attending the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest like an "elephant in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "they came back slightly differently, they came back louder, they came back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence offences against a woman, coupled with reports of domestic violence and gun possession in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenges to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of plaintiff Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner "and his son who was a violent gang member," had harassed him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum request on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
The state prosecutor in favor of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced large numbers of asylum applicants for the U.S., as countries facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy contrasts with a 2014 Immigrant Council decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores state, federal, and international laws that have been in place for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims should be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances relating to such claims, and such a ban violates the principle," the friend-of-the court brief said.
The prosecutor gave a brief opinion that the policy of refusing immigrant entry harms the U.S. economy, saying that it is likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang cruelty.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home countries because of persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, nationality, or membership issues in certain social groups, or political opinions,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum is not meant to alleviate all the problems -- even though all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue effort in Palu as the victims doubled as they raced against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
“It was very stressful,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her depressed baby boy at a refugee centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is very rare.”
Residents are seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up things that are submerged in water, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, the damage caused by the 7.5-magnitude quake, was chaotic.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered spinal and shoulder fractures, lie outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors due to a strong aftershock.
Tears flowed as he recounted his feelings as the quake shook his fifth-floor hotel room where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
"Not a chance to save myself.
I think I was pinned to the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding his family was in the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, and then I was silent.
I don't know about him and my son.
May they be safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidating' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a US daily calling the reciprocal gains of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement on the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6, an allegation denied by China.
Trump's allegations that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections, marking what U.S. officials have told Reuters, are a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently shackled in an ever-increasing trade war, which has led them to raise tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa who support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor leading Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and businessmen in America.
China, Branstad wrote an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubling the intimidation by running propaganda ads in our own free media."
“In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government harnessed the highly valued tradition of freedom of speech and press freedom in America with a paid ad on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at street newspaper vendor stalls here in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and will not see actual reflections on different opinions that the Chinese people may have regarding China’s troubled economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent media outlets declined an offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warn, Republicans Keep Female Voters Ahead of Part-time Election With Kavanaugh Disaster
As many key Republicans stand and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see counter-attacks, especially from women, at the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions over the matter are very high, and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to move forward on the vote.
It can't be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake's last-minute push to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to defuse anger on voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators chanted "November is near!" as they staged a rally in the Senate hallway as Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee to move forward in Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democracy's enthusiasm and motivation will be out of the list," non-party political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news website.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it could be even higher, particularly among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they dislike the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailed sexual abuse against him by the Supreme Court’s nominee, analysts advised a counter-attack would follow if Republicans kept pushing him forward with confirmation.
“It’s a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chairman, told NBC News.
"It's not just about the election of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how Republicans deal with this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to vote for the Democratic Party, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans are likely to be torn apart as to who to trust after testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, with the choice slightly more in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or may believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they really believe or may believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or really lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that drunk Kavanaugh had assaulted him when he was 17.
Ramirez said the Supreme Court nominee showed her his penis as they attended a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventors plan to start new Internet to face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the Berners-Lee open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, jokingly Berners-Lee said that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination."
“We have to start now,” he said from the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
This storage can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The uniqueness of this online personal data storage is that it really is up to the user who can access what kind of information.
In companies it is known as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of setting up Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to present the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of code-making volunteers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all of their business models will actually be reversed overnight.
"We didn't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the neutrality of network debates.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next web era,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorating the clergy of WW1 Victoria Cross
The only Church cleric in England to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior, is commemorated in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for the attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his granddaughters, Michael Vann, said this was a stone "symbol of intelligence" that would reveal exactly the 100 years of his grandfather's award-winning achievements.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "penetrating a very thick fog under a string of fire from field guns and machine guns."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with "greatest courage" led the front line before rushing using field weapons alone and crippling three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I wouldn’t be able to live but it was a very humble act.”
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honoured to take part in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many will give."
MMA fans stay up all night watching the Bellator 206, but instead they get Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you’ve stayed up all night watching the overcrowded Bellator 206 just to be refused to watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being aired live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, audiences in England were stunned when his coverage turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they stay up until the early hours of the morning specifically for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the turnaround to a children's cartoon as an "annoying joke."
"It is government regulation, that at 6 a.m. the content is not suitable for airing, so it is replaced with a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Yes, the pig."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would improve their scheduling by taking into account audiences in the UK in the future.
“I think if we think about the replay, I think we might be able to finish it,” Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock there on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the time of change, there are a lot of texts going back and forth and all of them are not educational.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government issue.
Trust me, next time it won’t happen again.
We will reduce to five fights alone out of six fights – as we usually do – and we will try to avoid oversight for fans, and we succeeded.
This is an unfavorable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'lowly' over sexuality issues
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with a low self-esteem due to his sexuality problems – but that gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize it until he entered high school, that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about the right of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of the long-running event, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off due to illness.
Performing as the people who were eliminated on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "less than" everyone else growing up with her because "it's not socially acceptable to like men and women."
“To this day, that feeling is less than anything else, and that feeling is different, has become the real thing that gives me the power and strength to succeed.”
She wanted to prove that she was "something," he said, so she wouldn't let everyone down when they found out about her sexuality issues.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known LGBT campaigner and used her performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discriminating against homosexuals.
She said she spoke because she felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley was married to an Oscar winner 20 years older than her last year, and she said the age gap was not a problem.
"When you had so many problems at a very young age" - she attended her first Olympics at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who had the same ups and downs.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley saying his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it's all around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
“You know, there’s something bigger than just winning an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had already got tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't say to him 'you're not going to sit in the front row of dad'," he said.
"I held her hand as she stopped breathing and still hadn't really stopped breathing until she died, I finally admitted that she was unbeatable," she said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All I know is that this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired his first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – which had already fused with him in his preparations for the Olympics and still made him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast broadcast on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson switched roles when he was backed up for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must switch roles to avoid unpleasant achievements.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event to set his 12th record, was suggested by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball and group four game on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, this five-time major winner splits his time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on that range, hoping to fix what has bothered him.
Never being the straightest golf batsman though at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not fit to take a very rigorous course at Le Golf National, which routinely delivers lengthy and harsh penalties for every false shot.
And for his own pitch, it’s not scary enough for Mickelson, in his ninth game on Sunday, to face highly accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American golfer, starting a single 12 game with four points below, starts it with a hot start, then Mickelson’s game will prove to be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say so many other things.
“He really understood his role today, patted my back and embraced me, and said he would be ready for tomorrow’s game,” Furyk said.
"He's so confident.
He is the Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can’t imagine him playing two games.
I imagined the others, but that's how they play and that's the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy other atmospheres, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Ryder Cup game, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup which would never equal the height of his individual record.
Mickelson bagged 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought some things that could not be said to the team.
"He's cute, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," she explained.
“I think the younger players are having fun with him, this week too, which is pretty fun to see.
He gave me a lot of things, more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, learned from experience that someone who led big enough to his last single game in the Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
The Dane made his first debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point lead over the Americans, but had just touched the finish line with their noses by the slimmest margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get a big advantage at Valderrama; we get a big advantage at Brookline, where we lose, and at Valderrama, where we win, but just now," said Bjorn, taking a picture, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone in that team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will enter a really boring game.
Go out and do everything right.
It’s not over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win this trophy, and that's the focus.
I’ve been saying for a long time, I’m focused on the 12 players that are on our side, but we’re also very aware of what’s on the other side – the greatest players in the world.”
Glad to see the players play on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "In this case I'm never going to advance on my own.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will go forward, and this is a different thing that will be done.
It’s great to be out there with a colleague when everything goes well, but if you’re out there playing individually, then your full potential as a golfer will be tested.
That’s the message you have to pass to all the players, getting the best out of yourself for tomorrow’s game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they do as a pair, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the last day of the big game, having been part of a winning team at Brookline before ending in defeat as Europe performs the "Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every one of those words," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together to the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as quickly as you can see in Brookline, as you can see in Medina.
When the momentum goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also organise the list of players and put people in different ways that we feel, you know, we are trying to do the magic of tomorrow.
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the match against Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players at the top.
“I went with this group of people in this order because I felt like I could shut down all the way,” Bjorn said of his sole choice.
Germany's new warship suspended
The newest German Navy escort ship should have begun service in 2014 to replace an old Cold War-era warship, but it will not be there until at least next year due to the wrong system and rising costs, local media reported.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" assignment, the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class escort ship, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-shipping issues have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships already ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come in place of the aging Bremen-class bodyguards.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar eraser, infrared, and acoustic locks.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to use the latest escort ship for two years away from its home port.
However, the constant delay meant this sophisticated warship - which was said to allow Germany to accentuate its power abroad - would be obsolete at the time it began to enter its tenure, Die Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 escort ship was reported last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Few reasons are known behind the ship's return, but German media cited important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless if used for combat missions.
The software flaw was crucial because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on the older Bremen-class warships.
It was also discovered that the ship's weight was excessive which would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future updates.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to the damaged hardware, the cost of production of the entire project - including crew training - was also a problem.
It was said to rise surprisingly to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) - up from its initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The issue that shackles the new bodyguards is becoming very important given the latest warnings due to a shrinkage in the German naval force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy was actually "out of ships with deployment capabilities."
The official said that over time the problem grew, as old ships were no longer in use but no replacement ships were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class escort ships could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats in secret
New research was conducted at a plantation in the Scottish Highlands aimed at uncovering how bats use landscapes in their food hunts.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common pipistrelle and soprano as well as the long-eared brown bats and the Daubenton at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recorder will be placed in the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
A sound expert who analyzes all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and which species performs what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be created to create images with detailed landscape scales about their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes these results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits are derived from habitat management work such as pasture making and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout England has declined sharply in recent centuries.
These bats are threatened by development and development work affecting nests and habitat loss.
Wind and lighting turbines also pose risks, such as sticky paper hung to trap bats as well as building materials chemical treatments, as well as attacks from pet cats.
The bats are not blind.
However, due to his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes in terms of catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo location techniques to find insects precisely and barriers in their flight paths.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, cares deeply about bats.
It has ten trained experts, who routinely conduct surveys, nest checks, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organization has also established the first and only nature reserve in Scotland on Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Plantation manager David Thompson said the plantation was a suitable area for bats.
“Here in Threave, we have a good area for bats,” he said.
“We have ancient buildings, lots of old trees, and all good habitats.
However, there's still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive."
He emphasized the importance of checking bats before performing maintenance inside the property, as it was unaware there was a possibility that the destruction of one maternity nest could kill up to 400 female and young bats, which would probably annihilate the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killing, harassing, or disturbing, or destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bats Conservation Trust, has encouraged the general public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species that we don't yet know how their populations will fare."
Ronaldo who rejected rape claims is preparing lawyer to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claims against him "fake news," and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was later alleged to have paid it by giving <0x24>375,000 to keep his mouth shut regarding the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no.
All they're saying today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They wanted to be famous by mentioning my name, but it was part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they refer to as "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz's lawyers said it would seek compensation as "a moral compensation in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which may have been one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly had raped her, according to a report filed in the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good guy" who disappointed only "one percent."
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but it was on the basis of mutual desire.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and had made a visa for her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to settle the matter out of court because she felt "feared of retaliation" and feared "would be publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to cancel the peace settlement because she has been constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain ‘will regret forever’ over loss of automakers
Britain “will regret forever” if it loses its status as a world leader as a carmaker after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added "about" Toyota, the UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of a border delay if there is no deal would be detrimental to Brexit in terms of job costs.
The plant in Burnaston - which makes Auris and Toyota's Avensis production - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported across the European Union.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will see a stop in production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other British automakers have expressed their concerns about an exit from the European Union without an agreement on how cross-border trade will run, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main issue related to what the automakers say is the supply chain risk if there is no deal with Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on the “timely” production principle, with parts coming in every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars made on-demand.
If the UK exits the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be a disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventories for more than a day at its factory in Derbyshire, said a representative of the company, and thus production would be halted.
Clark said Chequers Theresa May's plans for future relations with the European Union were "properly calibrated to avoid border checks."
“We have to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I’m saying not only to enjoy success at the moment, but for us to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The evidence is not only from Toyota but other manufacturers as well, that we really need to be able to continue what is already a very good supply chain.”
Toyota cannot say how long its production will be discontinued, but that is clear in the long run, warning that additional costs will reduce the factory's competitiveness and will ultimately be detrimental in terms of job costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union manager of Unite’s factory, said his members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, once this job is free, it will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a proper and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House says
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with deputy attorney-general Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed back another week” as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the relationship between Trump's aides and Russia, as well as potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s freedom, has sparked gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using a telegram to record conversations with Trump and possibly depose the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was again postponed to avoid clashes with Senate judiciary committee hearings where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both will testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting hasn't been set, maybe in this week, I can see that it's good to take it back to another week in light of the other things that happened in the Supreme Court.
But let’s see and I always want to get the latest news out to the press.”
Some reporters will object to the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the sparseness of meetings was not out of dislike for TV reporters "who were trying to attract attention," though, he said: "I don't agree with the fact that they are trying to attract attention."
Then he proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
“The president is doing more direct question and answer sessions than the previous president,” he added without mentioning evidence: “We’ve seen those numbers.”
The meeting will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, it's much better than talking to me.
“We try to do it more often and you’ve seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump routinely asks questions as he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting high-ranking officials.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably point out why, performing free and sometimes bizarre appearances before reporters gather.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about concerns over Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and hope they will still work here after the Brexit issue.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent the letter in less than six months until Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to meeting the cost of filing a fixed status for EU citizens working in the transferred public service.
In his letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on this withdrawal are still ongoing, approaching the decision expected this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for a possible scenario of no deal.
I know this must be very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I now want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and others, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health care work, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before the half-time ended.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell unconscious there," Reed said.
The coach and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further evaluation.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was already out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/level of injury suffered" and the State of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this red-shirted second-grade student, was in his first season with the State of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He earned a total of five tackles on Saturday before coming out of the game, which made his total during the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher sealing fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher sealing fee when they buy property in the UK, along with additional money to be used to help the homeless according to the new Tory plan.
This move will withstand the pace of Corbyn's movement's success in attracting young voters
This increase in sealing costs will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury estimates it will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK – along with additional money to be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to withstand the success rate of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts in attracting young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high incomes.
The increase in sealing costs will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, along with additional money that drives the Government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
Additional costs – which are additional costs on current sealing costs, including higher levels introduced two years ago on second home purchases and home purchases for rent – could reach three percent.
The Treasury Department expects this move to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London were purchased by non-British residents, which led to price hikes and made it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to set foot on the housing ladder.
Many of the rich areas of the country – usually in the capital – have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a week after Boris Johnson called for a cut in sealing costs to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to ignore quotas for affordable homes in order to improve the "homeownership disgrace" in the UK.
Corbyn has announced a series of exciting housing reform proposals, including oversight of rents and ending "no guilt" evictions.
He also wanted to give more power to the council to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I promised I would dedicate the post of prime minister to recovering the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our dilapidated housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not appropriate for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as overseas-based companies, to buy a home as easy as the UK’s already hard-working residents.
For many people the dream of owning a home becomes something very distant, and the indecent treatment of the homeless remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead the Scottish team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "main ambition" was to become the manager of Scotland at several stages.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One, three points away from the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to defend my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's him," Ross told Sportssound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and often watched the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it was always something that attracted me to come back.
However, the opportunity will come, if I succeed in the management of the team."
Sunderland's manager before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he did not feel afraid to follow in the footsteps of big names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, the success of the moment will be measured by ‘can I return this club to the Premier League?’
Due to the structure and facilities at this club, there is no doubt to be in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to be there, but I would probably only see myself as a successful person here, if I could bring this club back there.
Ross's career in team management was only three years, after some time as assistant boss at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coaching staff at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to third, and turned St Mirren from the brink of relegation into a Championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says he is now more comfortable than he has ever been during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"This may be a crossroads I have to go through," he recalled as he took over Alloa.
"I really believe management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I’m fine, make a living in a reasonable way, and enjoy some natural things.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still experience it in terms of job pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I always wanted to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt in my adult life."

The survey found that the best time to drink beer was at 5:30 on Saturday.
The summer heatwave has boosted UK pubs' earnings struggling to survive, but puts more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures showed pubs and bar groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but revenue at restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business consultant, who compiled the figures, said: “The blazing sunshine and England’s participation in the World Cup longer than expected mean, July will follow the same pattern as June before, where pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that were hit hard.
A 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade in June will worsen in July.
The sales of pubs and bars selling drinks are by far the strongest compared to the ones happening at downstairs restaurants.
Pubs selling food are also suffering from the heat of the sun, although not as bad as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just go out for a drink.
Sales across managed pubs and bars selling beverages rose 6.6 percent for the month, with those selling food down three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreational and hospitality analyst said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since April.
The weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales of the outdoors market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales would be extremely painful above the ongoing cost pressure.

One in five children have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
One in five children - some of whom are still 11 - have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
Survey of 20,000 high school students reveals development of "false Insta" page
This news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "primary" account to show to parents
One in five children — some of whom are still 11 — set up social media accounts they keep secret from adults.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid development of "false Insta" accounts - a reference to a photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they operated a "primary" account that had been cleared to show parents, while also having a personal account.
A mother who discovers the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, finds a teenager asking others to "rape me."
Research conducted by the UK Digital Awareness and Conference of Male Principals" as well as Female Principals" (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep personal accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's annoying so many teenage children are trying to create online spaces that their parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of stewards.
Doyle is Scotland's most honoured track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his international experience over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England and the world athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by taking him on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for the athletes and I look forward to really contributing and helping lead the sport in Scotland."
The American athletic, who won the number 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC expert, is now unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “Today I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I can't walk.
Doctors said it was only time to determine if I could recover and to what extent.
It’s a very tiring job to fully recover, re-learn how to walk, and today do the dexterity exercises!
Thank you for such encouraging messages!”
Breast pump ads that compare mothers to cows have split opinions in the online world
Breast pump companies have split opinions in the online world with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to milked cows.
To mark the launch of a product said to be “the world’s first silent wearable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a humorous music video to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to express a mother.
Four mothers danced in a barn filled with cow straw following a song that included lyrics like this: "Yeah, I'm flushing myself, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice it this isn't wing, this is my breast."
Continuing with the refrain: " Pump out, pump out, I feed them dear, pump out, pump out, I milk my lady."
However, the ads that have been published on the company’s Facebook page, have caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it makes a “scary” in the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless the baby is stolen from them within days of giving birth.”

Another comment: “Trauma is understandable for both mother and baby.
But yes why not use it to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have to take care of their baby?”
Another added: "An ad that loses meaning."
Another person defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song “funny.”
“I think this is a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still breastfeeding.
Squeezing makes me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad was a little crazy but I accepted it as it was.
It's a genius product," one person wrote.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad aimed at mothers who extort (often at their workplace or toilet) and who feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with a hidden pump tucked inside their bra.
The basis of this campaign concept comes from the insights of many women who extort breast milk who say they feel kayak like cows.
However, Elvie Pump is completely silent, without cables or tubes and fits inside a breastfeeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while squeezing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Elvie pumps are a pioneering product worth launching with convincing and provocative.
By equating the picture between expressing women and dairy cows we want to pump breast milk and all its challenges, and show it by entertaining and fun ways with the full freedom that the new pump presents.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children move quietly to tents on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children is on the rise despite monthly border crossings remaining unchanged, partly as a result of harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that complicate parenting of sponsored children.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and fear to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to save children.
Risks increased in June, when the federal government announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to hand over fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in Immigration and Customs, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor displaced minors.
The agency then ensured that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of sponsorship associations are in the country illegally, and most of them are evil foreigners.
That’s why we continue to hunt those people,” Mr. Albence said.
Aiming to process children faster, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, not after 60 days, which had become the standard before, shelter workers said.
Most of them appear through video conference calls, not directly, to appeal their legal status cases to immigration judges.
Those deemed unfit for help will be immediately deported.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or attempts to escape, said shelter workers and system reports received in recent months.
Lawyers say the concern is mounting at a larger facility such as Tornillo, whose signs are on a struggling child tend to be ignored, due to its size.
They said moving children to the campsite without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or saying goodbye to friends could exacerbate the trauma that has been fought so much.
Syria calls on "occupying forces" from the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s war now entering its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally occupying Syrian soil, citing fighting terrorism, and "will be handled appropriately."
“They should withdraw as soon as possible and without filing any conditions,” he told the assembly.
Moualem asserted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than millions fleeing their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to “fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory” from terror groups and “the presence of illegal foreign soldiers.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and influencing Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in war-torn territory.
Regarding the refugees' problems, Moualem insisted they should return soon, and blamed "some western countries" for "spreading tremendous fears" that pushed the refugees further away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a complete humanitarian problem.”
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement was agreed between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the rebel stronghold of the latter Idlib has resulted in an opportunity to resume political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive attack from Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where there are three million people left.
But Moualem insisted that the agreement had "a clear period of time" and raised hopes that military action would target mujahideen including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be crushed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to create a post-war Act for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, asserting that the work of the panel should be restricted "to review the articles of the current Act," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Period
According to the logic, Trump will win another general election in 2020 unless, as many liberal audiences hope, prosecutions and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
No one doubts, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
So far, there has been no sign of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN’s primetime watch ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the cable TV ratings with 3.5 million viewers on the night of the headlines.
"It's a spirit that attracts people because it's something that's not yet understood," said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol's devastating attack.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He recalled taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he would give Trump his right to vote.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh,'" Miss Scovell told me.
There's a lot of fun in a mess.
Certainly, unlike any other TV show, the storyline that emerges from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and restore the global economy.
Turning away from it, a luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
However, instead of just being a knowledgeable citizen at six o’clock you find yourself witnessing a panel of experts debating the use of Bob Woodward’s “background” source for his book “Fear,” wearing Paul Manafort’s <0x24>15,000-skinned ostrich bomber jacket ("thick dress with arrogance," The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels’s gruesome description of Trump’ anatomy.
This time, I will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
“Part of his policy makes it just like a reality show that entertains you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, Wheelhouse Entertainment’s chief executive and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the performer’s daily performance scene and storyline of Trump (choosing hostile to the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

He was unable to free himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh being prepared to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and subsequently the Supreme Court according to his balance.
“I remember when we had all the crazy shows that day and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.

A lot of money from outside floods the toughest part-time election competition in the White House
It is natural that Pennsylvania 17 gained a flood of money, thanks to the rearrangement of congressional districts that put two incumbents in the same seat race.
The recently reorganized Pittsburgh district filed for Rep. Democrat Conor Lamb - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb advanced against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represented the old district of Pennsylvania 12, which overlapped with the new district of Pennsylvania 17.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts unconstitutionally sided with the Republican party.
Competition in the new district of Pennsylvania 17 has resulted in massive campaign funding between the financial side of the major party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a slim victory in the March general-monitored special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been occupied by Republican officials for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians are pushing the Democratic Party a little higher.
U.S. Considers Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Resigns
The diplomats confirmed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until partners ousted the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which had received about <0x24>140 million in aid from America in 2017, including for narcotics control, development support and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a cut in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt the Central American country and a rise in unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting took place, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on the same meeting last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, top government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to resume, in order to effectively end the consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to deliver a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the government's imports at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys secretly returned again to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing new harsh reprimands or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokeswoman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate presented by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of the unclear circumstances.
Their statements were reinforced by outside analysts close to the government and also spoke about this unclear situation.
Study Stories
Another shocking story is Robert Mueller’s special adviser’s report on possible judicial hurdles Mr Trump, which currently has very important evidence in the public record.
Mr Mueller’s report also discussed his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable from him, just as he prepares to leave again in front of voters, and may eventually become a jury of his partners.
There’s still a lot to do, and I don’t mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump’s administration is inevitable – or its equality in Europe.
There are choices we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler, if only the West were against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed an opportunity in avoiding the years of massacres that followed.
The beginnings of history centered along such points of deviation, and the accelerated or postponed march of democracy was inevitable.
Americans are facing some of these changes.
What should we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since the paper reported that, last year, he suggested discreetly recording the president and arguing that he was unfit for the presidency.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times account is not true.
“How do we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested F.B.I. investigation is incomplete or fair – or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite strong allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to vote in part-time for Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass the test, democracy will get worse over time.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once lived in my embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with swastika.
By leaving that legacy to me, how can I lose hope about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans feels optimistic ahead of game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, arming a win over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury left midfielder Graham Dornans unable to perform in the first season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can take advantage of the result as a stepping stone towards a bigger asa.
"This point is very good for us because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old.
"In this game we are sure we can get something and go with a point.
In the end, we might be able to do it but, in our opinion, a draw might be a fair result.
In the first half, they might have done better but in the second half, we got up and became a better team.
On Thursday, this night will be another great day in Europe.
We hope to get the three points even though it will be a difficult game because they have had a good result in their last game, but, with the support of the supporters behind us, I am sure we can go ahead and get a positive result.
"Last year we had a difficult time, because of my injury and the change in the club itself, but now there are very good expectations at the club.
The squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. It's a good training.
Hopefully now we can thrive, put the past behind us and achieve success.”

Although it turned out that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, it was just that not many people had discussions with their family members about it.
Approximately half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their partners.
Only 10 percent of them said they discussed this with their children.
“They want family members to provide care, but there is no step whatsoever to start the discussion,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
This is where it's time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your own family for care if you don’t tell them what you want in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family, where and how you get treatment, as the one you choose will be very important in determining the cost.
Involve your financial adviser: Your advisor can certainly provide you with his or her help in showing you how to pay the fees.
The financing you choose for long-term care includes a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or insuring yourself with your wealth – as long as you have the money.
Show your legal documents: Face the legal debates that stand in the way.
Assign immediate power to your health care, that is, someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are carried out by professionals when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, a power of attorney in terms of your finances should also be considered.
Someone who is trusted to take care of all your financial decisions should you choose, in addition to ensuring payment of your bills in case you can’t afford it.
Always remember with every small detail: Just imagine when your elderly parents are in an emergency and on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer any questions about medicine or allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to answer.
"It's not just finance that plays an important role, it's who the doctors are dealing with?" Martin asks.

With whom will the dog be cared for?

A man was shot by an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with an air rifle on his way home from a night party.
The victim was in her 40s in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots hit her chest, stomach, and hands.
The shooting was described by officers as occurring around 2:30 BST, and was said to be a "random act."
The victim did not see who attacked him.
The injuries were not life-threatening and a number of witnesses have been filed by police.
Earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, killing at least 384 people, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The interruption of communications made it difficult for officers who channeled aid to get information from Donggala County, an area north of the city of Palu that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, after the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the narrow end of the bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a district over 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative area under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic point in South Sulawesi province is to find fish and grow crops, especially on the Donggala coast.
However, the existence of nickel mining plays an important role in the province, although it is mostly centered in Morowali, across the coast of Sulawesi.
Recorded in the last 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in the tsunami and hundreds of homes in Donggala were destroyed.
In 1996, nine people died in the tsunami in western Donggala.
Seismicly, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and therefore earthquakes will occur regularly.
The number of major earthquakes and tsunamis that have struck in recent years is as follows:
2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, precisely on the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, to the point that it claimed 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of those deaths were in Aceh.
2005: Late in March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes have hit the west coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami on the south coast and killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
The death toll amounted to more than 1,100.
2010: One of the islands on the island of Mentawai, off Sumatra, was also hit by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that instantly devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
Year 2016: Pidie Jaya County, Aceh, also experienced shallow earthquakes and resulting in devastation, as well as panic from people remembered for the devastation caused by the devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
Although this time there was no potential tsunami, more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, dubbed a tourist island, also suffered a major quake that killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily slammed thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, a former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on the pretext of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, blocking reports of domestic violence and countering arrest attempts, as the Alaska State Police reported on Saturday.
According to police reports, when an acquaintance of a woman tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she seized the phone from the woman.
Palin was handed over at the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Prisoner, with a <0x24>500 unsecured fine, as reported by KTUU.
As reported by the news network, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring herself "innocent, as sure as she can" when asked about her defense.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could result in a one-year prison sentence and a <0x24>250,000 fine.
In addition, he was also charged with a Class B criminal charge, with a one-day jail sentence and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
For Palin, the criminal prosecution is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her own mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to make a report on the alleged assault.
The case is currently filed with the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was prosecuted for domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence crimes, and possession of a drunken firearm, which was also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of slapping him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group for linking her son's violent actions to PTSD as a result of his work in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
On Friday, Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi was hit by a violent earthquake, leaving at least 384 dead.
A 7.5-magnitude quake that could potentially trigger a tsunami has devastated thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to continue to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake struck central Sulawesi, located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing how devastating the moment of the disaster circulated widely through social media.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspects of terror attacks in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack in New York City, where eight people have died — a rare and unprecedented sentence in federal crime-related states since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly carried out the attack by crashing a truck he rented from Home Depot into pedestrians and cyclists on a bike lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors had to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injuries, based on a statement of will to sentence the death penalty, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Based on court documents, both charges allow for the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury ensnared Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in alleged extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as allegations of violence and attempted vandalism.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "substantial planning and early maturation," as a portrayal of Saipov's crimes committed with "cruel, cruel, and savage."
Expressed in a statement of will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has resulted in injuries, harm, and losses to the family as well as friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnocco."
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since New York's Southern District last sentenced to death.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, the defendant of the murder of two drug suppliers, was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The execution of the last time in New York federal court in 1953, was imposed on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple found guilty in a espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, of Uzbek origin, showed no remorse as the days and months following the attack went by.
When asked by investigators, he said he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov also revealed to authorities that the attack was inspired by ISIS videos viewed from his phone, as was the contents of the indictment.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges laid against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, expressed "clearly disappointed" at the prosecution's decision.
“In our opinion, the decision to execute rather than accepting a guilty plea for life imprisonment without guarantee of release will only prolong the trauma of those involved in the incident,” Patton said.
Previously, Saipov's defense team had pleaded with prosecutors not to impose the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit negotiations, Tory MP says
Nigel Farage called for "moving the troops of the people" today in protests at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics - as one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested taking part in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bone told a street rally in Birmingham that Britain “should have come out” today if Farage had served as Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenges facing May in the reconciliation of her divided position have been underscored by supporters of Remain Tories who joined a separate protest slamming Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan to stay on track despite Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union.
The allies stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite a bad backlash - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between his proposal package and "chaos".
Bone told the crowd Leave Means Leave at Solihull that he wanted to 'get rid of the Chequers.
The proposal, that Farage should appoint colleagues to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
“If the manager stays with him, we’ll be out now,” he said.
Wellingborough MPs added: "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
He said, while pointing out his opposition to the European Union: “We are not fighting in a world war to be submissive.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the proposal that public opinion has the potential to cause change since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the thinking of the British people has changed and wants fixed conditions, is completely untrue."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the mass action, told reporters: “Simple, I want to say: Prime Minister, listen to your people.
“Chequers are unpopular among the general public, while the Opposition will not vote for them, because they are unpopular with our party and our activists who took to the streets and got us elected in the first place.
Our plea, get rid of the Chequers and start listening to us.'
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Minister maintains their jobs when their promises are fulfilled."
Farage said that political demonstrations must be organised in order to "feel hot" if they want to deny the 2016 referendum decision.
“At the moment the most valuable thing is the trust among us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, affirming to them that ‘we will not allow you to do that’.”
He added in a message to an enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to make our political class, who are preparing to deny Brexit, feel the heat as well.
“We are moving the army of the people of this country that will win us in Brexit and will never give up until the United Kingdom becomes an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, a mob of Remainers moved through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A line of activists appeared to fly the Tories Against Brexit banner after sparking its lineup this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservative group over the security issue of their party’s application when the conference opened.
“These are the people who told us that they could master the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the sake of the anti-friction frontier, in the framework of the boundaryless free trade in Ireland,” he said.
“It was a funny show.
“There’s no good Brexit at all,” he said.
Warren plans to make a "serious move" in the presidential nomination
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "shuffle the presidential nomination" after the November election moment.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic party declared its future in the city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has often criticized President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, Trump's 2016 vice-chairman of the campaign in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was already marked as an opponent of Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s meeting in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, held in a town hall format since Trump took office.
One participant asked him the question, if there were any plans to run for president.
Warren said it was the right time “for women to enter the Washington circle to restore our broken government, and that includes women’s time to top.”
Shooting the Sims, the LSU player.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced the arrest of the suspect in the shooting that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. in an ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, in which a man was identified asking for help as seen in the footage.
Friday morning, Sims, 20, was shot and found dead near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde wanted to protect his friend and Simpson opened fire on him.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, holding a firearm, and shooting it at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without meaningful resistance and put in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6-inch junior player, growing in Baton Rouge, that’s the Sims figure, has played in 32 games with 10 prefixes last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 bounce balls in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team admits victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear at a time when Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in a qualifying event on Saturday that would bring orders Mercedes have a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton as he maintained his position in the first two turns and pulled Vettel to attack his team-mates.
Vettel became the first to drive into the pit and allowed Hamilton to move in density at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued on after several chases that showed the Ferrari driver's reluctance to leave the inside empty at the risk of surviving after a double to hold on in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead for most of the races as he held back a tyre turn to target a quick finish and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth place.
He eventually got into the pits in the 44th lap but was unable to improve his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen finally took fourth.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man who let me.
The team has done an incredible job of having one and two,” Hamilton said.
That's very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday through her insistence that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford on allegations of sexual assault against future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on what was going on in the senate that showed people were “evil and perverted and dishonest.”
"Something can happen and wonderful things that have been happening over the past few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry and evil and perverted and dishonest people," he said.
"When you see the leaks and the leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the documents -- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, wait a minute.
What we're leaking...No, we're not leaking it," he added, as a senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak had not come from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's allegations, I'm not leaking the story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as secret as he requested."
But his rejection was apparently disapproved by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: “I’m going to tell you, it’s really very bad body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the nominee for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse of three women, the president was impressed to suggest Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see crime, perversion, they don’t care who they hurt, they have to walk for power and oversight,” the mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made amends on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the home game 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants got a two-goal lead first after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the hosts balanced before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat this season experienced by Adam Keefe's men, who managed to catch up and eventually outscored to be able to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with three Giants wins in the previous game.
The opener from Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a pass given by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving the pass when Beauvillier managed to double the lead four minutes later.
In a solid opening period, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the pass-pad for a balance Cownie made at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first break when kicking his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The hosts reunited and Bouchard once again balanced their position with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee an edge for the first time at the end of the second period and he ensured victory with his team in the middle of the fifth during the final period.
The Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats in their five games, are at home to face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic driver dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on board survived the quake
An air traffic guide in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after his death while ensuring the plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others disappeared after a major earthquake hit the Sulawesi islands on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continued to shake the region and many were trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades fleeing for their safety, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan the Great refused to leave his post at a violently shaken guide tower at Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He chose to stay to ensure Air Batik Flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, could safely take off.
He then jumped off the traffic guide tower as he felt the tower starting to collapse.
He died afterwards in the hospital.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Aviation Navigation Service, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision could save hundreds of lives, reports ABC Australia.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter managed to reach Palu.
"We are all saddened to hear this," he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the National Disaster Management Agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was difficult.
"The casualties are believed to continue to rise as many of the victims' bodies are still overgrown in the rubble and many others cannot be achieved," said national disaster management agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have caused the hammer to collapse which led to a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carried aid and various supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets everywhere are looted"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s been a tragedy, but it might get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says one person is missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operated a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia said one person had disappeared, after it had previously been delivered to 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it was unable to identify a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said the remaining six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the complete sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the US navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon around the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt the plane went beyond the runway.
Passenger American citizen Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
“That’s really good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to navigate waist-high water through the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He conveyed the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working close to the repaired docks also helped rescue use rubber boats to transport people ashore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Aviation Security Network indicates 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes over the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analysts reveal the timeline of the night woman who was burned alive
The prosecution took place on Saturday in a re-examination of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made an outline for the jury on how he used cell phone recordings to collect movements made by 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the eve of his death.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, inversely to the previous defendant's statement, Clarion Ledger said.
When data showed the defendant's mobile phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police finally asking for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford attended the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in the city on the day of the incident.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in a Sanford truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "mental, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency conveyed by Tellis was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the death of the victim.
Mobile phone footage indicates they knew each other within a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis sometimes deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped the victim out of his life," Hale said.
The defence is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would lead to a jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of hip hop trio want to challenge the genre’s negative outlook by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, which originated in Bristol, claims the hip hop movement is away from the origins of political messages and crashes into social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make the hip hop spirit popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through several artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
NY caregivers sue couple for attacking after issuing "racist" message
A New York caregiver sued one partner for discriminatoryly attacking after receiving an indirect message from a complaining mother and declaring that she was "another black man."
The couple rejected that they were considered racists, and considered it more like "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed concern when she realized that her new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOTHER BLACK PEOPLE,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she instead sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, stating that they were evicting a nanny, a mixed African-American, for doing a bad job and expecting more Filipinos, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home using Uber.
Maurice is currently demanding that the couple be compensated for the dismissal, and is seeking compensation of about <0x24>350 a day for a period of six months, in exchange for the caregiver's work he initially had to do, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that," he told the Post on Sunday, then added "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple countered claims they were racist, stating the workers Maurice fired were a reason to do, fearing they could not trust him after offending him.
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
“But can you allow your children to be cared for by someone you have abused, even if it’s just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As wrapped in a "squeeze," his wife Plasco said just two months ago gave birth to her baby and was in a "very difficult situation."
“You’re going after someone who’s in such a situation?
That's not a good thing to do," investment bankers added.
While the legal case is still in progress, the public opinion court has quickly criticized the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
Paddington publisher fears readers won't get in touch with talking bears, new newspaper revealed
His daughter Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born not far after her book had been received, is described in the letter. "It's very difficult to just talk without knowing the position she was in, reading it first before it was published.
It's funny to know as much as we know about Paddington's great success."
Saying his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through a children’s book writing with a bear toy, was very optimistic about his rejected work, he added the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was “bitterly sweet” after his father’s death last year.
To Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member of our family,” he added his father was quite proud of the end of his success.
"He's a pretty quiet person, and he's not a arrogant person," he said.
“But because Paddington means so much to him, it’s like you have a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of them even though it’s not all your effort.
I think he sees Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was the result of his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.”
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her over the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors failed to save her.
“Nad made a call calmly to convey it was so bad that he was most likely not going to survive,” Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die in the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors have given to keep her heart beating continue to slowly run out and leave her system.
He had died sometime during the handling process and everything felt deadly.
I can just sit there and wait, understanding all this has been revealed.
I couldn’t moan, or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold on to it all.”
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently grieving the loss of her daughter, boards the plane along with the other passengers – unaware of what she has gone through.
“No one knows,” he said.
“My head was slackened and my tears continued to drip all the time.
It was hard to explain, but on that flight I felt a deep sympathy for Nad.
He needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her."
grieving women post cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who lost a loved one try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspirational messages and numbers that can be contacted for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when she began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son is a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knows him by his smile.
They always say that his smile brightens the mood.”
But, he stopped working before he died, like he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that there will be lasting effects."
Mrs. Davis made the cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can come up to and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit and keep quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he was feeling sad or depressed or anything," she said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He’s in his lowest point on Christmas Day – when the kids open their gifts he doesn’t look into their eyes or anything.”
He said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to go through it: "It's a gulf in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future was in uncertainty as the FBI began its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he asked for - a time-limited investigation, limited in scope - we might be able to bring a bit of unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "broken" amid a deadlock of the council ruling.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
All of this is due to time.
Legislative elections are five weeks away, on November 6 – if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, they will become very weak in their chances of getting the person they want elected to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush had contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes among the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors ‘falls’ under Kim
The number of people who defected from North Korea to South Korea has declined dramatically since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs raised by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
Most defectors from the North were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return home.
The relationship between the North and the South – which is technically still in war – has greatly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on pending denuclearization negotiations.
This comes after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of development since.
“Without confidence in the United States, there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, there is no way we would have dropped our weapons unilaterally,” Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical," saying he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said he was not temperamentally fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't avoid the thought that if a woman performs like that, they will say 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost screaming and having difficulty talking when discussing his family and his years during high school.
He also bluntly condemned Democrats in the committee, saying the charges against him were "unreasonable and coordinated character killings" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that she could not serve in the Supreme Court because she was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats."
Pelosi objected if she would try to prosecute if she was approved, and if Democrats gained more votes in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this way -- if he didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he wouldn't be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential ruling against the Health Services Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as a conservative justice fanatic.
In the appointment hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not time for someone hysterical and biased to go up to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that great,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to handle it.
It was ethical insults, anger for months and years, and she couldn't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry: Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s weird, what do you think?”
She continued, “I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she was also crying when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then he continued.
And I think it's brilliant."
Tears were ejected as a way out of anger partly because he was essentially misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of the early work, in a male-dominated office, one day when I cried with inexpressible rage, was my neck held by an older woman – a cold manager that I was always a little afraid of – who dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they're successful."
Patricia Schroeder, who is a congressman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, understood that there was no reason for her not to run for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Somebody called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Because it was too late in the campaign, he was left behind in fundraising, and so he swore he would not contest the election unless he managed to raise 2 million dollars.
It was a fight that ended in defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to men only gave him <0x24>250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
As he announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overpowered by emotions — gratitude to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger toward sexism — making it difficult to speak.
"You'd probably think I was too nervous," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
"You would think that Kleenex is my sponsorship company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
"He's crying?"
How U.S.-China trade rivalry might be good for Beijing
The opening shot of a trade rivalry between the US and China is deafening, and as the fight is far from over, the tide between the two countries may be profitable for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese export goods including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
A very significant increase was imposed starting this week with new tariffs affecting <0x24>200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively imposing a tax on half of all goods coming into the U.S. through China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, recently imposing tariffs to five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pleaded to equalize the U.S. one-by-one, and the world's second-largest economy will not change anytime soon.
Telling Washington to step down means following the will, but publicly yielding to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards appropriately, U.S. trade competition pressure could positively support China in the long run by reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that Washington or Beijing’s quick political decisions can make the conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries are actually more dangerous than what observers have known before,” said Abigail Grace, a Asia-focused research fellow at the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria said it was ready for a voluntary refugee return and offered help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country were improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to advances in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government went on to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore them to what they were.
All conditions are present because of the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and comprehensive economic decisions that make their daily lives and livelihoods a target.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced from the country since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not receive any conditional aid or assistance from countries that supported the insurgency.
Europe confirms Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup defeating the U.S. Team by a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its trophy as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who attempted most of the tournament, hit his tee punch into the water at the par 3 hole 16, admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined throughout his round, becoming 1 in 4 players to ever get 5-0-0 since the format prevailing in the tournament began in 1979.
American athlete Jordan Spieth was defeated 5<0x26>4 by the lowest-placed player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who might have played in his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia became European with an overall win with 25.5 career points at the tournament.
“I don’t usually cry but I can’t hold it today.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you very much to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I can help," Garcia said emotionally after the European win.
He gave his responsibilities to compatriot John Ram who beat legendary US golfer Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in a single game on Sunday.
“The amazing pride I felt, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
Strange statistics by one of the best players of all time, have won 14 major titles just under Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to get a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these people, they fight.
There was a time this morning when we were making it difficult for Europe.
We're fighting.
Respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to rearrange, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're going to step forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to pay your respects.
We lost the top.”
