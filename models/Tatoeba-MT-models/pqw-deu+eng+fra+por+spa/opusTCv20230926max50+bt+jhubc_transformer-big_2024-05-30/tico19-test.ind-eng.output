The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is increasing rapidly in the European Union/Economic Region of Europe and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in EU countries/Economic Regions of Europe and the United Kingdom confirming that, although the stages vary depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very fast in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, the country, hospitals and intensive care units should improve its readiness for a surge in COVID-19 patients that will require health care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, clusters of cases of pneumonia with an unidentified etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent of the disease is a new coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of COVID-19 sufferers have a mild illness, an infection of the airway with or without pneumonia, with most of these sufferers recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to more severe illnesses requiring hospital care, while 6% of cases develop critical illnesses requiring intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we examined the cumulative incidence trends of COVID-19 in EU countries/European Economic Areas (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to incidents in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during January 31–March 15, 2020.
Covid-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 experienced a further geographical spread and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are currently following the dynamics of the pandemic in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with confirmed COVID-19 cases based on WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected across 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with those dates including, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases notified by each country around the world is updated daily at 8.00. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the country’s Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK, as well as compare them to trends in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculate the 14-day cumulative incidence, so take into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, in the period January 1–March 15, 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases notified by each country until 15 March 2020 at 8:00 p.m. compared to the Italian case during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
Covid-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
A 14-day cumulative incidence trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows a trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21, then increased sharply around February 28, 2020 (Additional Materials).
The trend is mainly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK are showing a similar trend of increasing cumulative COVID-19 incidence (additional).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period January 31–March 15, 2020.
The data highlighted that, as of March 15 at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases notified is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and UK.
The observed trend on the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 signals that the pandemic is increasing at a comparable pace in all countries.
This is despite the different stages experienced by countries, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and differences in protocols to choose which patients should be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected Italian region explained the situation of about 10% of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, the admission data of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA level is only available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data is not shown).
However, the data must be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and death rates.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 show huge variations in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
Modeling scenarios related to saturation of healthcare capacity, with estimates of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases for each EU/EEA and UK country relating to risk >90% exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since so far cases have been classified in certain regions of the EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve specific regional service coverage populations, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided at the Naming Area Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very fast in the EU/EEA and UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, particularly intensive care, such as those in affected areas in Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive approach is crucial to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with the transition from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as a rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, receive and adapt to appropriate responses if they were not implemented previously.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
A short window of opportunity is available as the country has the possibility to further increase its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, other EU/EEA state health care systems are likely to face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more contagious and affects the elderly than younger people, and more in men than in women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications about this emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive review of a fast-growing research subject.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope this review helps to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all the Chinese who were ordered to stay home during the holidays and a few weeks thereafter due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease it causes is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being repatriated and 3,000 deaths.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy of the public” and potentially more damaging than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020 that established isolated viral sequences of some patients, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, which includes its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review seeks to summarize research progress in this fast-growing new subject field.
Wherever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-induced diseases, namely Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis as well as some other unanswered, but urgent questions.
According to tradition, CoV is considered a nonletal pathogen for humans, mainly causing about 15% of colds.
However, in this century, we have encountered two highly pathogenic CoVs for humans, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing outbreaks that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with horrific morbidity and mortality.
Because of this, COVID-19 is currently the third CoV outbreak in human history to be recorded.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, a CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, health care provider infections were reported, which hinted that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, a territorial quarantine was imposed in the city of Wuhan and all public transport was halted.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which is considered the initial location of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation develops very quickly, the final coverage and severity of the outbreak remains to be established.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following more updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX<0x5F>rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but especially at ages 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people are over 50 years of age, only a few are under 20 years of age, and only 14 people are under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is widespread in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive figures (R0) are 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and customized R0 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, according to the mass transportation time before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and customized mortality for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60 years), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a single strand of RNA sense.
CoVs can be divided into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein bulge or spike (S) cover binds to its cell receptors, angiotensin exchange enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by cover glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form virion-filled vesicles, which then undergo fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarity among 10 sequenced samples; the sample was taken from the location of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in a very thin part of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the protein S SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 weaker than its binding to the protein S SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are not as severe as SARS-CoV infection in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded with orf3b and proteins secreted with orf8.
The orf3b protein SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in the complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformations, is composed of dimers and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins, which is evidence for the introduction and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be used as a therapeutic target in drug filtration to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Home Origins and Intermediates
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from bats and are each transmitted to humans through weasels and camels.
Through phylogenetic comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bats-SL-CoVZX45 and bats-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate hosts that helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans are still unknown, and the route of transmission remains to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed snakes as carriers of viruses from bats to humans involving homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that pangolins, long-snouted ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine, potentially as intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of genetic homology in CoVs found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread across the genome is still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence have yet to be obtained (Fig. 3).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a disinfectant containing chlorine, pear acid, chloroform, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidin, effectively deactivated the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other previous CoV studies, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, after invading the host, the virus is recognized by the innate immune system through pattern identifier receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and type I (IFN) interferon synthesis which limits the spread of viruses and accelerates the phagocytosis of viral antigens by macrophages.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid an immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins in the battle against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T-cell function by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce large amounts of free radicals locally, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst-case scenario, compound organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by an onset cluster, is more concerning the elderly with accompanying diseases and pregnant women.
Generally, people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of getting infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent an infected person, but without symptoms, from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to the virus or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a major and early COVID-19 symptom, with or without accompanying other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, wheezing, headache, sore throat, rhinorea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's disease progresses quickly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients who have fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung imaging abnormalities, should be screened against the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, a study of family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from asymptomatic people.
Comparable to that, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also developed fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher MERS lethality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) are indicated as the main symptoms and ventilation support is needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Comparable to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached as high as 6.47 with a trust interval (CI) of 95% of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given in Table 1.
The figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has higher spread capability than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as deadly as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Clustered songs are often found in a family or from a sorority or a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with an infected person or patient in the last two weeks before the onset.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who are discharged from the hospital can carry the virus again. This raises caution to increase the time of quarantine.
In the early stages, patients have normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, which includes lymphocyte count <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels as well as viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin are elevated in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and the rate of blood sedimentation is elevated in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, levels of D-dimer increase, which is a product of the decomposition of fibrin present in the blood, and the count of lymphocytes decreases progressively.
Thoracic photo abnormalities are found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral cloudy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly aggravate gas exchange disorders.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunction lowers surfactant levels and increases surface pressure thereby lowering the lung's ability to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Because of this, the worst findings on thoracic photos are often parallel to the most severe disease rates.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of the hialin membrane, and infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes, as well as many nucleic synciial cells in the lungs of patients who died of the disease, in accordance with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS as well as similar to the pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the main criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to high levels of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurs in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a must to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group explained the protocol of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a dip stick in less than an hour without the need for complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly improve sensitivity and ease if verified in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with new CoVs, doctors primarily offer supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying various previously used or proposed therapies for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing therapies and potential therapies with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are major threats to patients and a leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with oxygenation of the extraorporeum membrane (ECMO), which is a modified cardiopulmonary shortcut technique used for the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response marked by the release of a series of cytokines, which include TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and compound organ failure.
Immunosuppression is very important in the handling of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storms include modulation of T-cell-directed immune responses; blocking IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are not useful for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Conversely, steroids can result in severe side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which greatly affects the prognosis.
However, short doses of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses are recommended to be given with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be beneficial in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition against other single-strand RNA viruses, which included MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided this compound for China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medications used by the patient should be closely monitored.
Plasma from a cured patient and antibody manufacture
There is a long history of blood collection of patients who have recovered from infectious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting the disease.
Indeed, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens as well as other foreign bodies, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 terminally ill patients.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammation and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification need to be done to apply the method for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effect, some of the shortcomings associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate an excessive immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
Antibody concentrations in the blood are usually low and plasma is needed in large quantities to treat critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or perform effective antibody filtering against proteins that are important to viruses.
This way, we can easily scale up the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of the various components in the formula. The formula varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract or verify those components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, because effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 are not yet available, TCM is one of the major alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illnesses.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule were found to be potent for COVID-19 therapy.
The top recovery rates in COVID-19 patient therapy were observed in some Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of its patients, which included Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rates (13%).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicinal therapy (WM) alone to the combined therapy of WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, loss of symptoms, and hospitalization was much shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
More impressively, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was much lower for the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and lower mortality in the WM<0x2B>TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, TCM’s efficacy and safety are still awaiting better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients feel a great fear of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also feel boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as therapeutic side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental stress.
In the early phases of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor turmoil, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality have ever been reported.
The tracking of mandatory contact history and quarantine, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more anxious and guilty about the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected people, and people contacting them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with regular and accurate updates of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapeutic plans and use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for breaking the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to vulnerable hosts and are often complementary to antiviral therapy in controlling epidemics caused by the emergence of viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop a protein-based S vaccine, which in a long-term and effective way creates antibodies to neutralize and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live-weakened vaccines have been evaluated in experimental animals.
However, the effectiveness of in vivo vaccine candidates in the elderly and their models of lethal challenges and protection against zoonotic viral infections must be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to continued zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and have been partially evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that is safe and effective for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to overcome due to the long time it takes to develop the vaccine (average 18 months) and dynamic CoV variations.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show its full clinical journey to thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can gradually recover without a sequela.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the establishment of a disease prognosis model is essential for health care bodies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurred in the ages of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients aged over 50 in the study containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who require intensive care tend to have concomitant comorbidities and complications and are significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (median age 66 versus 51), which hints at age as a prognostic factor for the final outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to develop acute heart injuries and arrhythmias.
Heart disease is also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to bind to colangiocytes with ACE2-positive, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases are highly correlated and can affect each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and is proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
Correlation between CRP levels and severity and COVID-19 prognosis has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: Photos of the thorax and the development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict the end result and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are widely used as supportive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Because high doses of corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of the disease end up suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffered tremendous stress as they had to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty as well as witness the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support should be provided to help these patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have a different epidemiological picture of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or symptomatic symptoms in the early phases of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, in the early phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which creates great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when the patient is seriously ill and most do not occur in the initial phase.
As such, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, major efforts are underway in China, which includes quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities as well as ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of cutting off the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While this action is particularly damaging to the economy and other sectors within the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates say the outbreak will end in March and the decline phase lasts for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. created a model to predict the end result of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-conka wipe and throat of patients who had recovered and returned from hospital 2 weeks earlier. This indicated that the re-identified virus could become a recurring episode, similar to influenza.
However, promising signs are taking place in China, in light of the declining number of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may work.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause one million cases with half as well as deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease can eventually be controlled.
Perhaps, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappears or becomes a less pathogenic virus that can coexist with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemics with the SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Fig. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also be through direct contact with substances contaminated by the virus.
The virus is also found in stools, giving rise to the possibility of a new transmission, feces-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study on 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may have been caused by a nosocomial infection, which included 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions should be taken to protect people, particularly health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even people who happen to be in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of both surgical masks and respirator masks N95 (series number 1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks keep the splashing of the potentially infected person from getting airborne or sticking to the surface of the material, where the splashing of the spit can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (serial numbers of the 1860s) can protect against inhalation of virions with sizes as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virions able to completely penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, both of which are about 85 nm in size.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, health care providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series number 1860s) instead of surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear a transparent face shield or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended for everyone to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay at home for self-quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet is believed to be appropriate to maintain distance from the patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should be a major warning for China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control calmed the population by saying that the new virus has low spread properties and limited reproductive capacity from human to human and prevention and containment of the disease is not a problem.
This message soothes people’s fears, especially as the whole country prepares for the Spring Festival, that this critical time is missed to stem the still-small illness in Wuhan.
The disease control agency in China should take lessons from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because every word is noticed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from the clinic rather than waiting for an official report from a doctor or authorized officer; (3) more restrictive to curb the potential of an epidemic at an early stage, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) more often issued targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of disease epidemics and testing systems.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to spread in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, the outbreak has spread across China and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of writing this review.
Because the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak gives the impression that the SARS outbreak is repeating itself.
However, there are some obvious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to stem the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and affects more men than women, and the mortality rate is also higher in older people than in younger people.
SARS mortality was higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill. This makes it more difficult to curb the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains partly why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA bases to check for SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can give positive results again to the virus screening.
These findings greatly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, some important issues still need to be resolved, namely:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there is a genetic homology of 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal is an intermediate species to transmit viruses from the original host, say bat, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut the transmission and the plague can spread again at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical origins show that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does this virus also bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic become a worldwide pandemic, end up like SARS, or repeat periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are very important, but it may take time to find them.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
The zoonotic origin of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its hosts, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses, such as colds.
An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverses the situation and reveals how highly damaging and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has put CoV in the spotlight again and surprised us with high transmission, but with lower pathogenicity than its brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infections are zoonotic. Therefore, understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoV will be beneficial for us.
Most HCoVs come from bats. In these animals, the virus is not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of several HCoVs have also been known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Investigations of CoV-inang interactions in animals can also provide important insights into CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present a general overview of the current knowledge of the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
The important thing is that we compare and contrast these HCoVs from the perspective of evolution and recombination of the genome.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements of successful host transitions and the evolutionary implications of viruses on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
The coronavirus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of sheathed, positive-sensitive, and single-stranded RNA viruses.
The virus has the largest genome with a size of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called "CoVs", due to its crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Based on its structure, CoVs have an un segmented genome that has a similar arrangement.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open-read skeletons (ORF1a and ORF1b) overlapping each other. Both are translated into polyprotein replication pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins undergo further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open read frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes a bulge or spike (S), a sheath or envelope (E), a membrane (M), and a nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complementary proteins specific to a particular lineage are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among these four genera, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoV and is further divided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the gene source for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while poultry are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and some CoVs have been important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
Conversely, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients and have a higher chance of developing into acute respiratory disorder syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the pulmonary organs.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the snot of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-relieving symptoms.
In fact, the concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infections are generally harmless, until an outbreak of SARS occurs.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most destructive outbreaks in history today, infecting more than 8,000 people with a rough mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-nCoV), subsequently called SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is already sounding and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins from bats, rats, or pets.
Much evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats. In bats, CoVs are well-adapted and nonpathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and limiting factors of displacement between species.
The study may also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediaries, and amplification of SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications in the prevention of future spread.
In this review, we provide an overview of the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenesis of HCoV.
We specifically highlight and discuss the general topic that HCoV parent viruses are usually nonpathogenic in their natural reservoirs, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to new hosts.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoVs that increased transmission capability is often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The final results of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic are also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of the first HCoV-229E strain of B814 from cold-infected patients, various CoVs had been isolated from various infected animals, which included turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV findings in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative indication.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the airways of patients who had an upper airway infection in 1966, which was subsequently adapted to be grown in the WI-38 pulmonary cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E show symptoms of colds, which include headaches, sneezing, lethargy, and sore throat, along with fever and cough seen in 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultures and series of sequential pathways in the brain of still breastfeeding mice.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogenic infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread throughout the world and tend to be most transmitted during winter in temperate climates.
Typically, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week and is followed by a period of illness for about 2 weeks.
Based on a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced mild colds.
Few patients with a weakened immune system show severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first cases of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the supercontagious, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load seen on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially develop myalgia, headaches, fever, lethargy, and chills, which are followed by dyspnea, cough, and breathing disorders as advanced symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Alveolar diffusion damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages were also observed in SARS patients.
Furthermore, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be deadly, especially in patients whose immunity is weak.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of relatives of zero patients who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus is initially very prevalent in young children, the elderly, and patients with weak immunity who suffer from respiratory diseases.
Descriptions of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explained the same viral isolation from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread throughout the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and peaks occur in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
These four community HCoVs have fully adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutating into highly pathogenic diseases. However, exceptional cases do occur for unknown reasons, as in the case of the more virulent subtype HCoV-NL63 which was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Generally, when it gains the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself in humans, the virulence and pathogenicity of HCoVs is also reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of 60-year-old patients with acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases originated in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contact have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also develop acute kidney failure, which so far only occurs in MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with high case deaths, at 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most frightening viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that an ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross case mortality rate of 3.4%.
Noteworthy, case deaths in Hubei, China, were 4.2%, while case deaths outside Hubei were 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into an acute respiratory disorder syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the homology of high nucleotide sequences, at 82%, both groups into different phylogenetic tree branches.
The pathogonicity of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, but more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms have been reported and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents a more generalized picture seen in Community HCoV infections, which includes a nonspecific picture of mild or even symptomless symptoms.
On the other hand, a small percentage of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infections even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also exhibits interesting pattern characteristics, similar to both community HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmission capability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community HCoVs.
On the other hand, the lack of transmission capability of SARS-CoV-2 after some pathways in humans still needs to be verified, as are the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from stool samples.
“Whether fecal-oral SARS-CoV-2 transmission plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, it still needs to be clarified by subsequent studies.”
It is also very important to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of community HCoVs.
However, an overview of SARS-CoV-2, which includes the ability to transmit, pathogenicity, and continuous spread across multiple pathways in humans, will greatly affect the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
Seen from another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoVs and humans may be a species of ancient HCoV pandemic survivor.
HCoVs that cause severe illness in humans and humans who suffer from severe HCoV disease have been destroyed.
In order for this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in adequate quantities to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations to counteract host restriction factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak survives and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community CoVs circulated in the human population and triggered colds in immunocompetent people.
The virus does not require an animal reservoir.
Conversely, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
Both must defend themselves and reproduce in zoonotic reservoirs and seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar picture to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community HCoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 is as easily transmitted as community HCoVs, at least nowadays.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than community HCoV and is not as pathogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will fully adapt to humans and circulate in humans without reservoir animal hosts or intermediaries.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary host, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplifier of HCoV.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoVs if they have a closely related ancestor and share a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
Ancestral viruses usually adapt well and are nonpathogenic in this host.
Similarly, reservoir hosts carry HCoV sustainably and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the host is infected naturally and is a natural host for HCoV or parent viruses.
Conversely, if the new HCoV enters the intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters the human, the virus has not adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and acts as an amplifier host by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate, then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV can develop a dead end infection if it is unable to maintain its transmission in an intermediate host.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveals retrospectively that zero cases of SARS have a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies indicated that the sellers of the animal had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Moonworms (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market were the first to be identified carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS have been reported since all the weasels in the market were killed.
Nonetheless, it is reported that lunar weasels from wildlife or farms that are not exposed to the live animal market largely yield negative test results for SARS-CoV. This suggests that lunar weasels may only act as an intermediate amplifying host, but not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It should be noted, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that perhaps many small mammal species also serve as the intermediate amplifier host of SARS-CoV.
All of these hosts appear to be late hosts of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV further revealed a closely related bat CoV, called the Rhinolopus bat CoV relative-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This CoV and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
The study became the foundation for a new concept that bats are hosts to emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) are also identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The enzyme angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from a sample of bat stools was shown using ACE2 bats, weasels, and humans as receptors for entry into cells.
Interestingly, serum convalescent SARS patients can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestry to SARS-CoV in bats, with a nucleotide sequence homology of 95%.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is commonly believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not a direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as the way in which the virus enters.
The RNA polymerase-dependent sequence of MERS-CoV RNA is phylogenetically closer to its equivalent in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Because of this, bats may not be direct reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab camels yield seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like camels of Middle Eastern origin in some African countries.
MERS-CoV life identical to the virus found in humans is isolated from the nasal wedge of Arab camels. This further indicates that camels are the actual reservoir hosts for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with usually mild symptoms was observed in camel experiments infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be noted that infected camels shed the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of viral decay from bats.
However, the question remains unanswered as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or an unknown transmission route involving an unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with the RaTG13 bat CoV isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequencing difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to establish a parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2, unless an almost identical bat CoV is discovered later in life.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal hosts are among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Many early cases of COVID-19 are linked to this market, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequences suggest that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolins (Sweet javanica), may also carry ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
This new pangolin CoV genome shares 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
The two are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like viral sublines in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.
Notably, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much different, although the whole genome's sequencing homology levels are higher.
Previous studies of sick pangolins also reported detection of contig viruses from lung samples, which were also related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted different methods of preparation and manual curation to produce partial genome sequences consisting of about 86.3% complete viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility of pangolins as one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from pangolins due to the sequencing differences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins, and other mammals remains to be established.
Although the highest sequencing homology in RBD is found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest sequencing homology in the entire genome.
It is too speculative to say that high levels of similarity between the RBD beta-CoV relative-SARS-CoV-2 pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 are driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The counter hypothesis supports recombination between the relative beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 pangolins and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary driving factor, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs.
Researchers have yet to determine the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have been derived from bat CoVs, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American three-color bats showed close kinship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to other bat CoVs, under the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae allegedly also being its intermediate host.
To be clearer, current knowledge of the known animal origin of HCoV is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoV in history.
Around 1890, when HCoV-OC43 passed species from livestock to infect humans, a pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
Alpha-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between the two, there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Some evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, who may be in contact with bats in shared ecological niches.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Secondly, alpha-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E are diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpha-CoV alpacas cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Lastly, alpha-CoV alpacas are not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaca getting alpha-CoV relatives-HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source for human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while alpha-CoV bats serve as the gene outlet of HCoV-229E, alpacas and Arabian camels may serve as intermediate hosts transmitting the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at the earliest identification of the virus and is also reinforced by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats are a rich drainage species of viruses for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and transmission between species.
Long life, well-established colonies, close social interactions, and strong flying abilities are all supporting conditions for bats to become ideal ‘virus spreaders’.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arabian camels for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have changed from intermediate hosts to stable and natural reservoir hosts.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans occurs by chance and humans remain the final host for MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike camels' role in MERS-CoV transmission, pangolins' role, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
In particular, beta-CoV pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Pangolin may be the final host for a SARS-CoV-related beta-CoV-2, similar to a weasel in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, some possible interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animal to human should be taken into account or ruled out.
First, the bat could have been a reservoir host for a relative SARS-CoV-2 virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological niches with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could have been one of the intermediate amplifier hosts for the newly-introduced SARS-CoV-2 relative virus.
Humans get the virus through slaughter and meat consumption.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody surveys of pets and wild animals need to be carried out.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal origin is ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, the three main factors of the viral side are also important to make it easier for CoVs to cross the species barrier.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutation can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of <0x7E>10-4 per year per site, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to the new host.
CoVs have an exoribonuclease correction, removal that results in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the Remdesivir nucleotide analogue is known to suppress CoV replication through the inhibition of this exoribunuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than the rate of its host mutation.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoV has not adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV that has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is actually lower, signaling a higher rate of adaptation with humans.
It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoVs that have adapted to Arab camels.
Theoretically, it is less likely that genetic drift will quickly make vaccines and antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by the number of unique open reading skeletons and protein functions encoded towards the end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replication through a unique "select-copy" mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixing containers, strand transitions often occur during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Complete and highly homologous subgenomic RNAs can undergo recombination to form new CoVs.
Natural recombination phylogenetic evidence has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
The interaction of viruses in relation to transmission
In addition to the aforementioned three viral factors, the interaction of the virus with host receptors is another major factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV isolates and weasels, SARS-CoV is suspected of rapid adaptation in a variety of hosts, particularly with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and is intensively targeted for host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its receptors as the way in which the virus enters.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors of a variety of animals, which include bats, weasels, rats, and raccoon dogs, thus enabling the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to differ between human and weasel virus isolates in RBD and 4 of them are located in receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The weasel SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of bulge protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be essential for the adaptation of viruses to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptors as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies the affinity of the S protein binding to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed the affinity of human ACE2 binding and S SARS-CoV-2 proteins was 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV proteins.
It is also important to know whether there are other receptors that may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-teracetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cell receptors, the end result of interspecies HCoV transmission is also governed by dependency factors and other host restrictions.
These differences in host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arab camels, and rodents can be barriers to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must take over the host dependency factor and break into the host restriction factor in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, these important molecular determinants in the field of viral-intangible interaction still have to be identified and characterized.
Filtering the entire genome unbiasedly to look at the dependency factors and host limitations of SARS-CoV-2 using state-of-the-art CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
The emergence of new HCoVs: back to the beginning of the outbreak
The diversity of bat CoVs provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this case, bat CoVs function as the gene drainage HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a new protein encoder gene has the potential to drastically modify the viral phenotype.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans because the isolated kin-SARS-CoV bat virus was found to encode a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with the characteristic removal of 29 nucleotides was found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation supporting host transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineages, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in RNA polymerase dependent RNA.
The recombination location is also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, the occurrence of recombination between various lineages is shown to occur in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurs in Arabian camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs where HCoVs are recombined with other animal CoVs in their nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes in the viral genome, most likely resulting from the release of the virus from the pressure of the selection experienced, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 on the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to the removal of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpacas show single nucleotide inserts resulting in skeletal shift.
Lastly, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure in its reservoir hosts.
Mild or symptomless symptoms are detected when bats are infected with CoV, which indicates mutual adaptation between CoV and bats.
It seems that bats adapt well to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in activating the proinflammatory response in bats will decrease the pathology triggered by CoV efficiently.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to increased regulation of NKG2/CD94 inhibitory natural killer cell receptors and low class I class complex molecular expression levels of histocompatibility.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from high bat metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and affect correction by exoribonucleases thus putting selective pressure for the creation of highly pathogenic strains of viruses as they enter the new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also develop through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
CoVs replicate strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where the secret lies in the presence of symptomless carriers and the cause of severe cases of human infection.
Symptoms are severe mainly due to excessive activation of the immune response as well as cytokine storms, with pulmonary damage getting worse if the immune response gets stronger.
Conversely, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is already detached from CoV replication.
The same strategy for deciding the correlation of the immune response may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of interferon type I, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
For this reason, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition with MCC950 may be beneficial in handling COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general flow of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoVs that share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoVs have been found, there are also bat CoVs that share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although weasels and other animals in the market were found to carry a virus identical to SARS-CoV, a direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
A highly homologous pangolin beta-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, suggesting that pangolin may act as either an intermediate host or beta-CoV pangolin may contribute gene fragments to the late version of SARS-CoV-2.
There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans either intentionally or accidentally.
CoV is again at the center of attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs for HCoVs on human transmission.
Very much evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection stems from contact between humans and wet wet wet markets, it may be the closing of wet markets and the killing of all wet wet weed in it that effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins were supposed to be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several lineages of pangolins beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in Arabian camels.
These camels serve as an important means of transportation as well as as a major source of meat, milk, skin, and wool products for the local community.
Arab camels are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we are unlikely to kill all camels to control MERS, as is done in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop a vaccine for camels that is effective against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we can successfully eliminate this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause outbreaks.
Various zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, potentially zoonotic bat CoVs are very diverse.
There are many possibilities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and undergo recombination, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experiences of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and countermeasure plans should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet since a long time ago.
These viruses are in their natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that support the spread of the virus, the chances of humans getting in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from wild animals.
Continuous surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to maintain distance from the natural zoonotic virus's ecological niche reservoir.
Some parts of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not been discovered.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral virus SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, the conditions when bats and pangolins share ecological niches are important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans come into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as an actual intermediate host, the way it interacts with other species, including humans, bats, and pangolins, must be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental and surveillance infections should be carried out.
Whether bats, pangolins, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its virtually identical parent virus can be identified in its natural host in the future.
Continuing research in this field will outline the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the "expected case" and "confirmed case" COVID-19 diagnostic criteria needs to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 (2019-nCoV) new coronavirus infections. This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference for fighting pandemics around the world.
Nevertheless, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is increasingly based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and handling strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we answer one of the comments in our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "expected cases" and "confirmed cases" based on the Diagnosis and Handling Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
By December 2019, the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had caused an outbreak, which is currently formally called the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasingly increasing based on ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnosis and handling strategies are also constantly updated.
As an example of the Diagnosis and Handling Guide for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts changed quite a lot.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guidance as well as a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also requires updates based on the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Handling Guidelines (the seventh version of the trials) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case it is necessary to combine one picture of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to fulfil three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or living in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test) and a history of contact with patients who have fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the symp.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) features imaging of COVID-19 infections; (3) total white blood cell counts indicate normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte counts in the early onset stage.
Diagnosing confirmed cases should be based on suspected cases with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) whole viral genome sequences show high homogeneity for known new coronaviruses; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and positive antibodies of IgG<0xE2><0x88><0x92>CoV-2 in serum tests; or changes in antibody
We can see that real-time PCR tests of nucleic acids in respiratory tract or blood samples were added in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
Pathogenic detection in blood samples was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then, serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the researchers' ongoing research to find the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the airways including blood extraction, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the inclusion of positive results of certain antibodies into confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is an increasing amount of evidence reminding us to be wary of patients with atypical and symptomless symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in future practice and clinical studies.
In conclusion, we expect more direct evidence to appear and ask readers to comment.
For the diagnosis of "expected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend following and complying with the latest guidelines in their respective countries.
Our team will also update our guide periodically as help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death toll in one day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of recorded cases of infections including 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Road and Bridge Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be halted longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport stop has been started since March 26 and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of basic goods -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded incidence of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, at two people who had just returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three men had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
As of Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections surpassed one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths are linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The peak came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries to remain free of coronavirus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there have been more than 244,000 cases of the coronavirus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Agency reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. due to coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the region's quarantine until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians would be paid without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions, and one vote rejected.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to a full day; previously, the curfew was only valid between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement curfews between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended a stay at home order until May 1.
Shops in Australia lower toilet paper purchase limit per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoons, the network of Australian stores Woolworth and Coles respectively lowered the limit on toilet paper purchases to two and one pack per transaction in all stores at a national level.
ALDI also imposed a one pack limit, on Monday.
This restriction was announced as a message on the cashier and on the Facebook page of his network.
Buyers reportedly piled up supplies due to the fear of COVID-19 in case the public had to perform self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
This change follows a four-pack per transaction restriction previously implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
In his media statement on March 8, Coles reported that with the imposition of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still running out within an hour of delivery", and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unprecedented".
Sales "sharply increased" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco stores in Canberra also limited the allowable amount to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packaging from suppliers and increased frequencies of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers were trying to increase inventories, but local government agencies' restrictions on truck delivery times made it difficult.
He anticipated an increase in production costs, as suppliers sought to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because it had released supplies early, some stores were unable to hold special Wednesdays.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores fill in supplies every night.
He emphasized that toilet paper is such a large volume item that the quantity of supplies is low and, if sold out, makes a lot of empty space on the shelves so that the scarcity of goods is increasingly felt.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there’s a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and sanitizer can be [bought] and exist in large quantities, panic may be minimized, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News Agency.
The manufacturer of recyclable toilet tissue Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were running out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleenex Toilet Towels, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, stressed they were working 24/7 to keep supplies, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers offered free toilet paper to the first bidder of an auction in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held as buyers took a break for the long Labor Day weekend break.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Shops are actually reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, they said they do not plan to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitizers, dry foods, handwashing soap, and flour.
Similarly outside of Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British online supermarket Ocado was observed limiting Andres’ toilet paper purchases to two packs containing 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak—a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus—as a pandemic.
While the word "pandemic" refers only to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If a country detects, tests, handles, isolates and mobilizes its people in response, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
We are very concerned both because of the alarming rate of spread and severity as well as because of the alarming rate of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "aside from influenza, no respiratory tract virus has ever been traced from its emergence to a sustained global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status of the pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January that declared the outbreak an emergency of public concern that alarmed the world.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, “In essence, it will worsen.”
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is a ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a World Disturbing Public Health Emergency on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in an estimated 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
Case fatality is estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide ranges from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth while coughing, keeping away from others, and monitoring and self-isolating people who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by enforcing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control, and closures of facilities.
The pandemic has caused severe global socio-economic disruptions, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports activities, and the extent of scarce supply of goods aggravated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed at both national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the worldwide student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, people with East and Southeast Asian ancestry and appearance, and people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of travel reductions and heavy industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province), reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and therefore the virus is suspected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus causing the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus and is related to the bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to have fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and the person has no clear link with the later mentioned wet market cluster.
Among the initial case clusters reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be linked to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case that can be traced to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was likely the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with new cases reported declining in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China has surpassed the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, particularly among people with milder symptoms.
As of February 26, a relatively small number of reported cases among youth, with people aged 19 and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide. The chief UK scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the UK population needs to be infected before group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetectable, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be greater than reported cases.
The initial estimate of the basic reproductive figure (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure is likely to be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers are cured.
For those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occur in people over 60 years of age and 75% have pre-existing health disorders, which include cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official calculation of deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to people who died giving positive test results for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of fatalities caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, given that official figures may not include people who died without being tested, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the surplus number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded official COVID death calculations by a factor of 4-5 times.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted, "We know [the announced number of deaths] is lower than the actual number", a statement reinforced by non-scientific reports of too low calculations in the U.S. The overly low calculations often appear in pandemics, such as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of mainland China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent, except Antarctica. In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This number varies by region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time since the first outbreak, and the character of the population such as age, gender, and overall health. The mortality ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the mortality to case ratio globally is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) as of April 10, 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the estimated mortality-to-case ratio decreased from 17.3% (for people with onset of symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other measurements include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die from certain diseases, and the number of fatalities of infections (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnos and undiagnosed)
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population ranging from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates infection fatality rates for the pandemic as a whole between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this range of estimates is in line with the results of the first randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on CFR estimates.
WHO insists that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are unclear and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Without control, infectious outbreaks are usually horizontal and then begin to decline as the disease runs out of available hosts.
However, it is almost impossible to make a plausible projection today about when it happened".
Senior Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "the outbreak may end in June" if the entire country could be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on rare measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene <0x26> Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for up to a year or two."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures will be required "until vaccines are available (probably 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's less likely that this coronavirus, because it's so easily transmitted, can disappear entirely" and the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
The repetition virulence will depend on the immunity of the group and the rate of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and an infected person can be without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory sputum (flegma), loss of olfactory power, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptisis, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing, depressed chest or sedentary chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and bluishness on the face and lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear. Further development of the disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming the infection, researchers suggest that those in close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and checked to make sure they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate the asymptomatic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The incubation period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimated number of COVID-19 sufferers who lost their sense of smell initially 30%, then decreased to 15%.
Details of how the disease spread are still being investigated.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to mainly occur during close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that uncovered coughs can cause droplets to be pushed 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that survive longer in the air and are produced when speaking. Respiratory droplets may also be produced when exhaling, including when speaking, although these viruses are not generally transmitted through the air.
Droplets can fall in the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make respiratory secretions turn into aerosols and then spread through the air.
The spread can also occur when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
While there are concerns that the virus can spread through stools, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and at further stages of the disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting transmission may occur before significant symptoms.
Few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases have been reported, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus can persist on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day on cardboard, and more than four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities advise to wash hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that an infected person may have already touched.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All hallmarks of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are related to coronaviruses in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus can be destroyed if exposed to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to early SARS-CoV.
Viruses are thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronaviruses are genetically classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B) along with two strains of bat-derived strains.
The virus has a 96% similarity across the entire genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the pangolin virus and the human virus.
To date, the comparison of the entire genome found the most 92% common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that pangolin is the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by a virus can be temporarily diagnosed based on symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately done through a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on an infected secretion or via CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first distributed on January 17.
Testing uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on breathing or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is performed on a nasopharyngeal swab, but a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to be widely approved.
In the US, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of radiographic imaging and computed tomography (CT) in people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral glass ground opacity and no pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is putting together an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Because of overlap with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging without PCR confirmation has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although less specific for infections, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is advisable to be considered as a filtering tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining a comprehensive personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and wearing wipes when coughing or sneezing and immediately throwing tissue into the trash.
People who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical restriction measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Governments in various regions have restricted or urged to stop all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a community-scale spread stage in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some members of the public do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers dealing with people who may be infected are advised to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The government’s use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has sparked privacy concerns, with the release of a statement from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for such surveillance restrictions.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user proximity to other phones.
Furthermore, users will receive a message if they are close to someone who tested positive for COVID-19. circulating misconceptions about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after from the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; as well as after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soaps that damage its protective layer.
Furthermore, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60% based on volume when soap and water are unavailable.
WHO recommends that people do not touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (within a minute of disinfectant exposure to stainless steel surfaces), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidin gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in public facilities, such as offices or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by the sufferer, be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with bent elbows or use tissue when coughing or sneezing, then immediately remove tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and mileage of expiratory droplets spread while speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to wear the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “wearing masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch faces with insufficiently clean hands, which is the main source of transmission.”
The WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as people who treat COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to encourage the use of masks to members of the public.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of fabric. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to healthy communities, especially when close to (1 metre (3 ft) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned people from going out in public without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires everyone entering the store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all its citizens to wear face masks while in public.
Taiwan, which produces ten million masks a day since mid-March, requires train and intercity bus passengers to wear face masks as of April 1.
Panama requires the use of face masks every time outside the home, as well as recommends the creation of homemade face masks for those who cannot afford face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restriction (also called physical restriction) is an infection control measure intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social restrictions include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply social restrictions by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and maintaining physical distance from others.
Today, many governments require or call for social restrictions in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced, from 250 people (if not known to have spread COVID-19 in a region) to 50, and then to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. Elderly and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and impaired immune system who have a risk of serious disease and higher complications are advised CDCs to keep as far as possible at home alone in areas experiencing outbreaks at the community level. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies are starting to change the term "social limits" to "virtual limits"
The use of the term "social restriction" gives the impression that people should isolate themselves completely socially and not encourage people to stay in touch with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during pandemic times.
These recommendations include advice to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or viral symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people who are suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments require or recommend self-quarantine for all populations living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions were issued for people belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to countries or regions with a wide spread of COVID-19 are advised to quarantine independently for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies in epidemic control are containment or suppression, as well as mitigation.
The prevention is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people as well as to take other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease throughout the population.
When it is no longer possible to stem the spread of the disease, subsequent efforts move to the mitigation stage: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care systems and the public.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive rate to less than 1.Part of the management of infectious disease outbreaks is attempting to lower the epidemic peak, which is known to overturn the epidemic curve.
This lowers the risk of being overwhelmed by health care and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Nonpharmaceutical interventions to deal with outbreaks include individual precautions, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; measures at the community level aimed at physical restrictions, such as closing schools and cancelling mass gatherings; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as measures at the environmental level, such as surface cleansing. Other drastic measures aimed at curbing outbreaks are being carried out in China as far as the pandemic.
Other countries have also implemented various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass censorship and local quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people who are quarantined independently and imposes large fines for people who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished hoarders of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States showed that mitigation (slowing down, but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) had major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the peak demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overcrowded health systems.
Suppression can be chosen, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this is the first to be achieved), because otherwise the transmission will surge back rapidly as the suppression measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic have had a social and economic impact.
No specific antiviral drugs have yet been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, which include testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter flu medications, drinking enough water, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the condition of the patient.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some "traditional and home-based treatments" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is a basic step in responding to the outbreak.
The ECDC and the European regional WHO office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to shift resources at various levels, including focusing on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, where possible cancelling elective procedures, separating and isolating patients positively from COVID-19, and improving intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A cluster of pneumonia with an unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was handled by doctor Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, which informed CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for warnings he issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31 and notified the WHO.
Quite a few unidentified cases of pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan which then triggered an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during the Lunar New Year and because Wuhan is a major transportation hub and railway transit venue.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Official data further show that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms as of January 20, 2020.As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area restrict free movement and make border controls.
National responses include containment measures, such as quarantine (known as housekeeping orders, shelter orders in place, or region quarantines) and curfews. On April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were in a kind of quarantine region in the United States, more than 50 million people were in quarantine region in the Philippines, about 59 million people were in quarantine region in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a quarantine state, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later, accounting for about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report showed the earliest cases on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause on Dec. 26; this observation was notified of his hospital to CDC Jianghan on Dec. 27.
Early genetic testing of samples of patients on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The announcement to the public was released by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31.
Who was notified on the same day.
When this notice was implemented, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In a quarantine called "the largest quarantine in human history", the cordon sanitaire was announced on Jan. 23 to stop travel in and out of Wuhan, and expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
Private vehicle use is prohibited within the city.
The Lunar New Year celebration (January 25) is cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was also built thereafter, Leishenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospital, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government drafted further measures to stem the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for tourists and extending the Spring Festival holidays.
All universities and schools in the country are also closed.
Hong Kong and Macau have implemented several measures, particularly in terms of schools and universities.
Measures to work remotely are applied in some areas of China.
Travel restrictions are imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Controls of public movements are implemented in many cities, and an estimated 760 million people (more than half of the population) face some sort of restrictions outside the home. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent "importing" the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international tourists entering the city. On 23 March, the only case of mainland China was transmitted domestically five days earlier, in this case through a tourist returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted domestically had been essentially blocked and the outbreak had been controlled in China.
Travel restrictions on the same day were relaxed in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the region's quarantine was enacted. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from March 28 onwards, without any specific details on the timing of this policy will expire.
People wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at the Chinese embassy or consulate.
On March 30, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen and provide monetary stimulus packages for companies. The State Council announced a day of mourning by starting a three-minute national silence on April 4 at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay online respects with regard to physical restrictions to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
On January 20, 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea from China.
On February 20, the state health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, largely due to a meeting of a new religious movement in Daegu, known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
Shincheonji believers who visited Daegu from Wuhan are thought to have originated the outbreak.
As of February 22, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13% had reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest alert level on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 by February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after testing confirmed that three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected and altered. South Korea introduced a program considered to be the world's largest and best-organized program to filter viruses in the population, isolate every infected person, as well as track and quarantine people with whom they came in contact.
Censorship methods include the obligation of reporting symptoms independently by people who have recently arrived from abroad via a mobile app, testing the virus with the results available the next day, and an increase in testing capability to more than 20,000 people each day.
The South Korean program was considered successful in controlling the outbreak although it did not quarantine the entire city. Initially, South Korean views were divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for impeachment against President Moon over their claims that the government made a mistake in handling the outbreak, or vice versa, praising the president's reaction.
On March 23, South Korea reported having the lowest total one-day cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1 all new arrivals from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 countries.

Iran is allocating five trillion reals to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine the region affected by the outbreak, only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit intercity travel were announced in March, although heavy intercity traffic ahead of the Persian New Year continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020.After China, Iran became the epicenter of the spread of the virus during February.
Amid claims that the outbreak rate in Iran was covered up, more than ten countries traced their cases back to Iran on February 28, suggesting that the outbreak rate may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government at that date.
Iran's parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reportedly tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to release unconditionally the rights defenders detained for peaceful protests and, temporarily, release all eligible detainees.
It was stated that there was a greater risk for spread in closed institutions such as detention centers, which also did not have adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number in the country since the beginning of the outbreak.
As of March 17, at least 12 Iranian politicians or officials in office have died of the disease.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be eased for countries affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Later, a cluster of unrelated COVID-19 cases were detected, beginning with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new law to curb the outbreak, which included quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different cities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the area of the outbreak, people are not allowed to go in and out.
Suspension of work activities and sporting events has been ordered in the area."On March 4, the Italian government ordered the total closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Series A football matches, will be held in secret until April, but on March 9, all sports are fully suspended for at least one month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activities, except for supermarkets and pharmacies.

As of April 5, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 cases recovered in Italy, with most of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report said that what contributed to the high fatality rate was a combination of a large Italian elderly population and the inability to test all people infected with the virus.
Initially, the UK’s response to the virus was one of the most slack among the affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the UK government did not impose any social restrictions or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for being deemed less responsive and less intense in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement calling for a halt to all travel and non-essential social contacts and suggested that people work from home, if possible, as well as avoid places such as pubs, restaurants, and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all recreational venues, such as pubs and fitness centers, should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages to the <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month limit to prevent unemployment in crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced stricter social restrictions measures, which prohibit meetings of more than two people and limit travel and outdoor activities only for activities deemed to be very important.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police through the granting of fines and the dissolution of the group.
Most businesses are ordered to close, except for businesses deemed "essential", which include supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations, and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control, the leading U.S. government public health agency, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
However, the United States was slow to begin testing so it blurred the actual outbreak rate at the time.
Testing was confused by defective testing equipment produced by the federal government in February, lack of federal approval for nongovernment testing equipment (by academics, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people eligible for testing until early March (a doctor's order is required thereafter).
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been carried out.

Belgium also recalled 100,000 unusable masks, which are thought to have originated in China, but are actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the Chinese government's efforts in managing and stemming the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak when Chinese authorities were accused of covering up thus hindering preventive and containment efforts and the current crisis with the central government "providing regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday".
On January 23, in reaction to the central government's decision to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea said that while the move was "clearly not a WHO recommendation," it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to containing the epidemic in the place of the sixth outbreak since the World Health Organization's most concentrated year" and he called it "an unprecedented increase in public health history".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was declared due to the "risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries that do not yet have a qualified health system.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to impose measures that disrupt international travel and trade unnecessarily" as well as "the WHO does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement."
On February 5, WHO called on the global community to contribute <0x24>675 million to fund strategic readiness in low-income countries, citing the urgency to support countries that "have no systems to detect people infected with the virus if the outbreak spreads."
Furthermore, Tedros made the statement that "the limits of our strength are on the weakest chains" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later in life." In a press conference on February 11, WHO designated COVID-19 as the name of the disease for the virus.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to give "a response in the form of an all-energy deployment of the UN system".
Then, the UN enables the Crisis Management Team to enable coordination of the entire UN response, which according to WHO will enable them to “focus on health responses, while other institutions can use their expertise to bear the impact of outbreaks in the broader social, economic, and developmental areas.”
On February 14, a Joint Mission Team with China led by WHO was activated; this team aims to provide international experts and WHO personnel in China in order to assist domestic management as well as evaluate "the severity and transmission of disease" by holding workshops and meetings with related national-level agencies and to conduct field trips to assess the "impact of countermeasures at the provincial and regency level, which includes urban and rural order."On February 25, WHO stated
In response to the growing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that a global coronavirus threat assessment would be raised from “high” to “very high”, this is the highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
In a statement, Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergency program, warned that, “It’s time every government on the planet faces the reality: Awake.
The virus is likely to come to your place and you have to be ready," and urges that appropriate countermeasures can help the world avoid "the worst".
Furthermore, Ryan stated that current data does not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration means "essentially we accept that every human being on the planet will be exposed to the virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO director-general said that the WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming extent of spread and severity, as well as the alarming degree of inaction."The WHO received scathing criticism for its inadequate handling of the pandemic, which included delays in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.
One of the harsh reactions included a petition signed by 733,000 people as of April 6, addressed to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to submit his resignation.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respecting the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts states that everyone is entitled to lifesaving interventions and the government assumes responsibility for this.
The group emphasizes that a lack of resources or health insurance should not be used as a justification for discriminating against certain groups.
Experts underline that every individual has a right to health, including the disabled, minority groups, the elderly, internal refugees, homeless people, people living in very poor conditions, people in prisons, refugees, and other groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are seeking to address the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a program to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, along with perspectives and suggestions.
From policies to strengthening the world’s health and economic systems to addressing the impact of territorial quarantines and travel restrictions, digital centers include State Policy Trackers, and aim to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a coordinated global response in the face of coronavirus challenges.
The Chinese government received criticism from the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for handling the pandemic that began in China's Hubei province.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been dismissed over the handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political institution's response to the outbreak in the region.
Some commentators believe the move is intended to protect Chinese Communist Party secretary-general Xi Jinping from public outrage over the coronavirus outbreak.
Several Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected previous recognition of the coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" and said that "China's cover-up actions empower the virus that has now turned into a global pandemic." This word was eventually criticized by some critics as racist and "distracting attention from his administration's failure to deal with the coronavirus."
The Daily Beast got a U.S. government message outlining the communications strategy and clearly originated in the National Security Council, with the strategy cited as "All about China.
We are told to try and deliver this message in any possible way, including press conferences and appearing on television."Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claim that China's efforts to send aid to virus-affected countries are part of a propaganda drive to influence the world.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there were "geo-political components, which include a battle for influence through fact-turning and 'political generosity'."
Borrell also said that, "China aggressively encourages the message that, unlike the US, they are responsible and reliable partners."
China also called for the U.S. to lift sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, as well as reportedly sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting aid aimed at other countries to their own countries.
There have also been reported mask-related disputes between other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey took hundreds of ventilators aimed at Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responds bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin deployed Russian soldiers to send military medical personnel, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid "is useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of carrying out “geopolitical and diplomatic” attacks.
Lombardy's president, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo planes containing medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering aid to colleagues in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that if U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials get a chance, they will also be able to retaliate if necessary."
NATO's planned "Defender 2020" military exercises in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO war exercises since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary-General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign Kate Hudson criticized the 2020 Defender exercises: "In the current public health crisis, these exercises are not only endangering the lives of U.S. troops and many participating European countries, but also residents of the countries in which they operate."The Iranian government was severely affected by the virus, with about two dozen MPs infected along with fifteen political figures today or before.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and said that his country had difficulty fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts suspect it could negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at a government-appointed location.
Initially, South Korea’s views were divided over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions, both calling for Moon's impeachment, based on their claims about the government's mismanagement of the outbreak, as well as praising his response. The pandemic has allowed many countries to respond by passing emergency laws.
Some commentators expressed concern that it could allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament and elections, as well as punish people considered to be spreading false information about the virus and handling the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus outbreak is blamed for a lack of supply, which stems from an increase in the use of equipment globally to fight the outbreak, panic-stricken purchases, and disruption of factory operations and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruptions.
Some areas are also experiencing purchases due to panic which results in a vacancy of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, triggering shortages of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100 times.
The demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and a delay in the supply of medical goods for four to six months.
It also leads to a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and the WHO warns that this will endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in a shortage of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were spared food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against the illegal hoarding and trade of important products were successful so that acute food shortages anticipated would occur in Europe and North America could be avoided.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not seen a significant decline, but prices can rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves are found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials release pork reserves to ensure people's nutritional adequacy.
A similar law exists in Italy, which requires food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
The global economic downturn has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was severely hit in the first two months of 2020 as government measures were taken to contain the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Because mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the virus outbreak is thought to be causing a major threat of destabilization to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the market will remain volatile until there is a clearer picture of the potential outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of the economic downturn caused by the epidemic on global growth could surpass the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate from experts at Washington University in St. Louis said the outbreak had an impact of more than <0x24>300 billion on the world's supply chains, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was reported to be “in a mess” after petroleum prices fell sharply as demand from China declined.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S<0x26>P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded the sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
The three stock indices closed the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the Chinese government's credit rating, but maintained the Negative Outlook.
Shares plummeted again due to fears of coronavirus, the biggest drop on March 16.
Many people think an economic recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of central and state banks.
The central banks reacted faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and government actions that restrict travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to lack of demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the shipping line industry is at a level never seen before.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Lunar New Year holidays.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by the central and local governments, including the annual Lunar New Year festival, and private companies also independently shut down shops and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Chinese New Year events and attractions are closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibits.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities, and territories, authorities extended the New Year’s holiday to February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions are the producers of 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong is raising its infectious disease countermeasures to the highest levels and declaring a state of emergency, closing schools until March, and cancelling New Year celebrations. The retail sector is affected globally due to reduced working hours or temporary closure.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50–60% decline.
It also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world are implementing additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check buyer temperatures, and cancellation of events. According to estimates by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-induced recession could cause people living in extreme poverty in Latin America to grow between 14 and 22 million compared to the situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of China's 300 million rural migrant workers are either displaced at home in the inland province or trapped in Hubei province. As of March 2020, over 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates, the coronavirus outbreak can lead to the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%. Region quarantine in India causes tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. Survey from Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of households in Canada experienced some sort of job loss. Nearly 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the region quarantine in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit schemes. Nearly half a million companies in Germany submitted government-subsidized short-term employment schemes for their employees, called Kurzarbeit.
The German short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Worldwide, the performing arts and cultural heritage sectors are impacted greatly by the pandemic, which affects the operation of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and self-employed.
Organizations of the arts and culture sector seek to uphold their mission (often publicly funded) to provide cultural heritage access to the community, maintain the safety of employees and the community, and support artists whenever possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at varying levels, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were put in place to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another detrimental impact of the latest and very fast-growing disease was the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, as well as fashion shows.
The film industry was also disrupted. The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which falls on the last week of the Lent Christian conversion season, was cancelled.
Many dioceses encourage Christian seniors to stay home and not attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provide church services via radio, online or television live broadcasts, while others offer drive-in or lantatur worship.
With the closure of churches and chapels by the Roman Catholic Diocese and the vacancy of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
Iran's health ministry announced Friday prayers were cancelled in areas affected by the outbreak and places of worship were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and residents to the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events are cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak messed up the plans of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but will not be more than the summer of 2021."Across the globe, casinos and other gaming venues are closed and live poker tournaments postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to switch to online gambling, many online gambling sites reported a significant increase in new registrations. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups postponing or cancelling concert tours.
Many large theaters such as Broadway also postpone all performances.
Artists explore various ways to continue producing and sharing work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as online live concerts or creating a web-based "festival" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publish their work.
Many coronavirus-themed Internet memes are spread online with many people turning to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as against people from affected areas in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still confined in China) noted racist sentiments expressed in groups around the world that Chinese people deserved the virus or received what they claim to be worth the reward.
Several countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination due to their area of origin.
There is already support for Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in areas affected by the virus.
Following the development of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan became a trend on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increased rates of racist abuse and assault.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus", a term that critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which borders China, and studying in major Indian cities are reported to have been abused in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Bharatiya Party President Janata state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "misguided".In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents flared up due to the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers that use paid blocking have removed them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make plague-related scientific papers available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share the results quickly on preprinted servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 viruses includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
These tests are specific and are designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA alone.
These tests are used to confirm new or still active infections.
Antibody detection (cerology) can be used for population diagnosis and surveillance.
Antibody tests show the number of people who have contracted, including people whose symptoms are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
Accurate disease mortality rates and group immunity rates in the population can be determined from the results of these tests.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has yet had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge variation in the number of tests that countries have done.
This variability may also significantly affect the number of reported cases fatality, which is most likely calculated too high in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on breathing samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal wipes or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed on a throat swab is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear in the throat as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for infected people tested in the second week, sample material can be taken from the deep airways using a suction catheter or material excreted through a cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) detector on January 28, 2020.
The device searches for the "E" gene that belongs to all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene that is specific to SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Product Administration for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 laboratory detection devices. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the 2019 ReCog International RT-Coronavirus Diagnos to Real-Co-Co-Co-Co-Co.
One in three genetic tests in the old version of the test device gave inconclusive results due to reagent errors, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully being processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was deemed unreliable until February 28, 2020, and it was not until then that state laboratories and local laboratories were allowed to conduct testing.
The test is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limits are announced; the collection and processing of specimens must be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Centre for Virology and Biotechnology Research.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for testing that could be done within 3.5 hours of high volume so that one machine could perform about 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for testing that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing that uses a technology of isothermal nucleic acid amplification that is not PCR.
Since it does not require a series of temperature cycles, this method can give a positive result in just five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates to increase production to produce 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the new coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) are being developed in Taiwan, with the hope of delivering results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid influenza test.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "the thorax photograph has a small diagnostic value at an early stage, as much as the findings of CT [computed tomography] may have existed before the onset of symptoms."
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and posterior.
The dominance of subpleura, crazy paving, and consolidation forms as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the point of origin of the current pandemic showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial filtering.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infection in individuals from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity to the disease, and in population surveillance. Examinations can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care (PoCT) testing.
High-yield automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, it is commonly used one peripheral blood specimen, although a series of specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, it is commonly used one peripheral blood specimen obtained through skin punctures.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction measures are not required before examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide notice to the agency as required and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to viruses in blood samples.
Its testing capacity is up to several hundred samples in a few hours, so it is much faster than conventional PCR examinations of viral RNA.
Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after the onset of the infection, and in early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibodies it bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong devises a scheme so that the suspected patient can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a specimen tube to the patient," they spit into it, send it back, and get the test results some time later. The British NHS announced that the NHS is pioneering a case testing scheme at home so as to eliminate the risk of patients infecting others if they come to the hospital or have to disinfect an ambulance agent if used. At the emergency COVID-19 case testing
The lattice testing center has helped South Korea perform the fastest and widest testing of any country. On March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians of Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient order and 10,700 tests had been conducted in the previous week.
The cost is covered by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of as many as 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a tour test was offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany is unknown as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples have been tested up to and including weeks 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only further testing if combined samples were found positive. In Wuhan, an emergency detection laboratory of Hu2,000
With its construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling shows that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the associated costs for quarantine handling could double if this testing capacity was not present.
Wuhan laboratories were soon followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, its total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. The open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 screenings. This balanced design can be run in small laboratories without the need for a robotic fluid handler.
Until March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents had been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers are trying to explore a sample setup protocol that involves heating the sample at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the United Arab Emirates reportedly conducted more coronavirus testing per capita of the population than any other country, and are ready to scale the test to reach most of the population.
This was achieved through a combination of tailor testing and population-scale bulk-results laboratory purchases from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of China.
Various testing prescriptions targeting various parts of coronavirus genetic profiles were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German prescription for the production of test equipment sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop itself.
German recipes were published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control were not available until January 28, thus slowing testing available in the U.S. Early on in the outbreak, China and the United States were problematic with the reliability of test equipment; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test equipment to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts testing.
On the contrary, experts say that wide availability of testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built within a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow down the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of testing awaiting work in private US laboratories, and supplies of scrap tools and chemical reagents became precarious.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems on their test equipment.
In the United States, the test equipment developed by the CDC had a "disability"; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing by private. Spain bought the test equipment from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may be the result of failure to collect samples or use the test equipment correctly.
Spain’s ministry said it would pull equipment that gave incorrect results, and replace it with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test equipment the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test equipment from China which turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that the test be dumped into the Danube river. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said the test equipment Turkey bought from China had a "high fault rate" and they did not "use it".The UK bought 3.5 million test equipment from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that it could not be used.
The test, which was followed by a quarantine of positively tested people and tracking of people who had contact with people who were positive for SARS-CoV-2, gave a positive outcome.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases found were quarantined.
With travel restrictions to these communities, new infections were eliminated altogether.
With aggressive contact tracking, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine restrictions, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than in other developed countries without extreme restrictions, such as forced closures of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened in time after the holiday on March 23.
Several other countries also handled the pandemic with aggressive contact tracking, entry travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less aggressive quarantine areas, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had much lower case fatalities, possibly because these countries were better able to detect people who had mild or symptomless symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five COVID-19 positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 referral laboratories, 7 were in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "% Test positive result" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
Countries that only test people who are hospitalized will have a higher percentage of positive outcomes than countries that test all their populations, whether they show symptoms or not, with other similar factors.
Handwashing, also called hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one’s hands to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also contract respiratory diseases, such as influenza or colds, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical moments throughout the day for hand washing with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child’s buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing meals or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not present, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal feces.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
Reduce infant mortality at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that increased hand washing practices can slightly increase the height growth of children under five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates due to respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate due to the disease by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce cases of diarrhea by about one-third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in cases of diarrhea can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ISPA), as unconscious behavior is done in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the number one cause of death of toddlers; it causes the deaths of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet becomes an embedded habit that can save more lives instead of vaccines or any medical action, and reduce diarrheal deaths by almost half and deaths by acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined along with other sanitation measures as part of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small side effect of hand washing is hand washing that often can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A study conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy and scaly skin condition, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially prevalent among health workers.
Handwashing too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing your hands with soap is important in order to reduce the transmission of fecal-oral diseases, namely: before and after using the toilet ( urination, defecation), after cleaning the child's buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or processing raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other important times to apply proper hand washing techniques to prevent the transmission of disease are before and after treating the wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal feces or handling animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is still low.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate with 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate with 23 percent. Now available some behavioral change methodologies are established in countries to increase the adoption of behavioral habits of children who wash their hands with soap at critical times. Grouped hand washing
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of appropriate measures to support the health and education of children.
Giving worm medicine twice a year, coupled with washing your hands daily with soap and brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, is at the heart of this national program.
The program has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The cleansing of microorganisms from the skin is strengthened by the addition of soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase soluble power.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic impurities, are not easily soluble in water.
However, the cleansing of fats and proteins is aided by adequate flow of water.
Solid soaps, due to their reusable properties, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies that examined the removal of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps concluded that the transfer was unlikely because bacteria were flushed with foam.
However, the CDC maintains that "liquid soaps that expend from containers without touching hands are preferred."
Antibacterial soaps are widely recommended to health-conscious communities.
To date, there has been no evidence that the recommended use of antiseptics or disinfectants is better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which have an extensive list of strains of resilient organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective substances, advanced formulations can contain acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, benzoic acid as an active antimicrobial, and further skin conditioner (crocodile tongue, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon's School of Public Health shows that ordinary soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps and consumers.
Comfortable warm water for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
Warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing natural oils that hold dirt and bacteria.
However, contrary to many people’s beliefs, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hand.
Hand sanitizers or hand antiseptics are non-water-based hygiene agents.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents in the form of non-water-based alcohol rubbers (also called alcohol-based hand rubbers, antiseptic hand rubbers, or hand sanitizers) became known.
Most of these hygiene agents are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated along with thickening materials such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into gels or along with humectants such as glycerin into liquids or foams for easy use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohols.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity further. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% alcohol are efficient germ killers.
Alcohol sanitizers rub kill bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (log reduction 3.5, similar to 35 decibel reduction) bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log reduction 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands 1 minute after use. Hand sanitizer is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis. An adequate amount of hand or alcohol rubbing antiseptics should be used to wet or cover both hands thoroughly.
The front and back of the two hands as well as on the sidelines and tips of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be washed well by rubbing them on the two palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands instead of rubbing hand sanitizers, especially when the hands look dirty.
Increased use of hygienic agents due to ease of use and rapid killing activity of microorganisms; however, hygienic agents should not be used in place of proper hand washing, unless soap and water are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused much lower skin irritation and dryness than soaps and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol hand rubbing are rare.
A lower tendency causes disturbing contact dermatitis to become an attraction of this product rather than washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-water agents do not clean hands of organic matter, but only disinfect it.
For this reason, hand sanitizer is not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still in the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is largely dependent on the ingredients and formulations, and historically, these products have significantly worse performance than alcohol and alcohol rubber.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy has been shown to be reduced after repeated use, possibly due to progressive side effects reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of the disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, if in contact with water, the ash will form an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Proper hand washing techniques based on the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for the prevention of disease transmission include the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because the residual basin may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not appear to have any effect.
Rub your hands with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than when using water alone.
Brush for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Carefully rinse under flowing water.
Washing in the basin can make your hands re-contaminated.
Dry it with a dry wipe or let it dry in the air.
Wet, moist hands are more susceptible to re-contamination. Frequently missed areas are the thumb, wrist, area between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can store microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to keep hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap water and/or soap are not available, for example, draining water from jerry or bottles that are hung and pitted and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where the water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tippy-tap", as well as other low-cost options.
A tippy tap is a simple technology that uses a water bottle suspended by a rope, a leg-operated lever to pour a little water into the hands, and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
More and more studies have shown that paper wipes are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium's paper laundry industry, to compare the hygiene levels of paper laundry, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase by an average of 194% in the knuckles and 254% in the palms.
Drying with a jet air dryer leads to an average 42% increase in the total number of bacteria in the knuckles and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in the knuckles and 77% in the palm.
The jet air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to blow microorganisms out of the hands and units and potentially contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a warm air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper wipes do not show significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
There are many hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper wipes.
Hand washing using hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was required long after the Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with the use of such devices.
Medical hand washing is done for at least 15 seconds, using large amounts of soap and water or gel to sanitize and rub each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed against each other with fingers intertwined.
If there is dirt under the nails, a feather brush can be used to remove it.
Because germs can survive in the water in the hands, the hands need to be thoroughly rinsed and dried with a clean wipe.
After drying, paper wipes are used to turn off the water tap (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoids hand recontamination from such surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care order is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of handwashing is still at an unacceptable rate in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients thereby transmitting microorganisms.
One study shows that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can lower blood flow-related catheter infection rates by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published sheets showing the standard of hand washing and hand rubs in the health care sector.
WHO hand hygiene concept guidelines can also be viewed on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of compliance with regulations is required.
The World Health Organization has “Five Minutes” to Wash Hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluid
before the asymptomatic task, and
after patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (soap "drug" or "antimicrobial") serves to kill handwashing materials.
Such killing functions may be desirable before surgery or in situations when antibiotic-resistant organisms are very prevalent. To 'rubbing' hands before surgical surgery, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching, a chlorhexidine or iodine washer, a sterile wipe to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub as well as other sterile instruments to clean under the nail.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long swiping time (10 minutes) is not required.
When rinsing, the water in the forearm should be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
After finishing hand washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical cloaks are worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use hand sanitizer before and after handling sick people.
For staphylococcal infection control in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of handwashing came from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefit gained was very little when the frequency of handwashing was increased above 35%.
Washing with regular soap results in more than three times the transmission of infectious diseases to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparisons between hand-wiping with an alcohol-based solution and hand-washing with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each show that alcohol-based hand rubbing reduces bacterial contamination 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubbing to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in the healthcare setting can involve education for staff about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubbing, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in various health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective fundamental way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water, soap, or handwashing facilities in residents’ homes, schools, and workplaces makes the goal of achieving universal handwashing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand-washing taps near private toilets or public toilets are rare, although there is an option to create a cheap handwash.
However, the low rate of handwashing can also occur due to embedded habits and not due to a lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and encouragement of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing, and result in long-term changes in population behavior.
In order to be effective, supervision and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in improving handwashing at LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of the promotion of handwashing in schools was the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF which encouraged schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one star to three.
Building a handwash can be part of a handwashing campaign that is carried out to reduce disease and child death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness-raising campaign that seeks to achieve the goal of behavioral change. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encourages the use of handwashing emojis.
Several studies examined the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries in relation to the avoidance of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of years lost due to illness.
One survey showed that encouraging handwashing with soap was significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as newly delivered mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" in England.
At the time, many people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-related infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more actively encouraging hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters of "correct hand-washing techniques" were hung next to hand-washing sinks in public toilets as well as in toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing hands of" something means expressing a person's reluctance to take responsibility for something or get involved in something.
The phrase derives from the biblical chapter in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands over the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a widely used expression in the English community.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands continuously to clean up imaginary stains; acts that show her guilt for the crime she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after recalling or contemplating unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate hand washing equipment more.
Furthermore, people who were allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation were less likely to engage in "clean" compensation actions, such as volunteering.
Religion commands hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual of hand washing in many religions, including the Bahá'í, Hindu, tevilah and yadayim netilat in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also commands hand washing for hygiene, especially after certain actions.
Hindus, Jews, and Islam are required to wash their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam require hand washing before and after meals.
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for hazard control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper hazard control in the workplace depends on the workplace and job tasks, which are based on the risk assessment of the source of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of each worker who may be susceptible to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers; for these jobs, basic infection prevention measures, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, breathing ethics, and routine cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
The work at risk of moderate exposure includes jobs that require close or frequent contact with people who are unknown or suspected to have COVID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, work environments with high population density, and high volume retail order.
Danger control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protecting against sneezing, and providing personal protective equipment when encountering COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers health workers and morgues exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 at high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens of, people known or suspected to have COVID-19.
These appropriate hazard controls for workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation chambers, and self-protection tools that fit the job tasks.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact in the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to take care of others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of the type of goods requested and how to acquire these goods (such as shopping outside rush hour, through shipping, or delivery).
Finally, shipping of goods from highly affected geographic areas can be disrupted. Preparedness and prevention plans can be used to guide protective measures.
The plan considers the level of risk associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community order, as well as risk factors for each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The plan also outlines the controls needed to address such risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness and prevention plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The targets include reducing contagion among staff, protecting people at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the measures taken.
The hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard control based on its effectiveness.
Where the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and lastly personal protective equipment.
Technical control includes isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in a work policy or procedure that requires the actions of the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (APD) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative control, but can help prevent partial exposure.
All types of APD should be selected on the basis of hazard to the worker, properly installed as applicable (e.g., respirator), worn consistently and correctly, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and properly stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs at low risk of exposure have minimal job contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent careful hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, respiratory ethics include covering coughing and sneezing, providing tissues and garbage containers, preparing work remotely or work turnover with arrival/gradual relapse times, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and routine cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-lowering drugs or other symptom-changing drugs, and that sick leave policies are flexible so that employees can stay at home to care for sick family members, and let employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, occupations at risk of moderate exposure include jobs that require close or frequent contact within six feet (1.8 metres) of a person who is unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around a business location, or because someone has just traveled internationally to a location with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in school, a work environment with high population density, and a high volume retail order. Technique control for this group and high-risk group of occupational wearables includes installing high-efficiency air filters, elevating the level of ventilation, installing physical barriers such as clear guard sneeze on the workplace, and installing windows drive-thruders on the workplacement to the workplacement, in the workplacement.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If a person falls ill in an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the other person at a distance of 6 feet, appointing one cabin crew to take care of the sick person, and offering a face mask for the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear once-in-a-lifetime medical gloves when treating a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and may be another personal protective device if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a biodanger bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard control includes delaying travel if sick, isolating, and informing the medical center on board immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up is carried out in the cabin of an isolated person. Despite the spread in the community, for schools and daycare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is a transmission in the community at a minimum to moderate level, social restriction strategies can be implemented, which include: canceling field trips, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or dining in cafeterias, increasing the distance between tables, gradual arrival and return times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high transmission in local communities, in addition to a social restriction strategy, extending school closures can be considered. For law enforcement officers who carry out daily routine activities, immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who should make contact with a confirmed or suspected person of COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect belts and duty gear before re-use by using spray or household cleaning wipes and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of used APD as well as to control and wash dirty clothing.
OSHA considers certain health workers and morgues to be at high or very high risk of exposure.
Jobs at high risk of exposure include providing health care, support, laboratories, and medical transport personnel exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This work becomes at very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens of, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive specimens retrieval.
The morgue work at high risk of exposure includes workers involved in preparing the bodies of people who are known or suspected of COVID-19 cases at the time of death; this work becomes at very high risk of exposure if workers perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for this risk group include isolation rooms for patients who are known or suspected of COVID-19, including when aerosol producing procedures are performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and morgues.
The specimen should be handled with precautions of Biological Safety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come in be separated into different waiting rooms based on if they are suspected of COVID-19 cases. In addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet of patients who are known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH approved N95 or better filter face mask respirators should be used in the context of a written and comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes conformity tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of workers. WHO does not recommend fully covered shirts or coveralls because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through body fluids.
The WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at entry points.
For people who take breathing specimens, treat, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or face shields, cloaks, and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the worldwide supply of APD is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for APD through long-distance medical services, physical barriers such as translucent windows, with only people involved in direct care can enter a room containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APD needed for a specific task, continue to use the same respirator without releasing it while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain without the masks, and not encouraging the use of people.

We find ourselves in an incredible situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is what makes clear the global human connection and the responsibilities we have with each other.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and global community building, which is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and care we have witnessed among all colleagues through email, calls, and chats is an incredible validation of the extraordinary human beings, whom we were lucky enough to work with.
My gratitude and pride are infinitely able to refer to you as co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how much it means for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful it is for this important resource to remain available online to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure the site stays on, help pay our colleagues, or help keep our community safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, especially nowadays.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, teams-c met overnight to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to keep the organization alive during this time.
We are eager to relieve the pressure and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to reduce your work schedule, that’s okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don’t set a holiday, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission requires you.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you need to take care of loved ones, shop for basic necessities, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We do not monitor your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should not be said, but we say it.
Sick leave or PTO is not required, just let your manager know and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure key areas of work can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan know in the T<0x26>C Ops so that the T<0x26>C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the proper attention from management).
Fellows whose hourly wages are based will be paid in full.
We’ve said it, and said it once again, to honor our commitment to counter-contractors and hour-based staff.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal working hours when things are normal.
This includes if you’re sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel stress on the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There are some jobs that have to go on.
SRE, HR Operations, Trust <0x26> Security, and Fundraising teams, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to supporting what is essential to our mission.
There is so much to do for all of us, we will only focus fully on the most essential projects.
Slowing down the present will be nothing for the future.
We do not plan to "overtime work catching up" after this pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet current unrealistic deadlines.
We are aware that the situation is changing and will strive to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about APP (Annual Planning)?
To adjust to new statements and daily working hours expectations, we intend to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to create a budget so that employees can prioritize important work, self-care, and care of loved ones while accommodateing those who need or want to work with fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
This timeline extension greatly reduces the workload and current planning pressures throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Board next week and will update the delegation and team on the next step as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Status, exposure, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we hired an antivirus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antiviral fluids to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floors.
The building implements its own safety assurance protocol by using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We are happy that the office will be ready for use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has shared COVID-19 protocols with us and all staff members based in DC.
As of last week, our DC office has moved into a full-fledged remote working order, in line with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we’re also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
The discussion continues, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote working colleagues realize that it may need adjustments and they would like to advise you:
Limit the duration of the meeting to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how to divide them into several days.
Define the meeting clearly, set an agenda, and send out previous reading material.
Make videos the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Appoint a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and record a list of speakers, and someone to help make a meeting note (or do a collaborative note-making).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy small meals.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel on Slack to talk to colleagues about shared work
The HR Operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomics guidelines to support increased work distributed across the Foundation.
Last week we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declared the pandemic to be over.
We inform them that we understand our requests for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete approved grant activities and that no one will be penalized for having to delay or modify such targets.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the sentiments of the entire global community seem to be of sadness as a result of this disruption, but at the same time are relieved of the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
In the future, CRT is working to set up pages on Meta-Wiki to provide space for communities to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We will send you an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take the time to connect with each other.
We are both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all other essential COVID-19-related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and ensure all information is in one place.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, major workflows, or difficulties regarding coverage, or anything else that may require help, feel free to let us know and cooperate with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and be a liaison as needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive issues, please email Bryan Judan, Director of International Human Resources Global Operations.
None of these changes are seen as a neglect of our work and obligations.
Instead, this change is an acknowledgement that, right now, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in these situations so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movement needs, and provide the world with the services they rely on.
The work we plan ahead will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for important work to come in the next few weeks and maybe the next few months.
We need all of you to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work your best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has the opposite activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of ACE2 is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a zinc-containing metaloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has a M2 terminal-N peptidase domain and a terminal-C renal colectrin amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, with enzymatically active domains exposed to cell surfaces in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular domain is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membranes of mainly type II pulmonary alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, endothelial cells of arteries and veins, and smooth muscle cells of arteries in most organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE balancer.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the amino acid phenylalanine terminal carboxyl from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradikinin, appelin, neurotensin, dynorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transporter traffic of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the S1 protein to the spike or bulge of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosome located within the cell.
The entry process of this virus also requires the priming of the S protein by host serin protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This fact makes people hypothesize that a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells may help combat infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE and ARB inhibitor therapy.
A systematic review and metaanalysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowered the risk of pneumonia in patients who had a higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust compared to the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to increase pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipoplisaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute work start in addition to the length of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation. RhACE2 infusion has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The COVID-19 app is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts to cope with the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have come into contact with infected people.
Many applications are developed or proposed, which have official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are questionable, especially with regard to systems that are based on the tracking of the geographical location of the user of the application.
Alternatives that don’t overly infiltrate privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user’s proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based app directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, have deployed an application that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 sufferers.
The app is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, it is used by an app called TraceTogether.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopCorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health care authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is still awaiting approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the contact tracking app is in an advanced development stage and will be available for deployment in a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on the Singapore TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geofencing apps for COVID-19-diagnosed patients living in Moscow; these apps are designed to ensure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, cited a number of possible practical problems with application-based systems, which include false positives and a possible lack of effectiveness if the data the application retrieves is limited to a small percentage of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple has set limits on the type of organization that could add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, restricting them only to "official" or reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates voiced their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, particularly regarding whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be discontinued once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
The organization stated eight conditions on the government project:
surveillance must be "lawful, necessary, and proportionate";
the expansion of monitoring and surveillance should have a sunset clause;
the use of data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid the worsening of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in law;
There must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
meaningful participation of all "relevant stakeholders" is required, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the issue of continuous surveillance by removing tracking mechanisms from the device’s operating system once it is no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, rather than apps, thus eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have the potential for significant privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to track contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made the location information available to the public, which is permitted with extensive changes to information privacy laws following the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany are considering using a centralized system as well as a system that protects privacy.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not been released.
Contact tracking that protects privacy is an established concept, with a large amount of research literature starting from at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record user proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, rather than a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Proximity Tracking that Protects Decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, formerly called Contact Genesis Number, CEN), Protocols and other Privacy Sensitive Mechanisms for Tracking
In this protocol, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location or data intersection grooves to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar attempt is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, the company that developed privacy technology and was originally also founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and officers without compromising the privacy of those data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that have essentially the same approach and are a much overlapping protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which are key aspects to achieving broad acceptance.
On 9 April 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also publish the specifications of the core technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be launched in three stages:
launch tool to enable government to create official coronavirus tracking app that protects privacy
The integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple are planning to address the problem of data retrieval and continuous surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates, then deleting it in the same way once the threat has passed.
A drug repositioning (also called a new goal, a new profile, or a new task on a drug or a therapeutic transition) is the use of a drug that has been approved for the purpose of a new treatment, i.e. for a disease or medical condition that is different from the original purpose of drug development.
It is a pathway of scientific research currently underway to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescent plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be targeted for the drug, each protein has several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of such ligand binding sites could be the basis of an effective antiviral drug development project against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A, et al examined several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed for their skeletal similarity to approved drugs and had the highest similarity to accelerate the development of potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs in their preclinical studies to be recommended in clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydrochloroquine are two of the four drugs to be studied as part of a Solidarity clinical trial.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that trials of chloroquine and hydrochloroquine in New York would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate based on Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC says that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not been established.
Doctors said they were using the drug when "there was no other option".
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting safety and efficacy trials of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claim that favipiravir proved "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminds the public that the evidence that exists to support the drug is insufficient and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan for supplies and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in cases of severe illness with a virus that has been replicating.
This medication may not be safe if used by pregnant women or people trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drug is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify a drug to find a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to reposition a drug developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in international Solidarity trials.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences discovered that Remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several phylo-, pneumo-, paramixo-, and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is the occurrence of resistance through mutations that can lead to disease and more severe transmission.
Some preliminary pre-test studies suggest remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospital, one for people with moderate illness and one for people with severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19, namely two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York began testing for antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.

For a form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, Phase II trials are ongoing with 200 patients being recruited from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently researching the role of colkisin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not use effective contraceptive methods are not eligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Drug Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients examining the use of enosaprine sodium at prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention is focused on giving new treatment objectives to antiviral drugs approved and developed for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to Chinese guidelines 7th edition
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to Chinese guidelines 7th edition
Some of the antibiotics identified potentially as drugs that could be given a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by China.
In addition, trials were also conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
b'Covid-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, many efforts are underway to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the disease, will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in a Phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world by 2020, resulting in large investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the publicized genome to develop a vaccine that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative made a statement in April that the things to look out for in developing vaccines are speed, production capacity, deployment on the required scale, as well as global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets that advance to Phase I security studies, include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vectors (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vectors)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little public information available (considered to be under planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials carried out initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations, while determining a more precise effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involved more participants, including the control group, and tested the vaccine's effectiveness to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates currently actively developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of them have not been in human evaluation (still in "praclinical" research).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they are starting to develop a vaccine, with the target of testing in humans by 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they were starting to develop the vaccine.
Janssen is working with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of vaccines with technologies similar to those used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that it had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and would begin testing.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced they are embarking on a vaccine project to create an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Supply Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were working with Novavax Inc.
in the development and development of vaccines.
Furthermore, the partnership announced plans for preclinical testing and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced they were working on 11 isolates, and even on the fast track, the development of the vaccine took at least about one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is currently in laboratory research, with human testing planned in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered “a large sum of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
Currently, the mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they will get preclinical testing results in April 2020 and vaccine candidates who are in the final stages can begin testing on humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced an investment of US<0x24>4.9 million in a consortium of COVID-19 vaccine research involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with a total investment of CEPI in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine reaching US<0x24>29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates in animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine that could amplify itself for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving a sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a fund of C<0x24>275 million for 96 medical countermeasure research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced a C<0x24>192 million fund dedicated to developing a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurred.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing of PittCoVacc, a candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine, in mice; they stated that "MNA that administered the S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine gave rise to a potent antigen specific antibody response [in mice] that began to be seen 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo's Faculty of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a heterologic effect, also called a nonspecific effect.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Further randomized trials in Australia sought to include 4,170 health workers.
It is possible that the vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-GMO rats, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, suggests the need for containment measures to achieve biological safety levels 3 in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. In addition, proven vaccines for MERS also do not exist.
As MERS becomes prevalent, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that completes phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-MERS-S vector.
Social media posts echo conspiracy theories that claim the virus behind COVID-19 has been known before and that vaccines have been available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of olfactory power, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is generally about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop viral pneumonia and compound organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads between humans during close contact, often through small splashes or droplets produced through coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
Although it is produced when exhaling, the droplet usually falls to the ground or to the surface and is not contagious to a long distance.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can survive up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms appear and after the later stages of the disease. The standard diagnosis method is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the nasopharyngeal wipe.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of contracting the virus and the person treating it.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by the general public vary; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be without symptoms or experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or congestion in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, and bluish face or lips; medical treatment is immediately recommended if these symptoms appear.
Top respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, sneezing, or sore throat, can be found, but are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China were initially only with the clinical picture of chest tightness and palpitations.
In some people, the disease can progress to pneumonia, compound organ failure, and death.
This period is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected people experience symptoms.
The role of these symptomless carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who show no symptoms is unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic during hospitalization.
China’s National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; out of 166 infections that day, 130 cases (78%) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry viral loads on a large scale.
Speaking out loud releases more sparks or droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered cough can cause droplets to be pushed up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) away.
Although the virus is usually not airborne, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission is possible and air collectors placed in hallways outside people's rooms produce positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resuscitation (RJP), can make respiratory secretions turn into aerosols and then spread through the air.
While there are concerns that the virus can spread through stools, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus can persist on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was found that the virus can be detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products decompose the protective layer of the virus fat, deactivate the virus, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidin gluconate (surgical disinfectant), were less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in the median two days after hospitalization began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in nature-related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which damages its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the first SARS-CoV.
The lung is the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cell through the angiotensin 2-changer enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in pulmonary type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike or bulge" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injuries are found in 12% of infected people who are hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe illness.
The level of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the presence of systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and are involved in heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in COVID-19 infection patients in the ICU and may be associated with a poor prognosis. Autopsies in people who died from COVID-19 found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for airway epithelial cells that express ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of monocytes that secrete IL-6 inflammation and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported on autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually done on a breathing sample obtained through a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal or sputum swab sample may also be used.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but require two blood samples taken at a distance of two weeks so that the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate the strain and publish its genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can develop independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to detect infections by these viruses.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect an active infection and if a person has been infected before) are under development, but have not been widely used.
China's experience with such testing shows its accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical picture and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distributions is widely encountered early in infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (the thickening of the lobular septum with alveolar filling varies), and consolidation can appear as the disease progresses.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings on autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and the formation of many core giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in the healing stage: arrangement of exudates in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leucoeritroblastic reactions
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Suitable hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings of fabrics in public places, in part to limit transmission by people without symptoms. Social restriction strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with many people, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large-scale meetings in public places.
Restriction guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
Since vaccines are anticipated to not exist until early 2021, the main part in dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic’s peak, known as “aligning the curve”.
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after getting out of the toilet or when their hands look dirty, before eating, as well as after going through the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Further the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends people who suspect they are carrying the virus to wear a simple face mask.
Extraorporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure problems, but the benefits are still being considered.
Self-hygiene and lifestyle and a healthy diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive care may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for dealing with hospitalized COVID-19 sufferers.
Intensive care experts and lung experts in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health workers caring for COVID-19 sufferers, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Tular-Air Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (APD) during a pandemic.
Recommended equipment are: APD robes, respirators or face masks, eye protection, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (not face masks) are better.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial order, but the FDA has authorised these masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
N95 respirators are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified use on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face protection or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe as to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some cases are indeed severe.
This type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively researched for people hospitalized, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal cannula or bipositive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether either of these methods yields the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Heavy cases are more common in the elderly (people over 60 years of age, and especially people over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of health systems to deal with sudden spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% of intensive care units entered, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 sufferers eventually enter the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
A ventilator capable of performing high pressure control and PEEP modes is needed to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pulmonary and pneumothorax-related ventilator injuries.
High PEEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take until 2021, some of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried in people with severe illness.
The WHO recommended volunteers participated in trials of effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in the case of a person’s life being severely or immediately endangered.
Plasma convalescent has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove its safety and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'close contacts' using surveillance data so as to detect potential risks of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also notifies local health workers. Mahadata analytics on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people they contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track cell phone data of people suspected of contracting the coronavirus.
The move was taken to impose quarantine and protect people who might be in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed aggregate phone location data to the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italy’s regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told mobile operators that “40% of residents are still moving around”.
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People can experience stress from quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic decline are perfect storms that endanger people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can last mildly with little or no symptoms, which resembles other common upper respiratory tract diseases, such as a cold.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but the data for COVID-19 is still lacking. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and lead to pneumonia.
In people most severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or compound organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clot abnormalities, particularly increased prothrombin time, were observed in 6% of COVID-19 patients hospitalized, while kidney function abnormalities were seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 picture show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospitalization.
However, patients who were transferred to the ICU had a seven-day median time between hospitalization and death.
In a study that examined early cases, the median time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudate in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes are observed in pneumocytes.
The pulmonary image resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was observed, with increased troponin levels or cardiac stoppage.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people hospitalized have congenital conditions. The availability of medical and socioeconomic resources of an area can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to differences in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Lack of mild case counting can cause the mortality rate to be calculated too high.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases that took place in the past can mean that the current mortality rate is calculated too low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die compared to nonsmokers. There are concerns about the long-term sequel of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and a pulmonary scan showed organ damage.
It can also cause post-treatment-intensive syndrome after healing.
As of March 2020, it is not known if previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity to people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible, if viewed as another coronavirus behavior, but there have been reported cases of COVID-19 cured followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
The case is believed to be a worsening residual infection, and not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and of animal origin, through a spread infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infections is almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the date of the onset of the earliest symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, as well as are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, handling options, the time since the first outbreak, and the character of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for clinically diagnosed or epidemiological COVID-19 deaths without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infections. The death to case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the mortality to case ratio globally is 6.9% (153,822/2,240.191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measurements include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die from certain diseases, and the infectious fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from certain diseases.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population ranging from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 residents, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through the Carnival festival, which spreads to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and possibly not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) configured died of COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rates are different for both men and women.
Mortality was higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the risk difference between new men and women not appearing at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for this gender-based distinction is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on gender, a lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of people infected are men and 72% of people who die from COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track gender-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of female health workers, particularly nurses, is higher, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), an animal species, or a group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that caused COVID-19 was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses the "Covid-19 virus" and the "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronaviruses".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, these viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "cronaviruses" and "cronaviruses of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCov acute respiratory diseases as temporary names for viruses and diseases in accordance with the 2015 guidelines that urge not to use location names in the name of diseases and viruses.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital desperately needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier could not deliver in the required time scale, a local company engineered-back and printed the 100 required valves overnight.
After the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation emerged regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread quickly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved medications or vaccines to treat the disease.
International research into COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "Solidarity Trial" to examine the treatment effect of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First, researchers aim to make the virus vaccine intact.
The use of the virus, either inactive or dead, aims to quickly trigger the human body’s immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to specific subunits in viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on the S-spike protein that helped the virus infiltrate the enzyme receptor ACE2.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique for making vaccinations).
Experimental vaccines made with these strategies should be tested to find out their safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic codes copied from viruses that cause disease. An antibody-dependent increase has been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway in April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The new-purpose antiviral drug formed most of China's research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in some countries with a reporting deadline in late April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates already exists. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which includes remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is temporary evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there is a call for a peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, despite recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that a double dose is extremely dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 sufferers.The 7th edition of Chinese guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Initial data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations.Research shows that early priming of bulging proteins by transmembrane protease serin 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have great limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of cytokine storms can occur in advanced severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anticytokine properties. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study is completed.
The drug is undergoing a phase 2 non-random test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to fight cytokine storms, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, namely CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no randomised and controlled evidence suggesting that tocilizumab is a potent treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being studied as a nonvaccinated passive immunization method.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a mechanism of action that is expected for passive antibody therapy to mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that depend on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Another form of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced, is in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which is a liquid part of a patient’s blood that is cured and contains antibodies specific to the virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
