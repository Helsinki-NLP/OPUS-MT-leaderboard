The City Council of Wales (AM) is concerned about "looking like a doll"
There was concern among some AMs over the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of Parliament of Wales).
It emerged due to a plan to change the name of the conference to the Welsh Parliament.
I'm worried that the entire political spectrum will be able to attract scorn.
An AM of the Labour Party said his party cared “he rhymes with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.”
For readers outside of Wales: In Wales, ‘twp' means ‘crazy' and ‘pwp' means ‘unclean.'
AM of Plaid said his party as a whole was "unhappy" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was ‘open-minded’ about the name change, but stated it was a brief oral leap from the MWP to the Dolls.
In this context, the Welsh letter ‘w’ is referred to as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter ‘u.’
The Council Commission, which is drafting a law to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision on any government referred to as a Member must be a matter for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 authorizes the Welsh council to change its name.
In June, the Commission notified the results of public negotiations on a proposal that had wide support for calling the council as the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the AM title, the Commission favors the Members of Parliament of Wales or the WMP, but the MWP option receives the most support in public consultation.
AM seems to be proposing alternative options, but it is problematic to reach a consensus and could jeopardize Honorary Chief Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within weeks.
Laws on reform include other changes to the way the council works, including regulations on AM disqualification and the design of committee systems.
I will have a final vote on what to say when they discuss the law.
Macedonia votes in referendum on country name change
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country’s name to the ‘North Republic of Macedonia.’
The popular vote was set up in an effort to resolve decades of disagreements with neighboring Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its offer of membership to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was just a price to pay to join the EU and NATO unions.
St. Martin's Bell Silent as Churches Strike in Harlem
“The parents I met said, historically, there are bars and churches in every street corner,” Adams said.
"They're both gone today."
He said the loss of the bar was understandable.
"People are socializing in different ways nowadays," he said.
"The bar is no longer a living room in the neighborhood where people will always go."
For the church, he feared money from the sale of assets would not last as long as leaders expected it, "and sooner or later they would return where they started."
Churches, he said, could be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums inhabited by people who do not want to help maintain the shrine that remains in the neighbourhood.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white," he said, "and therefore will have these churches closed altogether because it is unlikely that most people who enter these condominiums will be members of the churches."
Both churches were built by whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist church moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black church had taken possession of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the blacks under the Honourable John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants at 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which opposed the recruitment or promotion of blacks in employment.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Pastor Johnson made plans to rebuild, they ordered the tower bell.
David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the tower bell a ‘poor folk bell.’
Experts who played the carillon in July called it something else: ‘Cultural treasures’ and ‘historical instruments that cannot be replaced.’
Expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played in St Martin over the past few months has been a hassle to architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by church leaders, others by Episcopal bishops.
The vestry space - the congregation's administrative body, consisting of civil leaders - wrote in July with concern that the bishop "will seek to approve costs" for the vestry space, even if the vestry space is not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors brought in by the bishop.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the bishop's part.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy while diving in search of a coral shrimp in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving in search of coral shrimp in California on the opening day of the reef season, officials said.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing along with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a fun scream catching a crab, but he "saw the boy screaming, 'I have to bite!
I've got to bite!"
His entire collarbone had been torn and opened," Hammel said he noticed when he got the boy.
"I screamed to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The child was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of sharks responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that sharks had been found in the area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed to be a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed off beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles says there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams from a beauty-style room in a department store run by expert assistants.
As part of the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion effort to enter the beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow as fashion and home appliances sales return, a larger beauty space will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and taken to more stores next year if it turns out to be a success.
Investment in beauty comes as supermarkets look for ways to use the previously claimed shelf space for TVs, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the size of its beauty deals to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the same branded parts as those found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket has also relaunched a range of Boutique makeup products so that the majority of its products are vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly in demand by buyers from young people.
Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first of which opened in Croydon, south of London, last week while the second one opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and moving towards buying a little bit of food every day at a local convenience store means the supermarket has to work hard again to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said the branch would look like a convenience store as the supermarket chain tries to fight the big business of Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury puts Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several venues since it bought both chains two years ago, said to have increased retail sales and made turnover more profitable.
The supermarket had previously wanted to modify the parts of beauty and pharmacy that ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boot in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after arguing about how to divide income from pharmacies in its supermarket.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a role in the show, adding a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and appearance in our beauty space to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest with friends who are specially trained to be willing to offer advice.
Our range of brands are designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and comfortable location means that we are now a fascinating beauty destination challenging the old fashioned way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'beater' after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 million offer
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons' Den, after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for home items and accessories from the True Brand.
The couple's business was likened to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The presenter This Morning, 37, used Instagram to announce that he would quit.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones in a rage by pulling out of the lucrative lifestyle brand's business at the last minute - to focus on her new extraordinary contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was “a beaver” when the successful TV woman admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — meant she had no time to devote home items and accessories from the True brand.
The business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation homes.
The source said: "Over the years, Holly has really been a priority.
It will be his long-term future that will see him through the next few decades.
The decision to pull out everyone involved was truly shocking.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launching.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of the presenter This Morning, which is among the most acceptable stars in the bank in Britain, could cost firms millions of dollars due to large investments in products ranging from cushioning and candles to clothing and household goods, and potentially delaying its launch.
It could be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children and husband Dan Baldwin has been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truely with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin, a TV publishing firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M<0x26>S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's lawyer on the I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business dealings."
It's a tough conversation, and then we fall in love."
He joked about criticism that would be received by the news media for making reviews that some would consider “improper to the president” and very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a voice-over of ‘news readers.’
“I never gave up.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June had been crowned by Trump as a major step towards the cessation of North Korea's nuclear program.
But talks about the cessation of the nuclear program have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "similar response" from the United States about North Korea's initial ceasefire.
On the contrary, he said, the U.S. continued the sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
“We are going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results - ending rocket testing, helping to free hostages, and bringing back the bodies of American soldiers back home.
And he defended his extraordinary approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but rather than having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this dense arena, we're going to have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him directly.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Islands, Killing Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been evacuated, no national disaster has been declared, as a condition to cater for international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they clearly did not ask for international help, so it was quite challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children together in a team goes to Palu, it is uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the scene.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Based on the earthquake that Indonesia often faces, the country remains unprepared for natural disasters.
Although a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastal beaches.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning has come into effect, is like contributing to the loss of life.
At the best of times, traveling between the islands of Indonesia is indeed challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the quake was heading to Palu, but it took at least three days to get to the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made poor infrastructure improvements a key factor in his election campaign, and he has given high allocation to roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has hit the Jokowi administration as he faces re-election next year.
Jokowi faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have accepted a more conservative religious understanding.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge equalises against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring one goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal with his team leading 1-0.
He kicked the ball to the left before kicking towards a distant goal net.
The attempt soared high above the goal goal as it drifted towards the top right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball fell over Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always carry the ball as far away as possible, so I'm trying to spend as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and make a kick and don't think long and make a shot on it."
Chelsea went 1-0 in the semi-finals after receiving a 25th-minute net from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before jumping in the middle of the pitch and running into the centre of Liverpool.
Kovacic gives and transmits can be quickly in the middle.
He then unleashed a beautiful kick, bringing Hazard into the goal.
Danger passed the defence and netted away with a left-footed kick past Liverpool player Alisson Becke.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said earlier on Sunday.
Many people were reportedly trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building in a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck Friday and triggered a 20-foot wave, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which had more than 380,000 people, was filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation was carried out after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55am with a stabbing at Grayson Mews on John Street, with the 32-year-old arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages but I appeal to anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially the taxi driver, who may have recorded something on the dashboard camera Futej to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokeswoman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local Birkenhead and she was found inside her home.
In the evening, friends who believed they knew the woman had arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police said an investigation is underway, they are in the process of informing the victim's heirs.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to break into his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was stunned when he found out what was going on.
Residents were told the investigation took hours until they were allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
He kept repeating "it's so horrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and one outside.
Several officers were standing inside the cordon monitoring the block of flat apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing 247 logs from 30 September.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament is the latest memorial to be hit by 'history of rewriting'
His removal would be a poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban with so much of the artifact culture and religion of England perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as 'stupid' and 'trying to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in today's debate about the removal of the statues to which Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English civil war was neither directed nor run by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for Thomas's ancestral actions in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful representation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century and part of the history of the figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded by many, more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his situation of course the monarchy.
Whether it is a full representation becomes the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped our country's next development, and Cromwell is an individual known as a figure representing a divided part.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be celebrated and commemorated."
Pigs Separate Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery, filled with blood near a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and found a pig door open.
He said in a pig's cage was a large male pig with his mouth bleeding.
Forensic examinations confirm that a 550-pound pig has beaten farmers to death, according to the report.
"His family" Wu," said, as quoted by the Evening News Guiyang.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the store at 4.40am Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Night News that pigs had been locked to prevent him from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly making compensation negotiations for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove him away.
After Oregon farmers were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not always aggressive but a sense of blood could act as a "trigger."
They're just kidding.
They're nippers, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to pay the right amount of respect," he said.
Excess Typhoon Rosa brings extensive heavy rains to southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Typhoon Rosa is weakening as it moves into the cold waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains in northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. on the next day.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, Category Storm 1, until 5 a.m. East Sunday time, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trench that began to form in the Pacific Ocean and moved eastwards towards the U.S. West Coast When Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she began to resist the tropics north-southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity interacts with approaching troughs that create heavy rains in the Southwest the next day.
Within the country, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, flows of debris and landslides likely in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwestern part, especially more from Arizona.
Lightning flooding may be in severe conditions due to the distribution of tropical rain.
It is highly recommended to plunge into the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to creek and thunderstorms that will bring country strong winds and dust blowing.
The approaching trough will bring heavy rainfall on the southern coast of California.
Rainfall amounts of more than half an inch may occur, which can lead to the flow of small debris and slippery streets.
This is the first rainfall in the region during the dry season.
Some of the tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become further late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
In October you can see some intense temperature changes crossing the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain a little warmer.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes with short-range temperatures.
There was a great example of a temperature difference through the U.S. center on Sunday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat of the summer will linger to try to build and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to see a warm start to October with the 80s extending from the South Plains to the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which estimates 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people witnessed shocking testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of being sexually assaulted allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute touch: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was groping him and trying to take off his shirt at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his testimony, said 100 per cent would not have happened.
It was probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company calculates the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers are not immediately available for other networks that show PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a problem measuring people watching in the office.
To put it in perspective, the audience size is the same as a football game or an Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, which believes the hosts have supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers while listening throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The benefits remain high after listening.
Flake is the main character in this Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested as a CNN and CBS camera on Friday morning screamed by protesters as he tried to board the elevator to the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with a disabled eye for a few minutes when he preached, live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," one woman said.
"You think he's telling the truth?"
He was told, "You have power when many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, he would say a lot at the committee's hearing.
The cable network and broadcasts all covered hours live later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would see charges against the nominee next week, a minority democrat urged.
Flake is confident of part of the conversation with his friend, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice does have power, as it is clear Republicans will not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political play" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and jeopardizing the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the newspaper’s front page, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack said to be Checkers for Brexit, saying Britain and the EU’s proposals should collect tariffs on each other “completely absurd.”
Wayde Sims shooter: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson suspect with LSU player's death
Police have arrested the suspect in shooting dead Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was detained and placed in prison on two-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost glasses during the fight.
Police recovered glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted Wayde had been physically shot dead.
His bond has been set at <0x24>350,000, the Attorney-General reports.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's office issued a report early Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department credits Louisiana State Police's hunting team, state police crime labs, Southern University Police and local residents to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for "persistence and justice efforts".
Sims is 20 years old.
6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
Dust spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano to the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and dust over a 24-hour period.
The center monitors various earthquakes and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of car windshield covered with ash in residential areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists are aware of an increase in activity on the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan supporters on the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands participated in demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing election of secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by riot police hurled them with eggs and released paint powder, leaving a dark cloud on the streets frequented by tourists.
The fight also took place later with the police using their sticks to fight.
Hours later, pro-independence groups chanted "Not to be forgotten, no pardons" facing unionist protesters shouting, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region's independence a year after the October 1 vote was deemed illegal by Madrid but welcomed by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for independence, although the percentage of voter turnout was low with those opposed to secession largely boycotting the vote.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop polling at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday to prevent demonstrations supporting the country's police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer hoped for Catalonia's prospects of independence.
“Last year we went through one of our best moments of life.
"I saw my parents cry so happy to be able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
While management is important if it comes close to victory in regional elections in December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain the momentum this year with its many prominent leaders either in exile or in custody to await trial for their role in arranging referendums and declarations of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded protests against police support on her phone, saying the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before trial since the end of last year, announced he would run for European Parliament next year.
"Competing as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in the democratic values and oppression we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man detained after house hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the same car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the door and the building itself.
A crossover may have also opened fire on the car at some point.
The attack gave Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston earned the win
Livingston's rise surprised the Rangers to hand Steven Gerrard to a second defeat in 18 games as club manager Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's attack proved different when Gary Holt's team moved with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side remain winless in the Premiership this season and face the Hearts chief, who they will track with eight points on Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended the unbeaten run in this section to six matches, with head coach Holt still feeling a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed the chance against the opposition.
Holt's team should have been a long way ahead before scoring, with their involvement causing the Rangers to face all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his effort past the goal, but Alan Lithgow was only able to give up his effort after sliding into Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts are eager to let the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they can cause problems to the opposing side with a set cut.
And that’s the way in which important goals are there.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston opened the curtain, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set Menga, who took a touch and a goal network from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had mastered possession but had found a home defense that could not penetrate and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely okay.
The pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's rescue.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored from another Livingston match.
Crosses went straight into Livingston's box and kept clearing, while two penalty claims - after the challenge of Halkett's replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - bounced away.
'Fenomena' of Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
For men, they are very brilliant, continuing to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since returning to the top level, but big credits have had to go to Holt for him to launch the team since he came.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett is very brave, creating an orderly great defense, while keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over the toes.
Rangers are less inspiring, though.
Good as they are sometimes under Gerrard, they fall far from that standard.
The last ball was rather deficient - only once they cut the host team - and it was a call for the Rangers to wake up, who found themselves at the midtable.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has received a number of receptions in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They talked about issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's participation in the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
It is the largest Turkish home outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a strong crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many nearby supporters wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
War protests portray the happiness of a visitor who is hailed as a hero by some Turks and fired as an autocrat by others.
Deptford Road Accident: Bicyclists Killed in Car Collision
A cyclist dies in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The incident came months after another cyclist died in a crash on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were trying to identify the man and inform his heirs.
Road closures and bus detours in places and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Jail: Six Officers Injured in Disarmament
Six prison officials were injured in disturbances in a man's high-security prison, the Prison Office said.
The disruption occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
The "Tornado" Specialist Officer was brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involved eight inmates and had one wing.
Officers have been treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "Trained prison personnel have been assigned to deal with the ongoing events at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and obviously they are responsible for referring to the police and can spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 detainees, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officials were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Lightning Floods (Drought Areas Benefit)
It's rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rosa's wind energy tracks cross the Southwest Desert, a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for Arizona west to south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a route over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late last night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted only "ten tropical tornadoes remain stormy or depressive status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the Southwest Desert including the center of the Rockies and the Great Basin will probably get 1 to 2 inches, with a remote amount of up to maybe 4 inches.
For them from the risk of flash flooding, the rains of Rosa may have been a blessing since the region was hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some of the rainfall will be beneficial since the Southwest is currently experiencing a drought state.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona experienced the worst drought, the second-highest category, "reported by weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, having a typhoon power Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm faces cold waters in the Pacific and therefore generates a drop.
As such, it is expected to landslide in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm in the evening or evening on Monday.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico can be heavy, leading to the risk of major flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, up to maybe 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Rosa will track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then will track through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main hazard expected from Rosa or debris is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to produce life-threatening flash floods and debris streams in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four arrests of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested yesterday in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
The officer appealed to those who might have cell phone recordings of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'suffered, meaningless, angry' Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics in the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered terrible, angry" Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, decisively and emotionally denying allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted during the decade during her teenage years.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday "the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"One vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds at the moment, a jurist who has an outstanding record in the public service," he told the crowd who supported West Virginia.
The president simultaneously referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of Republican elections in general elections.
"Five more weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn’t run, but I really ran,” he said.
"That's why I'm in a place that's fighting for great candidates."
Trump argues that Democrats are on a mission to "oppose and deter."
The vote for the first major procedure in the Senate on Kavanaugh's naming is expected to take place no later than Friday, the GOP's senior aide leadership has told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake, tsunami, with tolls rising
At least 384 people were killed, many swept by giant waves that crashed off the coast, as a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18 ft) high wave crashed on land at dusk, sweeping many deaths and destroying anything on their way.
Tsunami followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach and not running and eventually they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster capture agency BNPB, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged the car, logs, home, it attacked everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) prior to the shooting on the edge.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and were safe, he said.
About 16,700 people have been transferred to 24 centres in Paluu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops being destroyed, bridges turning and collapsing and a mosque surrounded by water.
The storm continued to shake the city by the beach on Saturday.
Some of the aftershocks were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Research and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city, located at the end of the long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami wave, the agency said.
Nugroho described the destruction as "widening" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building and said another 540 were injured and 29 people were still missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and destruction may be even more catastrophic along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala. It is close to the epicenter.
"The communications were completely cut off without any information from Donggala," Nugroho said.
"About 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy but it could be even worse," the Red Cross said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had hit Palu despite officials saying that the tsunami occurred during the warning period.
In an amateur video circulating on social media, the voice of a man on the building screamed at the crowd on the street about the presence of the tsunami.
Within minutes, the tsunami waves hit the beach and pulled together buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the video footage.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a massive power leak that cut off communications around Palu and this made it difficult for authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military has sent aid with cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but many people still need food and other basic necessities, authorities said.
The city's airport has been reopened for aid efforts only and it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800.
It's so bad.
When the World Vision Staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, they went through the scene of the disaster. Workers took refuge under tarpaulins erected in the front yard of their offices in Palu, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of homes destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Although relief teams began to provide disaster relief in a bleak setting, some say foreign aid workers with deep experience were prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies of material needs and shipments of workers from abroad can only be carried out if the disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
That still doesn't happen.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross Force.
"When the government says "OK, this is a national disaster," then we can receive help from abroad but for now there is no status."
When the second night came in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the surviving victims wished their loved ones to be a miracle that appeared and cheered them from their grief.
On Saturday, a child was found in a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue teams rescued the woman who was trapped under a stone rubble for two days with her mother's body lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian parasite team, has trained two parasitists who were lost in the quake for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped at Hotel Roa Roa were his students, Mr Mandagi said.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told of how he was willing to send a WhatsApp message to the launchers in Palu who participated in the beach festival after hours of news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the parasite community.
The message sent has only one gray-colored tag instead of two blue-colored ones.
"I don't think the message came," he said.
Thieves steal <0x24>26,750 while charging ATM money in Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole <0x24>26,750 from Brink workers who filled the money at Newport on the Levee ATM on Friday, according to news released by the Newport Police Department.
The Brink worker emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was ready to send more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink’s workers are busy doing their job, a man ‘runs to his back’ and steals a bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene based on the report, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the thief should call Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rap singer changed her name to Ye
Rap singer Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the change in his name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "This man is officially known as Kanye West."
Kanye West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a while and he used the nickname as the title of his eighth album which was released in June.
The conversion took place during his appearance on the Saturday Night Live show where he is expected to release his latest album Yandhi.
"She replaced singer Ariana Grande who cancelled her appearance on the show over 'emotional issues,'" the show's creator said.
Previously, Kanye West said the name had religious significance and was also an abbreviation for his current professional name.
“I believe ‘yes’ is a common word found in the Bible and it means ‘you’,” Kanye West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with the Big Boy radio host.
"So I'm you too. I'm us too. We're us.
It turns from Kanye which means only one, to Ye - an image of a reflection of our good, our bad and our confusion and everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our own true image."
He was one of the most famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year he announced that he would prefer the name Love and Brother Love.
Kanye West's former co-worker JAY-Z can also accept it without or with streak marks and capital letters.
Mexican President Amlo has vowed not to use military action against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to take military action against civilians as the country nears its 50th anniversary of a bloody tragedy against students.
AMLO pledged at Plaza Tlatelolco on Saturday to "never use the army to curb Mexicans."
On October 2, 1968, the military opened fire on civilians who protested peacefully in the square, killing 300 civilians as leftist students began to march across Latin America.
AMLO vowed to support Mexico's youth by subsidizing monthly students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted young people to get involved in criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its artificial intelligence fund
"The United States should double the amount of funding in the field of artificial intelligence as China becomes increasingly active in that field," said Kai-Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence investor and practitioner who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view comes after the U.S. government made an announcement about artificial intelligence even though the U.S. itself as a whole lacks an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year with the aim of becoming the number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Doubting the allocation of artificial intelligence studies is a good start as all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to have the next success in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"Doubting the funds could increase the chances of the next major achievement of artificial intelligence in the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee’s book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that had defeated American Othello's best-placed player while still studying at Carnegie Mellon University. Later, he became an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robot Challenge from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and wanted to know when the next competition would be held so that he could identify new talents.
"Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to win government aid," Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking on academic leaders but corporate companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have appointed great talents from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said a change in immigration policy could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhD graduates in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China released the Future Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
“China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions. It equates to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations divide funds into US researchers but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center aimed at gathering partners from industry and academies. The White House announced a line of Select Committees for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of <0x24>2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF invests more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. bill attempting to establish the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence appears to have been out of action for several months.
Macedonians voted to change the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday to determine the name change to the ‘North Macedonian Republic’. A move that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia, insists that the name ‘Macedonia’ represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed it to reject Macedonia’s participation in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on a proposed name change in June, but nationalist opposition said the change undermined the ethnic identity of Macedonians whose majority are Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the polls and the nomination raised doubts as to whether the ballot would reach the minimum of 50 per cent of the vote needed to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper read: "Do you agree to join NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said: "The acceptance of the new name is a price well worth paying to join the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union because that means our lives are safer," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Despite being unlawful, members of parliament said they would abide by the voting decision to make it final.
The name change requires two-thirds of the majority in parliament.
The country's electoral commission said there were no reports of things that were not in accordance with the rules until 1 p.m.
However, the voting attendance was 16 per cent against 34 per cent in parliamentary elections in 2016 after 66 per cent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children. Our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko cast a ballot in Macedonia for the country's name change that will pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is erecting a small stage and placing seats in front of tents erected by those who boycotted the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to join it with pride rather than this way," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor people, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO's participation would provide ample investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is above 20 percent.
I believe a large majority will accept because more than 80 per cent of our population voted for the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said the ‘yes’ decision was ‘confirmation of our future.’
A vote was published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Review which said between 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the poll - below the required amount.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telma, found that as many as 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a vote, the number of voters who voted must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
Failure to vote will be considered the first serious blow to pro-Western government police since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton's entire defensive line-up to get a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent off as Brighton defenders at Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look very happy on his network in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He raced between Brighton's three defences, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He turned down a defender before chasing a few more men at the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he turned to the left, looking for the sterling.
The forward used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by one kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with a foot problem," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in a Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a deep ball in the Brighton area during the match.
He made a beautiful pass through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling to a distant position.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net before sliding out of bounds.
City against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group play at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies.
With the Nationals being eliminated from the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hopes to face the fort on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are running out play implication for the Rockies, who hold one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies embraced at least a special opportunity spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock in their first division champions.
"Even if we're just playing, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams will play maybe at the highest level I'm going to play this year.
Why don't I want to fight in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to make a throw in this situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, held a warm-up session on Thursday and will make a throw on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The batter that used the right hand from Washington was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 precise punches in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
The president with no direct reference to the situation surrounding the High Court voted for Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the number of Republicans coming in midterm elections.
"Everything we have done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to face the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not competing but I'm very competitive and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for a great candidate," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible radical Democrat group, you see it's happening right now.
And they're desperate to regain power by using whatever method, you see cruelty, crime.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to break to gain power and power. Whatever they want to have power and control, we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to ‘reject and stop.’
"And you've seen that for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats 'anger, evil and untrue.'
She refers to the Justice Committee's senator position Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who has received a strong boo from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I'm waiting for one - it's really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Workers are no longer large churches.
They are not tolerant of anyone who expresses their views.
When activists Momentum in my local party voted to condemn me, it didn't surprise me.
After all, I'm the latest in the AP Labor lineup to be told that we're not welcome - all because of voiced our views
My parliamentary friend Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because she supported anti-Jewish.
In my case, the criticism movement has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interest of responsibility about economic policy, about national security, about Europe, whose ironic issue is almost the same as what Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The meeting notice for the Labor party Nottingham East on Friday said that "we want an all-inclusive and productive meeting."
For almost eight years as a local Labour AP, the GC meeting on Friday night completely covered all of that.
Sadly today, it is not the tone for many meetings and the political promise of ‘better, softer’ has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever started.
It is becoming more evident that differences in views are unacceptable in the Labour party and each opinion will be judged whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as a colleague who had previously, I think sharing almost the same political views began to expect me to make a U-turn and take a position that I would not agree with - either on the basis of national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak outside - and it doesn't matter what I say - then it will be followed by criticism for abuse on social media, being told not to vote, denouncing the political center, getting me out of the Labour party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I'm more fortunate than my colleagues for commenting on me more on politics.
I was impressed by the professional attitude and persistence of my colleagues who were showered with vows of sexism and racism every day but never gave up.
One aspect of the political disappointment of this era is how the rate of abuse has become accustomed.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour party foster cultural tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a vast church and with every ‘disbelief’ motion or change in electoral rules, the party is becoming narrower.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the last two years urging me to keep quiet, not to stand out too much and then I’ll ‘be good.’
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since I joined Labor 32 years ago as a school student, raised by the Thatcher government's abandonment that left my entire classroom shattered, I've been trying to lead better public services for those most in need - either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East may be confused about my position and the part of the conflict with the current leadership.
To those who support the motion on Friday, what I want to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it will stifle our households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the feeling of wasting my time and energy on my loyalty to Labour leaders.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, whether or not it is Labour members: I am proud to serve you and I promise that the threat of not being elected or political suitability does not prevent me from acting in what I believe is in your interest.
Chris Leslie is an AP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The unrivalled Ayr climbs to the top
Two slow attempts may have made the final decision to travel, but there's no doubt Ayr deserved success in this exciting and entertaining Premiership Tennent match.
They are now in the top spot on the table, the only one that has never lost out of 10 people.
Finally, their superior defense, as much as they took the opportunity, made the home team and coach Peter Murchie feel happy.
"We have been tested on our game so far, and we are still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thanks to Ayr, they took a better chance than us."
Grant Anderson made an attempt in the 14th minute, a conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, was issued for the match by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make the net and Jason Baggot caught a non-conversion attempt.
Climo led Ayr on penalties, before, at half-time, he earned points later on a solo conversion attempt to make 17-5 to Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started the second time well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, the conversion by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was brought out, and from the start, Ayr went straight forward again through Stafford McDowall's attempt, a conversion by Climo.
Substitute captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose countered the extra player with a non-conversion attempt of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a time of intense pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card due to the Climo tackle without the ball, from the outside of the penalty line, MacPherson broke in behind hit Ayr's forward.
Climo's conversion, as he did almost like a restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent away flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth try.
Still Game stars are seen to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is set to move into the hospitality industry after he was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's famous show, where he writes and stars along with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to official records reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to engage in a “progressive restaurant business.”
'The ocean is ours': Bolivia surrounded by land hopes court will reopen path to the Pacific
The Marine Corps is headquartered in La Paz.
The public building flew a blue sea flag.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is engraved with the motto: 'The ocean is our real property.
Getting it back is a responsibility."
Throughout mainland Bolivia, the memory of losing its coast to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still clear - like a yearning to surf the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps the highest in the century, as Bolivia is still awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of talks.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of solidarity and calm, and certainly hopes for a positive decision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will favor Bolivia's claim - after centuries of talks - that Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign exit into the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic original president - who faces a controversial fixture for next year's re-election - was also heavily involved in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision in favour of Bolivia - and if it happens a little bit very much will change.
The U.N. body based in the Netherlands has no authority to grant the territory to Chile, and has determined that it will not determine a decision for possible discussions.
On the ICJ's decision to come out only after six months of final arguments were heard indicates the case was "uncomplicated," said Paz Zárate, Chile's international legal expert.
And not to slow down Bolivia's policies anymore, for the past four years there may be obstacles.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the Bolivian administration now," Zárate said.
Morales' rhetorical hostility has diminished Chile's little compassion, he suggests.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to hold talks afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that court decisions are usually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end a 139-year feud for the common good," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - used maritime issues as political aid.
"Bolivia has never given up on its right to have a direct route to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we have to forget the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons strike will not happen unless it trusts the United States
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would not do its nuclear war if it did not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be looking to restart nuclear diplomacy that stalled more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was “only a dream” that continued U.S. sanctions and opposition to the declaration of ending the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to a declaration without Pyongyang making an important act of disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are widespread doubts that Pyongyang is serious about launching a weapon that is seen as the only way to guarantee its country's security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for preparations for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show introduces the latest designs of great headdresses on its way to the main street near you.
If you want to add to your collection of hats or block the sunshine completely, then there is no need to look far.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a variety of odd-sized headdresses for their SS19 collection on the stage of a show that embellished the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
The impractical hat has swept through Instagram this summer and the designers have sent their embellishing designs to the show's stage.
The outstanding design by Valentino is a great beige-coloured hat decorated with thick artificial feathers that wide cover the model's head.
Other large-sized accessories include gem-decorated pottery, smart hats and even pineapples - but they're not designed to keep your head hot.
Thom Browne also reveals a strange choice of masks - and the perfect time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have been sewn on her lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter of a graceful outfit.
One design resembles scuba diving equipment equipped with snorkels and gogals, while the other looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep up with the big fashion statement - you're lucky.
The style observer predicts that a very large bonnet may be heading to the main road near you.
The large, warm-sized hat of 'La Bomb', a full two-foot-wide straw hat has been seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The king of labels on the back of the very impractical hat has posted on social media sending another big design to the show stage - a straw beach bag almost as big as the model covered in a bathing suit he wore.
The rafia bag is a burning orange, decorated with a edged rafia and coupled with a white handle, which stands out in the collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity style expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and beach bags arrive on the main road for the coming summer - because designers have made a huge impact and it's hard to let demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish private schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by the Scottish Board of Private Schools (SCIS), strives to serve at the best level to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students to pursue higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as global citizens.
As the education sector can they and implement an earlier school curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be well-known and subjects of choice required within the school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it will enter his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we can see that language is the top subject in the league table with the highest graduation rates in private schools.
68% of students who learn a foreign language get a higher A grade.
This data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, showed 72 percent of students got higher A grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent learning Spanish also got A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now, as subjects of choice, are being held just as they are subjects of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Occupational and Skills Commission found the reasons employers struggled to fill the vacancy, 17 percent linked to a lack of language skills.
Because of this, language skills are a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective employment opportunities requiring language, these skills are essential in this globalized world.
Regardless of one's career choice, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future by having lifelong skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country will put someone who masters many languages automatically ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough for a conversation, with French as a conversational language spoken only by two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially countries developing their economies, will equip children with better opportunities in finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the language they learn.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that the UK sees as crucial when looking ahead in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there are often many languages to choose from within a private school - as if, with an instructor specializing in that section.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing a learning atmosphere that will prepare children and provide them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is undeniable at this time, in the global business environment, that language continues to be very important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as ‘international communication skills.’
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il fait bien le juste.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools
LeBron will make his first Lakers appearance on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game before the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play hasn't been determined yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James might be playing in a limited minute.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers season.
"I don't need a game before the season to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
During Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump began a hasty rally campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump gatherings scheduled for next week, including a stop at friendly venues including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the verification vote being held for him to vote to fill the vacancy in the Federal Court, Trump aims to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's rally at Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET on this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address a trial this week for Federal Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been strained over prosecution of sexual misconduct with the confirmation of a Senate vote expected to be held for a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main target of this hasty rally is to help Republicans gain momentum in the face of the November election.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said five rallying in the coming week would be "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many of our inner states as possible towards a busy campaign season," Trump's unnamed campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percent of points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is following him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. troops show courage to fight in ensuring hope is still on the way to a singles match on Sunday
After three side-by-side fixtures, a corner match on Saturday afternoon is probably what the Ryder Cup needs this time around.
"Swinging momentum is a concept of sport that is an invention but it is really trusted by the player, and even more so in competitions like this.
Where is the momentum now?
"They have a six-point advantage and now it's four points, so we brought a bit of momentum, I think," said Jordan Spieth as he walked at the end of the day.
Europe certainly has an advantage, four points ahead with twelve more points to take.
American players, as Spieth says, feel they have a slight advantage and a sense of being driven, not just from Spieth and Justin Thomas who play together all day and each have three out of four points.
Spieth exhibits a venomous game from the start to the green area and becomes an example to other players.
The lively cheers grew louder as he continued to advance, making a crucial swipe to match the four points when he and Thomas were left behind after two points.
His swipe shot that gave them the victory on the 15th hole was greeted with the same cheer, which tells you that he believes the American team is still fighting.
"You just have to work harder and worry about your own games," Spieth said.
That’s all there is for all these players now.
18 holes to show power.
The only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the story of the undisputed Ryder Cup.
The pair of players are different characters from Europe but love four points from four and don't seem to make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to do bogi on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided bogi on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
The duration and the way their energy is given and shown by supporters is proof they are players to beat on Sunday, and no player is more popular to block the possibility of a European victory at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best that both of them are in different holes.
However, the conversation about the European team's victory was too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson facilitated the work of Sergio Garcia, the four-player hero this morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogi and two doubles in the first nine holes made it difficult for the Spaniard and the Swede.
However, on Sunday, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch more closely because of the interaction between the pair, the advice given and not given and the strategies that can change overnight.
Europe have played better as a team so far and far ahead on the last day but the four sessions also show the U.S. team has the courage that was previously dubious by many, including local fans.
European teams lead 10-6 to the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe brought a comfortable edge on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming back from four balls and four players with 10-6 points over the United States.
Both great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead with two wins over Tiger Woods struggling to bring their wins at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn sought to keep the trophy seized at Hazeltine two years ago, taking over the mistaken American team in the morning session of four balls, with a 3-1 draw.
The U.S. team gave more competition in a four-player game, winning two games, but could not bridge the gap.
Jim Furyk's side need 8 points out of 12 in Sunday's singles match to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European player to win four consecutive points during his time with Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend was the second pair to win four points from their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then jointly defeated Woods and American new player, Bryson Dechambeau in a 5<0x26>4 match.
Woods, who went through two tough games on Saturday, showed off his brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 games to four balls and four players and in seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose, who did not play a break during the morning session of four balls, again sidelined with Henrik Stenson in a four-player match to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2<0x26>1 - ranking one and three in the world.
Europe is not fortunate on a quiet and relaxed day in southwestern Paris.
Three-time major championship winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became gauge timber for America by two points on Saturday.
They won 2<0x26>1 beating Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball match and then again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4<0x26>3 match in a game of four players who lost in the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team that was four points behind heading into a singles match, although as defending champions Furyk only needed to draw to retain the trophy.
After occupying second place for two days, Sunday's counter-attack seemed to be beyond their reach.
North Korea says it is "impossible" that it will voluntarily disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions have caused their deep distrust of the United States and it is unlikely that his country will voluntarily release nuclear weapons in the situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, closing nuclear testing sites and pledging not to expand the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there would be no confidence in the security of our country and in such a situation, it would be impossible for us to voluntarily disarm first."
While Ri denounced complaints against North Korea over Washington's opposition to a "gradual" approach to nuclear cessation where North Korea would be rewarded for it taking a gradual step, his statement seems important because it did not reject voluntary rejection as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and North Korean leaders in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for the "nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula" while Trump provided assurances to North Korea's security.
North Korea is trying to find an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also refused to comply with the recommendations to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "preliminary termination" and increases the level of pressure in the sanctions to achieve their goals by force, and even opposes the "declaration of war's end," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can weaken us is an empty dream of those who don't recognize us.
But the problem is the ongoing restrictions that are exacerbating our distrust."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by the US leader during a United Nations summit earlier this week.
The minister only mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in in the past five months, adding: "If the party on the issue of termination is South Korea and not the US, the nuclear termination from the Korean peninsula will not find a stalemate."
However, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets was inevitable after Trump's "Evil President" named Kim as a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year at a United Nations conference, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work was still to be done and sanctions needed to remain in place until North Korea ended its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we experience the complete, final and verified nuclear cessation."
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dismantle funding of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea in the hours after it had condemned him for making "gangster-like claims."
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to unveil missile sites as well as nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate steps."
He said Kim had told him that "the same steps" that Kim was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and were heading towards a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard students have taken courses to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all its students more sleep in an effort to combat a culture of learning that is increasingly becoming through a caffeine-based 'night-long'.
An instructor finds students at the world's number one universities often unable to understand the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, provided a course he believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving talks about the effects of sleep deprivation during learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and said: ‘Why am I just being told about this now, in my senior year?’
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - and that surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students the need for good sleep habits to aid academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding its students lacked sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves several interactive assignments.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another part, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effects when choosing to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
A proud culture of ‘watching all night’ still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increased stress on students mean sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you have enough sleep quality, it should be the student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making it constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to develop the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete the same learning program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students should consider the use of alarm clocks before and after sleep, and be aware of the dangerous effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can damage your circadian rhythms from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal beats Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss at home when Dolly Menga's net tied Steven Gerrard's weak side with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side are still looking for their first home win since the February 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership league leader Hearts.
He exploded in the seventh minute before the first half and the Rangers didn't seem to have any idea to equalize.
With the Rangers now down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and was just behind Hibernian with a goal difference.
And the Rangers may be in trouble again after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after being blown away by an object from his team's area.
Gerrard made eight changes to his side who reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup after defeating Ayr.
Holt retained the same team as Livi 11 who stole a point from Hearts last week and he is certainly happy with the way his team plays their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have mastered the game but Livingston made more attempts on goal.
They were supposed to score just after two minutes when Aga's first touch gave Scott Pittman space through an Allan McGregor goal but the midfielder missed.
A free-kick from behind Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his defender Alan Lithgow could only send the ball behind the goal.
The Rangers managed to regain control but it remained only hopeful in the last 30 minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a penalty in the forty-fifth minute as he and Steven Lawless clashed but referee Steven Thomson let the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers only managed two tries in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily deflected Lassana Coulibaly's header and weakened Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute might be against the pace of the game, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers again failed to deal with Jacobs' planned moves.
Scott Arfield was only stiff when Declan Gallagher slashed the ball to Scott Robinson who calmly sent it to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard made an exchange during the break by switching Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and it almost gave an immediate impression when the winger gave the ball to Morelos but an impressive Kelly came out of his area to block.
But Livingston continued to make it difficult for the opposing team to play the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sending a long-distance pass for a long-distance pass.
Holt's side were supposed to widen the gap in the final rounds but McGregor defended well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow's header missed from the corner of the goal.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton appealed for another penalty when he collided with Jacobs but again Thomson ignored him.
Almanak: Creator of the Geiger Calculator
And now, the page of our Almanak "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and counting... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device called Geiger Calculator.
As a major foundation of science since then, Counter Geiger has become the backbone of pop culture, as in the film "Bells of Coronado" in 1950, starring the unidentified scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger Calculator, used to look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you use these earphones, you can actually hear the atomic effects of radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: Yeah, it sounds like it now!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the creation that bears his name continues to exist.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify bad cells as part of treatment.
The method involved is to extract the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory.
It can "see" proteins that are common to many cancer cells and then re-injected.
The trial vaccination showed favorable results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman was treated with a vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize bad cells, recovering from her ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein prevalent to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our test results show that we have a very good vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explains Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating this type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined Pro-Trump's cast, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
It is not well received
Kanye West was ridiculed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a great performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would contest in 2020.
After performing his third song that night titled Ghost Town where he wore the ‘Make America Great’ hat, he continued to oppose the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"A lot of times I ask white people and they say, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'
"If I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star garnered Brett Kavanaugh's confession in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Kanye West's footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
I'm not sure if Rock is trying to ridicule West with the post.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he has had difficulties behind the stage about his hat.
"They beat me up behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They bullied me!
Then they said, ‘I’m in a non-essential place,’” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "You want to see that insignificant position?" by saying that he'd be "putting on my superman coat, because this means you can't lead me.
Try the love."
His comments invited ridicule at least twice from the audience and the SNL actors looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one there telling the publication: "The whole studio is so quiet."
West has been brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, where her ex-boyfriend, singer Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West received support from TPUSA's conservative leader Candace Turner, who posted a tweet: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR ABOUT CRITICS."
But a tweet from the host of the interview, Karen Hunter said West was just "being him and it was great."
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I believe accepts and shares ideologies that harm my community.
He's free.
"We too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now known as "the man who was once known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, a rapper, Snoop Dogg once changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course his song refers to the legendary music, Prince, which changed his name to symbol and later as an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in a stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in the Belfast Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington's toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has blinded the stereotypes of the maca hero, by mentioning his character being played on screen means young people often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something was wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-star of Games of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admits she feels "very strong" about tackling the problem.
"I feel a bit strong personally, at the moment - where's our fault with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problems we see today?"
Kit believes television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He added: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel like they need to be this kind of guy?
I think that's one of the most important questions right now - how do we change it?
There's something wrong with today's young people."
In the interview, he also admitted he would not play any prefixes or follow-up to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he was "finished with battlefields and horses."
In November, Kit will star in the remake of True West by Sam Shepard which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a pirate.
The actor recently revealed he considers the meeting with his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so that way, it gave me a future family and my life started from here," she said.

The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are transmitted through sex, signaling a change from the previous one.
HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China due to contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people living with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sexual intercourse is a serious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be growing.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with a man will eventually marry a woman.
Most of the spread of the disease is due to insufficient sexual protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicine as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaked GOP senator data, refuted 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegations of a staff member who posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmaker's Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted the claim had been spread by members of the "ultra-right wing" and the website.
"Deception, fraud and more scams are severe," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, broadcast by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported IP addresses identifying the source of the posts associated with Waters' office and disseminating information from Waters staff members, Hill said.
"These unsubstantiated allegations are false and a lie," Waters said.
"My staff - where their identity, personal information, and security have been compromised due to these false allegations - have absolutely nothing to do with the leak of this information.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and deceptive."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This disclaimer is outrageous," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows that he has no intention of becoming a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of doing something they didn't do, they can't get angry.
They can't resist.
They can't question the motives of the defendants.
They need to be calm."
Fleischer said while comparing Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics who appeared to be too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican contender for Waters in the midterm election, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
“It’s great news if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had notified "the relevant authorities and law enforcement entities of these false allegations.
"We will ensure the perpetrators will be disclosed," he said, "and they will be held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous actions to any and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Rowan Atkinson's weak intelligence scam
It is common now to look for signs of Brexit in any new film with British slang and it seems to apply to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy scam franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a joke about how bad it is for us to become a new country's export opportunity?
In any case, Johnny English's eye-stirring and bored face had the opportunity to ruin the situation for a second time - the name of the gesture which was more than all the thing that he was a widespread comic invention designed for the territory of non-English-speaking moviegoers.
He is, of course, a silly secret agent whose strange character relaxes the glamor of Clouseau's nature, the little Mr. Bean and a musician who contributed a note to the theme song of the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony.
He is also inspired by the mysterious international traveler and spy agent Rowan Atkinson who once appeared in the now forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, leaving the chaos afterwards.
There was a great time or two in the latest movie JE.
I love Johnny English approaching the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and a fan blade attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is being screened, but the jokes feel very weak and strange, especially "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offer comedy as their material.
The joke felt as if it was highlighted for children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's mistake was not innovating and focused on Atkinson's films in Bean's persona.
The main premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's web-secret network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field and disappointing on-site agents - a very small character for Kevin Eldon.
It was the last chance for an arrogant and unpopular prime minister: Emma Thompson gave her best with Teresa May's side character but nothing good in the script for her character.
His intelligence adviser tells him every active spy has been compromised, and he needs to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is clumsy and now works as a schoolteacher in some luxurious places, but provides an inappropriate lesson to be a secret agent: some nice jokes here, as English offers the science of spying in academies like the School of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, betrothed to a submarine commander, a blazing character portrayed by Vicki Pepperdine.
So, Batman and Robin, who are skilled in the Secret Service of Her Majesty, return to action against the beautiful female teaser Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being affected by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problem: the sinister Jason Volta and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventures with a small task: disguised as waitresses, lighting a fire and burning a French restaurant; struggling to smuggle themselves into the luxury cruise ship Volta; and English sparks chaos as he tries to use the headphones of Virtual Reality to get used to the house Volta.
All the funny scenes were brought in well for the last scene, but because it looked friendly and low-noise there was a bit of a taste like a children's television show about it.
It's a relatively simple film.
And just like other Johnny English movies, I kept thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that really fits his talent?
The Labour Party plans to work four days a week but is paid for five days.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that will see Britons work four days a week - but be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to channel the savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It will see staff enjoying the weekend for three days - but still bring home the same salary.
Sources said the idea was "in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country in favor of the workers.
Switching to working for four days a week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "Policy studies are expected to be announced before the end of this year.
"It won't happen overnight but working four days a week is aspiration in line with the party's approach to balancing the economy and in favor of the party's employees and overall industry strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week in an election campaign in 2017.
However, these aspirations are not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labor trial last week by advancing his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power from a "faceless director" and a "crawler" at a utility firm.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire shares because the Labour government can make 'cuts' on the grounds that they are deemed to be wrong.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the company's board of directors and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 percent of private sector firm equity to employees, who will receive an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions as to whether the bureau's findings could influence Republican senators to provide their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more open than his friend from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you I was going to the trial, I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, whose charge came up, and said, 'Did you do it?'
He's strong, strong, clear."
However, Graham's decision has been made.
“I have already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and he will take serious allegations,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know about this: Brett has persistently denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he named couldn't confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any change."
Is the World People's Party and has the event done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World People's Festival, an annual music event with an impressive array of great stars and an equally great mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World People's Party will see tens of thousands of people gathered at the Greater Central Park Site to not only watch performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Party, started in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international support group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive free tickets for this event (unless you're willing to pay for VIP tickets), these concert visitors will need to complete some tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls or any other meaningful means to help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how far will the rest of the world go with the remaining 12 years to reach their goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a sincere way to persuade people to demand action, or is it just another case of "clicktivism" - making someone feel like they've done something by simply signing a petition online or by sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said it has recorded 19 million "actions" from its supporters, urging movements with different goals.
They say these actions have helped drive world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than <0x24>37 billion that will bring change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, and at least <0x24>10 billion of that amount had already been collected or had already been collected.
The group also estimates that the fund has impacted nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some key committees include Nutrition Power, a partnership between UK-based investors and investors committed to "helping children to their full potential", promising to donate <0x24>35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate the country's unbalanced diet after receiving more than 4,700 bribes from Gobal Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, federal governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make this uneven dietary social injustice a historical past," Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman said at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said after receiving more than 5,000 calls for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced to finance a project, Power of Nutrition, which will now reach 5 million women and children in need.
Answering one of the FAQs on his website, he asked "what makes you think we can end hard poverty?"
Global Citizen has responded: "This is a difficult path and will take time - sometimes we will be disappointed and discouraged.
But, just as the movement demanded civil rights and antiapartheid before, we will succeed, because when we work together we will get stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who also performed at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a "restriction" to prevent Russia from exporting oil - Home Secretary
Washington could "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russia from selling its oil on the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said in a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - as it is known, involved themselves at the invitation of the Syrian government - purportedly to find a new oil market.
"I believe their presence in the Middle Tmur is to control the oil supply as they have done in eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And according to the officer, there is a way to address this issue.
"The United States has the capability, with our Navy, to keep the sea routes open, and if necessary, to prevent their oil from being marketable," he said.
Zinke said that during a speech at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a not-for-profit group that describes itself as the "voice of oil consumers" in the US.
He also compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, and stressed that the actions were the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are more or less the same, affecting and replacing oil," he said, referring to Russia as having no other option and with its oil-dependent economy.
This statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of much cheaper liquid natural gas to Europe to consumers in Europe, replacing Russia.
Trump officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said would make Berlin occupied by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project will have an existing pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic metres and is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin denies that Washington is so strongly opposed to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy supplies cannot be used as a weapon of pressure and that consumers should be free to vote," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said during a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. action has sparked dissatisfaction with Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industrial organization, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy as well as on the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our country's energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladmir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "cooked" to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senators say.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "think carefully" before becoming a presidential candidate following a midterm election.
When the question was open to residents in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider competing.
"It's time for a woman to head to Washington and improve our divisive government and this includes putting a woman on top of her," he said.
"After November 6th, I'm going to be thinking about being a presidential candidate."
Warren expressed his concern for President Donald Trump during an open questioning, saying that Trump "is driving our country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has strongly criticized Trump for nominating Brett Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Federal Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote is made."
However, a survey on Thursday showed the majority of the population in the area represented by Warren felt Warren should not compete in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not contest, according to a survey of the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Studies Center.
Thirty-two percent supported him.
The poll also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to contest, with 38 per cent supporting his potential to contest and 48 per cent disagreeing.
The names of other high-profile Democrats who were also discussed as potential candidates in 2020 were former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at the Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged for domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is facing, after coming home, I can feel the feelings of other families who are suffering from PTSD and those who are coming home with injuries," he said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his son's detention was "significant" and said of his son and other war veterans as, "they came home differently, quite loudly and wondered if they would be flattered for their sacrifices to the country."
He was detained on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, disrupting reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons while drunk, according to Dan Bennet, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, Washington supports opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia advocated against a U.S. policy that prevents asylum to victims fleeing attacks by terror groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts made a friend's registration to the court on Jummat's day in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposed the policy, NBC news reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. The suit session made by the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his spouse and "members of his son's violent group" had tortured him but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have the most number of people applying for asylum in the U.S., as a country filled with problems of evil groups and domestic violence.
The new policy of U.S. asylum applications returns a decision made in 2014 in which the Immigrant Appeal Board has allowed migrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia State Public Prosecutor Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "does not abide by state, federal and international laws that have existed decades ago."
"Federal law requires all applications for asylum to be decided on the facts and circumstances that lead to the application, and prevents it from violating the principle," a friend said in a statement to the court.
Prosecutors also disputed the policy, which prevents migrants from entering the U.S. economy, saying it is likely that these migrants will become entrepreneurs and "become the necessary workforce."
Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions has ordered an immigration judge to no longer grant asylum to victims who have fled due to domestic violence crimes and the violence of malicious groups in June.
Asylum will be given to those who leave their homeland for fear of being oppressed because of racism, religion, nationality or because they belong to a particular social group or adhere to different political holdings," Sessions said when announcing the policy on June 11.
Asylum is not meant to solve all the problems -- even if all the problems are serious -- that everyone in the world faces on a daily basis.
Rescue work is getting more frequent in Palu while death toll doubles
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"It's very depressed," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was feeding her feverish baby boy in the city centre of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
There's very little drinking water."
Residents seem to be slowly returning to their homes that have been wrecked, looking for their belongings in the water while trying to save what could.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were damaged as a result of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
Among the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken spine and shoulder injury, were at rest outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to an aftershock.
Tears flowed as he looked back as the quake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Nothing to save ourselves.
I was squeezed into a collapsed wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family were in the city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife's voice screaming for help, and then I kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and children.
I hope they're safe.
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with ‘propaganda advertising’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper detailing the common good of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused China of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid ad in the Des Moines Register - the most-sold newspaper in Iowa state - after accusing China of trying to interfere in congressional elections on Nov. 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's allegations that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election explain what U.S. officials have reported to Reuters as a new phase in the campaign to pressure China.
It is common practice for foreign governments to broadcast ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now embroiled in an escalating trade war with each imposing tariffs on their imports.
China's initial action in the trade war is to target exporters in states such as Iowa who support the Republican Party represented by Trump, Chinese and U.S. state experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said the move had troubled many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a newspaper room in the Des Moines Register on Sunday wrote, "now it's more bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own independent newspaper."
"In publishing this propaganda, the Chinese government accepts the freedom practiced by the Americans, a tradition that prioritises freedom of speech and freedom of the press," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in newspapers in Beijing, there is very little opposition and you can't see the people's real views on China's economic direction which is worrying because their media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of China's leading newspapers has shunned offers to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans Reject Female Voters Ahead of Midterm Elections Because of Kavanaugh's Story, Warnings by Analysts
While many prominent Republicans support and favor Brett Kavanaugh, a Federal Court candidate facing charges of sexual harassment, analysts warned they would invite a response particularly from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The high emotion envelops this story and most Republicans say in their records will continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be changed," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University in an article published on Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher is unsure of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s move to force the FBI to start an investigation is enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and also in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" while expressing feelings in the Senate building compound as Republicans ruling the Judiciary Committee voted to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic passion and motivation will explode," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's too high; it's true.
This may be higher especially for female voters who will vote from the suburbs and young voters, 18-29 years old, they dislike the president and rarely vote.
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault on him by the Federal Court candidates, analysts thought there would be opposition if Republicans continued with confirmation.
"This has been a very complicated thing for the GOP," Michael Steela, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC news.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh succeeds as a federal judge, it's also about how Republicans deal with this issue and how they treat him," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helped select Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided in two and don't know who to trust in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony with more than half in favor of Ford.
A recent YouGov survey showed 41 percent said they would believe or might believe Ford's testimonials, while 35 percent said they believed or might believe Kavanaugh.
Meanwhile, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh might or would have cheated in his testimonials, while only 30 percent spoke the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other allegations, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian newspaper reported.
Ford made an oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had abused him in a drunken state when he was 17.
Ramirez also said the Federal Court candidate also showed his genitals in front of Ford during a party while he was studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Website Creator Plans to Start a New Internet Network to rival Google and Facebook
World Website creator Tim Berners-Lee launched a startup company to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that uses open source software-based Solid invented by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be entitled to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's real purpose was "to rule the world."
"We need to do this now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, daily work lists, calendars, song lists and other personal professional equipment.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that are available in one browser and simultaneously.
What's unique about data storage in this private talan is that it's up to the user for who can access the type of information needed.
The company calls it "personal control through data."
Ihlam for Inrupt, according to its CEO John Bruce, is to bring certain resources, processes and expertise to help people enjoy Solid.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several contracted developer staff to work on the project and a community of volunteer codewriters.
Starting this week, tech developers from all over the world can create their own independent apps without being centered on any location by using the equipment available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team had no discussions with "Facebook and Google to introduce or not introduce a change in which all of their business models will change immediately.
"We are not asking for their truth."
In a press release in Medium on Saturday, Bernes-Lee wrote, "The mission is to provide a business power and ecosystem to help protect the intergrity and quality of new websites built using Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the world of the Internet when he founded the World Website Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been debating the need for websites to be free.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Website Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic for the new era of the website,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: First World War Victorian Cross Recipient Celebrated
The only priest from the Church of England who received the Victoria Cross award during the First World War as a combat soldier was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Benard Vann received the award on September 29, 1918 in the attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and did not immediately know he had ever known that he had been awarded the highest British army award.
A memorial stone was erected and opened by two of his grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his granddaughters, Michael Vann, said it was a "glorious symbol" because the stone would be unveiled 100 years after his grandfather's brave actions.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann carried his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "filled with thick fog and endured a terrible assault of machine guns."
Then he slid into the border and with "extraordinary courage" and led it before sliding down with a rifle alone and shooting three men.
Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – a month before the war ended.
Micheal Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I couldn’t possibly repeat and were so touching.”
He and his younger brother Dr. James Vann also placed a loop of flowers after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Pancaragama.
Micheal Vann said it was "very honourable to be part of this demonstration" and added "true courage with the support that so many people have given."
MMA fans stay up all night watching Bellator 206, instead they are given Peppa Pig
Just imagine, you're up all night watching the Bellator 206 but are disappointed from watching the main show.
San Jose's list of 13 matches, including six major matches, will be live on Channel 5 every night in the UK.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to collide, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast switched to Peppa Pig's show.
Some of them were angry because they stayed up all night to watch the match.
One of the fans said the exchange to the children's cartoon channel was "an unpleasant joke" through his tweets.
"Government rules show that broadcasts at 6 a.m. are not suitable for matches so they are forced to broadcast broadcasts for children," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior deputy president of marketing and communications when asked about the transmission.
"Oh my gosh, yeah."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they are working to reschedule the broadcast so that viewers in the UK can watch it.
"I think, when I talk about re-release, I think we can do something," Coker said.
“But at six in the morning on Sunday it is not possible for us to do anything until our Sunday time, which is their Monday time.
We're working on it.
Trust me, there are a lot of changes to the post and it's not good to hear.
We're trying to solve this problem, we think it's a technical problem.
But no, it's more about the government.
I promise this won't happen in the future.
"We're going to limit it to five games instead of six - as usual - and we're trying to do something that's impossible for the fans.
It's a poor situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's sense of "lowliness" towards sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior due to his own sexuality - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old didn't realize anything until he went to high school and felt "not everyone is like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she spoke about the right of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also spoke after his father's title, he wasn't very concerned about winning at the Olympics.
The presenter remains in this long-running show, Kris Young is on vacation for several months due to illness.
Her sudden appearance in Laverne's first show, Daley said she felt "less than" peers when growing up because "she wasn't socially accepted as either male or female."
He said: "To this day, feeling less than others and feeling different from others have been the things that have encouraged me and given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a high-profile campaigner for the LBGT and has made use of his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia so that more countries will no longer turn homosexuality into a crime.
He said he spoke this way because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any problems and wanted to give "hope" to others like him.
The three-time world champion said the event fell in love with a man - U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - was "unexpected at all."
Daley married the Oscar winner who was 20 years older than she was last year but said their age gap was never an issue.
"When you went through so much experience at such a young age" - he joined the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone in this age environment who was going through the same challenges.
The couple became a father in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said "all the previews" of his life have now changed.
"If you asked me last year, it's just about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"There's really something more than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son's name was given to his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with cancer in the brain.
Daley said his father did not want to accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether their tickets to London 2012 had been bought - because he wanted to sit in front of them once.
“I don’t have the heart to say ‘Dad won’t be there to sit in the front row’,” he said.
"I was still holding my father's hand when he stopped breathing and not until my dad stopped breathing and was legally dead I realized that my dad would not live forever," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I realize this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to jump in front of my fans in my own country in the Olympics, there's nothing else that can match this," he said.
It was also a source of inspiration for his first selection of songs - "Proud" by Heather Small - that chirped with him during his preparations for the Olympics and still made his roman fur dim.
Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is not ready for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday when he plays for his 47th time in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to be ready to make up for the game's performances in order not to end in grief.
Mickelson, who will play in the biennial event for a record 12 times, was rested by captain Jim Furyk for a game of "fourballs" and "foursomes" on Saturday.
Despite being the usual focus for the United States, the winner of these five major competitions spent time being a cheerleader and training in hopes of improving the quality of the game.
A man who can't hit the ball straight even at the peak of his game, the 48-year-old is not the right choice for the Le Golf National golf course, where long distances are very difficult for a shot that doesn't hit the target.
And if the golf course is just a challenge, Mickelson in Sunday's ninth match will face British Open winner Francesco Molinari who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If an American player, four points behind, starts with 12 singles games, starts with a fierce start, then Mickelson's game is definitely very important.
Furyk is so confident in his players, that's all he can say.
"He understands his role today, and pats his shoulders and puts his hand on my shoulder and says he'll be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
“His confidence is very high.
He's been a big fan and has contributed a lot to this team for a long time, and this week.
I don’t think he’s going to play in two games.
I imagined more than that, but that's how and how we think we should do it.
He wants to be the same, like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most appearances in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the last time he will join the Ryder Cup that has never matched his personal record.
Mickelson won 18, lost 20 and drew seven, although Furyk said his presence brought one injection of spirit to his team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he likes to joke, he likes to wear people and it's fun when he's in the team room," she said.
"I think all the young players are having fun with him, this week, and it's good to see him.
He's not just playing, he's playing more than that.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows their leading position will soon disappear
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that a far ahead position he had could have lost in the final day of the Ryder Cup and complicate the situation.
The Danish first participated in the 1997 competition at Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros drove as captain and outscored the Americans by 5 points but managed to win very thinly with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself after the leading position at Valderrama; we also got the leading position at Brookline but we lost and at Valderram we won, but we won thin," Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 Class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to be ahead with 10-6 points at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in that team that this game is not over yet.
We're going to fight hard tomorrow.
Go out and play hard and don't make mistakes.
It's not over until the eyes have been picked up and inscribed on the board.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and we will focus on it.
I said, I'm going to focus on the 12 players in our team, but we all need to know who our opponents are - they are the best players in the world.
Excited by his team's achievements on such a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I couldn't have guessed.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow's achievements need to be highlighted and that's something different to do.
It's great to be out there with friends and when things are going well, but when you're alone, your full capacity as a golfer will be tested.
This is the message all players need to hear, give the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he'll have to give his best in him too."
Contrary to Bjorn's views, his opponent Jim Furyk would expect his players to play well as an individual player compared to a team event, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to get three points from four.
Furyk himself had an experience on the last day of his career, when he was on the winning team at Brookline before the surprise loss when the European team performed the "Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every word," he said when answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, burned the spirit of the player on the last day.
"We have 12 more events tomorrow, but if you all want to get started as quickly as you can see on Brookline, as you can see in Medina.
When the momentum starts, it will put pressure on the event in the middle.
"We're going to line up our players in a way that we think is right, we're going to try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of fighting back and colliding with Rory McIlroy in the main event, alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter European players who were in the top spot of the first division.
"I made this rule because I think it's going to fit in and cover everything," Bjorn said of the individual player's choice.
Germany's new warships are delayed again
The German Navy should have received its newest frigate in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but the ship will not be ready until next year due to system malfunctions and rising costs, according to local media reports.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Pfalz" warship, the first ship under the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate brand, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman.
This warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, unfortunately post-submission problems hit the fate of this big project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class frigates.
Understandably, it will contain features such as high-power guns, a variety of anti-aircraft and anti-ship equipment as well as some invisibility features such as reduced detection by radar, red lights and acoustic capabilities.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance timeframe - this latest frigate must be able to sail up to two years from its base.
However, various obstacles meant these sophisticated warships that were said to be capable of accentuating German power abroad - would be outdated by the time the ship joined the Navy, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when German Navy officials refused to charter the warship in and return it to the shipbuilding company Blohm <0x26> Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to its builder after delivery.
Not much is known about why the ship was sent back, but German newspapers mentioned some of the damage "software and devices" rendered the warship useless if sent for combat missions.
Damage to the software should be taken seriously as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warship will be operated by only 120 sailors - half of what is needed to handle the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is also the case that these warships are too heavy and this will reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to make any improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as any warship of the same class used by the German army during World War II.
In addition to damage to the device, the price of the entire project - including training for sailors - is also an issue.
The project is said to have hit <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - up from its original price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2bn.
The problem afflicting the new frigates demonstrates how much the German naval capabilities are missing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy was facing a shortage of mobilized warships.
The official also said the issue was getting worse, as the old warship that had been stopped did not get a replacement warship.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
National Trust settles the life of bats
A recent study is underway at an estate in the Scottish highlands to explain why bats use the shape of the face of the earth to hunt for food.
It is hoped that this study will lead to the latest findings on the behavior of unique mammals capable of flying and can serve as a guide for conservation activities.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow regular bats, and soprano bats pipistrelles as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in certain locations around the property to keep track of bat activity throughout the season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also make mobile surveys using mobile tracking tools.
Experts analyze the sound of all recordings will identify the frequency of each type of bat and its species and the actions of these bats.
A map of the habitat and a report will be created to create a scaled-up image of the Earth's surface with respect to bat behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser to NTS, hopes the results of the study will show the most important habitat areas for bats and how they are used by each bat species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management such as making grazing pastures and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined considerably over the last century.
Bats are threatened as a result of building and construction work that disrupts where bats settle and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lights are also a risk to bats as well as fly trap paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials as well as pet cat attacks.
The bat is not actually blind.
Because bats hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use location detection techniques using sound to identify the position of insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country are of great importance to bats.
They have ten trained experts who often conduct surveys, check landing spots and sometimes save bats.
The organization has also established one of Scotland's first bat shelters at Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which is where eight out of ten bat species in Scotland live.
David Thompson, the estate manager, said it was the most suitable place for bats.
"There's a place where we can find a good place for bats," he said.
"We have an old building, lots of large trees and suitable habitat.
There’s a lot more we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to live and thrive.
He stressed how important it is to conduct inspections before starting maintenance work in real estate because there is a possibility that we could accidentally destroy bat nests that would contain bat children where this could kill 400 female bats and bats, and possibly destroy the entire population of local bats.
Bats are protected and it is a mistake to kill, molest or disturb or destroy the nesting grounds of bats.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: "There is still a lot we have to learn about bats and for many species we don't know how their populations are growing."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyer prepares to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of raping him as "fake news" and said people wanted to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing the allegations.
The Portuguese forward and Juventus are accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He said he had paid <0x24>375,000 to cover his mouth, according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news."
"It's not true.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
Typically.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, this is part of my work.
I'm happy and everything is fine," the player said with a smile.
Cristiano Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue De Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "an unsubstantiated and intrusive report of personal space," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz's lawyer said the player would seek damages for "the moral damages that directly affect his personality, which may have been one of the most serious personal rights abuses in recent years."
The incident was reported in June 2009 in a luxury room of the Hotel Palms and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of molesting the woman without permission, according to an investigation paper registered at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed after the incident that the player knelt in front of him and said he was "99 per cent" a "good guy" and fell down for only "one per cent."
The document confirms Ronaldo admitting to having sex, but on the basis of similar likes.
Mayorga also claimed she filed a police report and took pictures of the injuries sustained while in the hospital, but later agreed to settle them out of court because she was "fearful of the response" and worried about being "publicly ridiculed."
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel her previous settlement as she is still traumatized by what has happened.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester at the time of the allegations, and this summer he moved to Italian football giants Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' losing car manufacturer
The UK "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, Trade Secretary Greg Clark said.
Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the European Union without a solution, it will temporarily stop production of its factory cars in Burnsaston, near Derby.
"We need a solution," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of this would result in shipping problems at the border if there was no solution for Brexit and this would lead to job losses.
The factory in Burnaston - which manufactured Toyota Auris and Avensis cars - installed nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my view if Britain leaves the European Union without a solution at the end of March, we will stop producing cars in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover have said they are concerned if the UK leaves the European Union without a solution on how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini car factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is about the risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without a solution.
The production of Toyota cars depends on the installation basis based on the timely receipt of supplies without having to be kept with the parts of the car brought to the factory every 37 minutes from across the UK and the European Union for the cars booked.
If the UK exits the European Union without a solution on March 29, it is likely that there will be a chaos at the border that industry players are predicting will be delayed and a shortage of spare parts.
Toyota is unlikely to be able to keep inventory supplies for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will be halted.
Mr Clark said the future plans of Finance Minister Theresa May for bilateral relations with the European Union "must be done with certainty to avoid any border checks."
"We need a solution. We want a solution that will allow not only success for the present but for us to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC on Radio 4's Today programme.
"Evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we must continue with this highly successful supply chain.
Toyota can't say how long production will be discontinued, but in the long run it warns of rising costs and reducing the factory's competitiveness, resulting in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the union responsible for the management of the union at the factory, said the union members had begun to worry: "According to my experience, the lost jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and robust plan for the future relationship between us and the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
A crucial meeting between Donald Trump and deputy prosecutor Rod Rosenstein may be "rejected into next week" as disputes over Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy as a federal court candidate continue, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein, who oversees the work of Robert Mueller's special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia and the possibility of obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire deputy prosecutors or not and further disrupt Mueller's freedom to continue the investigation has become the hottest gossip in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein planned to use a secret recording device to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of replacing the president by using an amendment to the 25th constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, behind reports that he was about to resign.
Instead it announced a meeting on Thursday with Trump that was at the time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was "not willing" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to prevent him from colliding with Kavanaugh's confession and Dr Christine Blassey Ford one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of molesting him, in front of the Senate judiciary committee, which both of them gave confessions.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations, postponing further full voting in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared in Fox news on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date hasn't been set yet, maybe in this week, I think it may be postponed for another week because of some of the things that are happening in the federal court.
We'll see, and I'll always keep you up to date with the news.
Some reporters will argue: Sanders hasn't held any White House press conferences since September 10.
When the host, Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said he did not hold a lot of press conferences not because he disliked TV reporters who were trying to find "attention" but he also said: "I disagree because they really want attention."
He said relations between the media and Trump would increase.
"The president has held the most question-and-answer sessions compared to the presidents before him," he said without providing any evidence. "We have calculated."
A press conference will be held, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States something directly, it's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen us doing it a lot over the last few weeks and this will replace a press conference when you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from newspapers when on his way out of the White House or while participating in open question-and-answer sessions or during press conferences along with honor guests.
Media gatherings are very rare.
This week in New York, the president pointed out why he sometimes made an independent and bizarre appearance in front of gathered reporters.
The health secretary writes to EU workers in the NHS about their concerns about Brexit
The secretary of state has written a letter to all workers from the European Union working in NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hopes they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to cover the costs of applying for European Union residents who work in the public sector.
In his letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the withdrawal have continued, and are heading to reach a decision by autumn.
But the UK government has stepped up preparations for a scenario without a solution.
I know this is something that worries you all.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each of you, regardless of your nationality.
Partners from across the European Union and other countries bring together a wealth of experience and expertise that strengthens and improves health services and benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you all to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury after losing 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before the second half.
"He approached the edge line and suddenly collapsed there," Reed said.
The trainer and health officer gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting him in a shelter and taking him for further treatment.
An official from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information about the type/degree of the injury at the moment" and Tennessee State is trying to identify when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-year student in the red shirt, played his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He made five appearances on Saturday before leaving the game, his total this season was 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the surplus will be used to help homeless people under Tory's latest plan.
This move will undermine Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
This stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Treasury is expected to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - money from this will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May said today.
The move seems to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with the promise of providing affordable housing and making high-income people a target.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, the money from these proceeds will help the government address the problem of homeless people.
This addition - an addition to stamp duties that have already been imposed including higher duties that were introduced two years ago on a second home and a house purchased for rent which may be imposed by 3%.
The Treasury is expected to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year through this step.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, causing prices to soar and making it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Most luxurious areas - especially in the capital - have become "silent" as many of their owners are foreign owners who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded that stamp duty be reduced so that more young people could afford their first home.
He accused large construction companies of deliberately maintaining high real estate prices by buying land but not developing it, and urged Mrs May to eliminate quotas on affordable homes to address Britain's "humiliating housing problem."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of exciting housing reform proposals, including rent control and abolishing "innocent" evictions.
He also wanted more power to be given to the council members to build a new house.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term as prime minister to revive the British dream - this life must improve for every generation to come.
And that means improving our poor housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to stay, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair as it is very easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based overseas to buy a home compared to the British residents who work hard here.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is far from over, and the fact of living everywhere with a sense of humiliation is a reality.
Jack Ross: ‘My main goal is to manage Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa said his "principal goal" was to become Scotland's manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scot is looking forward to a challenging opportunity to reassure the North-East side, who are third in League One, less than three points from the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for the B cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportssound.
"I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there was something that always pulled me there.
The opportunity will only come if I succeed as a manager at the club level.
Ross' replacements as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athetic manager said he did not feel that he was following the footsteps of such a name in big clubs, as he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"For me the meaning of success at the moment is 'can I bring this club back into the Premier League?
"Because of the structure and facilities at the club, it should be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to achieve, but I would consider myself a success if I could return the club to the Premier League."
Ross is only three years in management, having been assistant manager at Dumbarton and one of the coaches at Hearts for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa return to level three after being relegated and changed St Mirren's fortune from being relegated to Champion the following season.
Ross said he is more comfortable now than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's an option," he recalled, when managing Alloa.
"I know I'm playing with the team rather than playing with it.
It may sound strange because I've been able to live a good life and enjoy some interesting moments.
Playing is a bit difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
"I'm still going through it in terms of pressure and pressure working as a player but as a manager I'm more comfortable.
I've always wanted to take care of it and now I'm doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something I've loved all my adult life."

The best time to drink beer is at 5:30pm on Saturday, according to a study.
This summer's heatwave brought luck to British pubs who were in trouble but chained restaurants were also under pressure.
Pubs and bars showed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but in restaurants it fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA's business consulting firm, which compiled these figures, said: "The continued hot weather and longer England World Cup campaigns mean July will follow the pattern of June, where pubs are up 2.8 per cent, unless restaurants are declining even worse.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurants in June was worse in July.
The performance of the pub that prioritizes drinks and bars is very strong compared to the restaurants that are declining.
Food-priority pubs also suffer from bad luck due to the hot weather, but are not as bad as restaurant operators.
Apparently most people just go out for a beer.
Pubs and bars recorded a 6.6 percent increase in sales for the month, while food fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM's entertainment and food analyst, said: "This decision seems to be the same and has been ongoing since the end of April.
Weather and social events or sporting events are still major factors in the increase in sales in the outdoors market.
Unsurprisingly, the restaurant group continued to squeeze, selling down 4.8 percent if compared to this year would have been worse with the cost pressure again.
The long summer heat weather hit restaurant operators at severe times and only time will determine if a cooler weather like the one we experienced in August will bring relief."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, indicating a slowdown in brand newly introduced.
The Coffer Peach Tracker's sales sector, bars and restaurants collected and analyzed the performance of data from 47 groups operating with a <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion turnover is the industry's benchmark.
One in five children has social media accounts they hide from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - has secret social media accounts they hide from parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the page "Fake Insta"
This news further increases the potential danger of sexual content being sent through it.
Twenty percent of students say they have one "primary" account to show to their parents.
One in five children - some just 11 - opened a social media account they kept secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a sharp increase in "false Insta" accounts - a reference to Instagram's photo-sharing site.
This news increases the risk of possible sexual content being sent through it.
Twenty percent of students said they used a clean "primary" account to show their parents, while owning one personal account.
A mother found the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter who urged people to "rape me."
A study by the UK Digital Awareness and Conference of Teachers (HCM) independent schools found 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with more than half of them admitting they kept personal accounts.
HCM chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming to see so many teenagers stuck creating online spaces where parents and teachers can't keep track of them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice to athletes" in Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director during the general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a well-known Scottish race athlete and chairman Ian Beattie explained this move is an opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from Doyle's rich international experience of more than a decade.
"Ilith is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from his participation in this board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of all athletes and I look forward to contributing and helping guide the sport at Scotand.
The American sportsman, who won a gold medal for the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, now has four Olympic gold medals and now makes coverage for the BBC, having been unable to walk due to a transient ischemic attack.
He said: "I had a stroke last month.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time could determine the extent to which I could recover.
It's not easy to be what I used to be, I need to learn to walk again and today I need to do intelligence training!
Thank you for all your support!"
Maternal milk pump advertising that makes comparisons with cows brings conflicting opinions online
A mother's milk pump manufacturer got a wide range of conflicting opinions online as their ads compared breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked for milk.
To launch what is said to be the world's first "silent and wearable breast milk pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a music video in the form of a joke to showcase the freedom that mothers can feel using the new pump.
Four mothers danced in a haystack to a song where the lyrics read: "Yes, I am pumping my own milk, but you can't see any tails" and "if you don't realize this isn't a nipple, this is my breasts."
"Pam out, pump out, pump out, I'm breastfeeding, pump out, pump out, I'm pumping my boobs."
However, this ad published on the company's Facebook page has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, the video has attracted a wide range of reactions from the general public, many saying it gives a glimpse of the dairy industry's "surprising" look.
"It's an unreasonable decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows need to conceive and have children to produce milk, but unfortunately calves are divorced from cows within a few days of their birth," said one author.

Another commented: "It is indeed a trauma for cows and calves.
"But why not use them to advertise milk pumps for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another added: "An ad that has nothing to do with it."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "absolutely ridiculous."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy one if I'm still breastfeeding.
It makes me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I think it's as if it were.
"It's a great product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that praises or assesses the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they've all been dancing with a pump hidden in their underwear.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the assumption that most women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pam is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be hiddenly loaded in a breastfeeding shirt, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By equating women pumping with breastfeeding cows, we wanted to put breastfeeding and all the challenges associated with it as the main focus, while demonstrating a way of entertaining and connecting with feelings of freedom through the use of new pumps.
This isn't the first time Elvis has made a headline.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two showed up on stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children are quietly moving to camps on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrants is on the rise even though monthly border transfers have not changed much, due to the rhetoric and heavy policies introduced by the Trump administration, making it increasingly difficult to place children with guarantors.
According to tradition, guarantors are undocumented immigrants, and they are afraid to compromise their position to continue living in the country if they take a child.
Risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective guarantors and other adult members in the family would have to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, testified before Congress that the agency had detained dozens of individuals who had applied to be guarantors to unguarded children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those detained had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are either underwriters or members of the underwriter's family are here illegally and most of them are illegal immigrants.
With that, we will continue to hunt those individuals," Albence said.
To process children more quickly, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, not after 60 days according to their previous standards, according to protection workers.
Many will be present through video conference calls, rather than being present in person, to appeal their case for a valid position before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer the child is in custody, they will be more likely to become anxious or depressed, and this will lead to an angry act or attempt to escape, according to protection officials and according to reports released by the system in recent months.
Proponents say that the concern is higher in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that children are struggling with feelings may not be detected, due to the size of the place.
They added that by moving children to the campsite without making time for them to be emotionally ready, or saying goodbye to friends might exacerbate the trauma they are experiencing.
Syria's U.S., French and Turkish forces withdraw immediately
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return, despite the war in the country reaching its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism "will be subjected to appropriate action."
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the conference.
Moualem stressed that the "war on violence has ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy war until we wipe out Syria" from both violent groups and "any foreign occupation".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, specializing in training and advising Kurdish and Arab Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the situation was appropriate for them to return, and he accused "some foreign countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led to refugees not returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help this return," he said.
"They're politicizing things that should be just a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The U.N. diplomat said the agreement between Russia and Turkey to provide a military-free zone in the rebel-held area of Idlib had created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Russian-Turkish talks have diverted a major offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian army in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "a real time limit" and expects military action to target jihadists including rebels from the Nusra Front linked to Al Qaeda, which "will be abolished."
UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to arrange the first meeting of the new committee, which contains the government and opposition members to draft a post-war development and pave the way for elections.
Moualem stated the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the work of the panel should be limited to "revising current constitutional articles," and warned against disruption.
Trump will win a second term.
With that in mind, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless, as liberal observers expect, charges of sacking and scandals end his presidential post before his time.
In a situation that is undeniably "the most dramatic finale for a president's office!"
At the moment, there is no sign of a leak.
Since 2014, the prime time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average prime time viewership of 2.4 million, in addition to 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the cable rating, up to 3.5 million viewers on the eve of the premiere newscast.
"This is a fire that catches people's attention because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC's drama "Designated Survivor," a story about a cabinet secretary who became president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
He recalled a taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is value in entertainment.
True, unlike those on TV, storylines originating in Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite or the health of the global economy.
Not following the development is only a pleasure for the fortunate audience.
However, it goes a long way from being a knowledgeable citizen when you find you're watching a panel of experts arguing about the use of 'deep background' by Bob Woodward' in finding a source for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's <0x24>15,000 ostrich-skin bomber jacket ("heavy fabric with majesticity," says The Washington Post) and a full description of sensationality by Stormy Daniels about ah Trump.
I’m not going to see Super Mario with the same view again.
"Part of what he's doing is like in a reality program that looks like he's bribing you with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars," about Trump's story with an actor exchange and a daily plot exchange (starting a fight with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).

When I visited Fleiss this week, the weather outside his home north of Kauai was sunny 80 degrees, but he was absorbed in the house watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
He can't leave the TV, not when Brett Kavanaugh is set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is still uncertain.
"I remember when we were making crazy shows and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it was real."

External money floods into fierce contests of the Middle House election
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th election saw a flood of money, as a reunification of congressional districts saw two officials now contesting for the same seat.
The remixed suburban district of Pittsburgh contested representative Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in the previous spring's special election.
Lamb is competing against another current official, Republican representative Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of old Pennyslvania, overlapping with the new 17.
The map was redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district had been digerrymandering the Republican side.
The new 17th competition has kicked off a fierce financial campaign competition between the main party's financial machinery of the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a common name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennyslvania.
The seat has been won by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county by 20 points.
The clever political genius has given Democrats an edge.
U.S. Counts on Financing El Salvador for Support for China, Then Resigns
The Dominican Republic and Panama diplomats have recognised Beijing, with little negative response from Washington.
Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partner kicked out of the Trump Organization's management team.
Government Department officials decided to call back the heads of American diplomatic representation from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decision to disown Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines imposed only on El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including narcotics control and economic support.
The proposed fines, including deductions on financial aid and visa restrictions, will have a negative impact on the Central American nation with high unemployment and homicide rates.
After an internal meeting, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in preventing migrants heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials decided they wanted the conference to continue, effectively halting any consideration for El Salvador's fines.
Deputy President Mike Pence will now give a speech at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the import of administrative venues at the meeting, the diplomat said.
And all three American representatives returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no firm messages or fines from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on condition of anonymity.
Their evidence is supported by outside analysts who are close to the administration and also speak on condition of anonymity.
History Studies
What's next may be Robert Mueller's special counsel's report on the possibility of a obstruction of justice by Trump, which now has strong evidence in the public record.
Mueller will also lead an investigation into whether Trump's campaign has joined Russia in an attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face responsibility on that side, as soon as he's ready to face voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This is all if, and I'm not saying that Trump's fall is bound to happen - or people like him in Europe.
There are choices that all of us have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long this struggle lasts.
In 1938, German officials prepared for an attempted coup against Hitler, had the West not followed Hitler and supported the Czechoslovak in Munich.
We've failed, and we've missed the opportunity to avoid the brutal killings that took place in the next few years.
The course of history revolves around such an inflection point, and the unstoppable course of democracy will be accelerated or suspended.
The American people are facing some of these points of inflection now.
What would we do if Trump fired Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversees Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that, last year, he had planned to make a presidential recording and speculate that the president was not eligible for the post.
Rosenstein said The Times' statement was inaccurate.
"How will we act if the FBI's new investigation request for Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the apparent allegations of sexual assault and evidence of fraud?
And more importantly, are we going to vote for the half-term of the Congress to which Trump will be held accountable?
If we fail the test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was of Czechoslovak Jewish descent who had been deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had conquered my embassy home.
He survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table that had a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dornans of Rangers is optimistic about battle with Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the win against Austria, following a draw with Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify them in Group G in the European League.
An injury in the knee prevented midfielder Graham Dornans from making his senior appearance this season up to a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers are using this decision as a stepping stone to a great win.
"It's a good point because Villarreal are a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We played in this game with the confidence that we're going to get something and we've got one point.
We could have won at the end of the game, but the draw could have been a more fair result.
They probably played better in the first half and we played better in the second half and in the better side.
On Thursday, another great night in Europe.
We hoped we would get three points but the competition was difficult because they had a good result in the previous game but, the crowd supported us, I'm sure we'll play well and get a positive result.
"Last year was difficult, between everything that happened with my injuries, and the commitment to the club, but there is a lot of fun about this place right now.
The squad is good and the team feels good; training is good too.
We hope we can do our best, leave last season and succeed."
Women can't sleep because of the anxiety of these pension savings.
While the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be preserved, some had already discussed with their family members about it.
Half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they had discussed with their partners the cost of long-term maintenance.
Only 10 percent talk to their children about it.
"They want family members to look after them but don't take steps to discuss," said Holly Snyder, deputy president of the nationwide insurance business.
Here is the way to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You won't be able to provide a family to provide care for you if you don't tell them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as such options will be an important factor to figure out the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the expenses.
Funds for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have the money.
Finish your legal documents: Finish the legal war at a time.
Set a health care representative in place so that you can appoint individuals you trust to supervise your health care and ensure professionals are in your favor if you can't communicate.
Also consider the power of attorney for your finances.
You'll choose a person you trust to make decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you can't afford it.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Describe these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the money, but who's the doctor?" asked Martin.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami hitting the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to rise.
In the absence of a communication system, authorities were unable to obtain information from the government of Donggala, the northern region of Palu close to the epicenter with a magnitude 7.5 quake.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating its 40th anniversary in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala government area 300 km (180 miles) on the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The government area, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and livestock became the economic backbone of Central Sulawesi region, especially in Donggala waters.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but is concentrated only in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by Tsumani several times in 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is seismicly located in the Pacific Fire Circle and is always hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western region of Acheh, Indonesia north of Sumatra, on Dec 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on Nias Island on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Kota Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, in Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A moderate earthquake hits the Pidie Jaya government area of Acheh, causing destruction and panic, reminiscent of the devastating events of the 2004 earthquake and Tsumnami.
No tsunami was triggered at the time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the building.
2018: A powerful earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly in parts of the north of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded temporarily.
Sarah Palin's daughter arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was detained, suspected of carrying out domestic attacks, disrupting reports of domestic violence crimes and against detention, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, when a female friend tried to make a police call to report the criminal charges, she took the phone from the woman.
Palin was remanded at Mat-Su's pre-speech facility and detained on unsecured bonds amounting to <0x24>500, KTUU reported.
He was brought before a court on Saturday, where he had confessed "certainly, not guilty" when asked about the confession, the network reported.
Palin faces three minor Class A offences, meaning he may be jailed for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He has also been charged under a small Class B offence, can be sentenced to a day in prison and fined as much as <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time a criminal charge has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, the youth was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the allegations of the attack.
The case was filed in the Alaska Military Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, interfering with reports of domestic violence crimes and possessing a gun in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend accused the man of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran military group in 2016 after linking her son's violent actions to PTSD following his services in Iraq.
Tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks were also affected, with the death toll expected to rise in the next day.
Earth Gepa struck outside Tangah Sulawesi located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulated on social media show the timing of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach celebrating a party in the city of Palu during the tsunami hit the beach.
Prosecutor demands extrajudicial death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
New York prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the New York City suspect of a terror attack that killed eight people - an unusual sentence that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists in his path on Oct.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors had to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" imposed serious bodily injuries, according to the notice with intent to claim the death penalty, on file in the Southern District, New York.
Both charges lead to the death penalty, according to the court's ruling.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts including eight counts of murder for illegal activities, which prosecutors often wear in organized crime cases, and one count of terrorism and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "careful planning and planning", according to prosecutors, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "virtuous, cruel and contemptible."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has long been prosecuting the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, has been charged with murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed for the New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced after they were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was sentenced to death in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, did not feel guilty on the day and month following the attack, according to court documents.
He made a statement to investigators that he was happy with what he was doing, according to the police.
Saipov said he was prompted to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on the phone, according to allegations.
He also asked to display ISIS flags in hospital rooms, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal advocates representing Saipov, said they were "really disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We feel the decision to demand the death penalty as opposed to accepting a guilty plea for life imprisonment with no possibility of release, only extending the trauma of this event to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence had earlier called on the prosecutor to refrain from demanding the death penalty.
According to Tory MPs, Nigel Farage should be responsible for conducting Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during protests at the Tory conference.
The former head of Ukip said politicians should "feel a sham" of "Eurosceptics" - because one of the MPs, Theresa May, recommended she should be given the responsibility of handling negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the parade in Birmingham that the UK "will be out now" if Farage becomes Brexit secretary.
But the challenge faced by May was to resolve the split between members who supported the Tories who participated in the protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is working to ensure the Chequers tolerance plan remains in place amid attacks from Brexiteer, Remain and the EU.
May's allies insisted on negotiations with Brussels despite the impact - and the Eurosceptic and Labour powers to choose between her package or 'chaos'.
Bone told the outgoing rally that it was meant to be out at Solihull who wanted to throw away the chequers.
He recommended that Farage be made aristocratic and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been given that responsibility, we would have gone out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit but we must throw out the Chequers."
Setting a protest against the EU, he said: "We are not fighting in a world war to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that British people have changed their minds and want to remain completely untrue."
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns, who also attended the parade, told reporters: "I just said: Prime Minister, listen to the people's voice.
"Chequers are not popular among the public, the Opposition will not vote in favor, it is not popular in our party and the activists who are on the streets and who have voted for us.
Please drop the chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The prime minister will continue to hold their posts if they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians need to "feel the sting" if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is the belief between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them 'we're not going to let them escape by doing so.'
In a message to an enthusiastic audience he added: "I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel its sting.
“We are preparing for the people’s army that gave us victory in Bexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom independent, self-governing, proud.”
Meanwhile, Remainer marched through Birmingham before holding a rally in the middle of the city.
A group of activists flew banners of the Tories Against Brexit after the group's launch at the end of the week.
Peer Labour Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives about the security issues they faced with party applications as the conference began.
"They said they could put IT systems in place and all technology with Canada and so on, for borders without contradictions, for trade without borders," he added.
"It's all a joke.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren intends to "study" for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "study to run for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat presented his future plans during a ‘town hall' in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November with GOP Rep candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts Trump campaign.
He is expected to compete with Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters using the ‘town hall’ format since Trump took office.
One participant asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied it was time "for women to Washington to repair the broken kingdom, and this included a woman on the top ladder."
Captures made in the Sims shooting death from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect had been detained in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the detention of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde acted in defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, had a gun and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was detained without incident and placed under the detention of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot 6-foot junior raised in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears world championship gap as teams order him to win, defeating Sebastian Vettel
"It was clear at the time, Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday," the Mercedes team's direction played an important role in the race.
From the start of the compartment, Bottas started well, almost beating Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel got into the pit first and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, something that was supposed to be final.
Mercedes then went into the pits on the next lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tyre action to the tyre that left the Ferrari driver free inside at risk to defend himself after the act of defending the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back grid and came in seventh place after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead for most of the race and did not change tires to target a quick finish and bypassed Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He went into the pits in the 44th round but was unable to improve speed for the next eight rounds when Raikkonen was in fourth place.
It was a difficult day for Valtteri who had made a good race over the weekend and whose gentleman nature allowed me to bypass.
The team has done a good job of winning first and second place," Hamilton said.
That's a bad language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday at the insistence of women he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not give a direct answer to the testimony given before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what happened in the Senate was "cruel and ugly and a liar."
"One thing can happen and a beautiful thing happened a few days ago in the Senate, when you look at anger, when you look at people who are angry and cruel and ugly and liars," he said.
"When you look at the exposures and leaks and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaking."
Okay, wait a minute.
Are we leaking...No, we are not leaking," he added, making the senator's facial expression.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugholeh Ford in July, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's allegations, I'm not leaking his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He told me to keep it as difficult and I kept it as difficult as asked."
But the woman's denial was disliked by the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "I tell you, that's an unpleasant language of motion.
Maybe he didn't do that, but it's the worst language of movement I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court candidate, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the allegations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see, atrocities, atrocity, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrifice to gain power and control," Mediaite reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored a goal for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee star made amends for Friday's Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 return match at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with a two-goal win via a blow from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie relegated the hosts before Dwyer recovered the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard equalised points for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed a win for them.
This is the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's side, who came from the bottom to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The opening for Dwyer arrived in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford providing help while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
With what looked like a busy opening time, Sullivan raised the hosts' eye at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became an assistant to Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants won the game during the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first time.
The hosts then regrouped and Bouchard again equalised by scoring at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen give Dundee a first win in a late match in the second and he secured the win with a fifth team in the middle of the final.
The Giants, who have lost four of their five matches at home, Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controllers Killed to Ensure Hundreds on Earthquake
The Air Traffic Controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died after ensuring that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers managed to take off.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong tremors continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his escape, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan refused to leave his control at the powerful control tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport in Palu.
He did not step in to ensure that Aircraft 6321 Batik, which was on track at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt the tower was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost it this morning before the helicopter could get to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken listening to this news," he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The number of deaths is still rising as many bodies are still under the rubble and many cannot be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The 6-meter-high surge destroyed the Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings the body back.
Clean water is difficult to obtain.
Small shops are remodelled everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross organisations are rushing to provide assistance to survivors but we don't know what will be found there.
It's a tragedy, but things can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete any evacuation-related tasks.
You ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says a passenger is missing after plane crashes
The airline, which operates the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, said a passenger was missing after it said all 47 passengers and crew were safely removed from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a broadcast that since Saturday afternoon, the company has been unsure of the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
The local boat helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water during an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the actual sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. airline and Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses felt the plane was missing from the runway.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane entered the runway low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to cross the waist-high water to the emergency gates of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he only had minor injuries to the head.
The U.S. Navy said the crew at the restored docks were also providing assistance using a re-inflatable boat to move passengers to the coast before the plane sank into 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network says 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered aircraft crashes in the past two decades, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analysts give women's night timeline burned alive
Prosecutors restarted the case Saturday in a re-arrangement of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligent analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used mobile phone records to organize the movement of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he was killed.
Rowlett said she received some location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, contradicting previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his cell phone along with Chambers' phone as he claimed to be along with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood in front of the court and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, that he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he had "cheated because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Trellis said she knew Chambers two weeks before the woman's death.
Mobile phone records show that they know each other for only a week.
Rowlett said after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted Chamber's text and contact information from his phone.
"He's erased the woman from his life," Hale said.
Lawyers are scheduled to begin the closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be before the jury later that evening.
The High Breed: Is Hip Hop Sensitive?
The hip hop trio want to change the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop has changed far from its original purpose, namely political messages and solving social problems.
They want to go back to the base and make hip hop feel popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen recent revivals in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York's nanny sues a couple who fired her for texting "racist"
New York caregivers sued the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text that was wrongly sent to a mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple denied they were racists, equating the lawsuit's actions to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she learned that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day of 2016.
"I'm no longer black," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the text.
She wanted to send the text to her husband, instead she sent the message to Maurice, twice.
Aware of his guilt, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "uncomfortable," fired Maurice, saying that his previous nanny, an African-American, was not doing a good job and that he expected the presence of a nanny from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a working day and sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, and demands compensation in <0x24>350 a day for six months, the housing damages he has offered, without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't have done that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to allegations of racism, saying the act of terminating Maurice's services was appropriate because they felt the woman could not be trusted after offending the woman.
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
"But will you put your child's care on someone you've been rude to, even if it's a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
No, I don't."
Equating the lawsuit as a “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had just two months of childbirth and was in “a difficult situation.”
“You want to wear someone in that situation?
It's not a good thing," added the banker.
During the case, public opinion courts quickly condemned the couple on social media, attacking them against their actions and logic.
Paddington publishers worry readers will find it difficult to relate to talking bears, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of the person who reads the book first before the book is published.
"It's very sad to know about Paddington's success."
He said his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before inspiring to write a children's book, a little toy bear, felt optimistic about his work being rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweet bittersweet" after his father's death last year.
About Paddington, he described as "the most important member of our family," he added, his father was proud of his success in the end.
"My father was a quiet man, he wasn't a big talker," he said.
"But, because Paddington is too alive for him, it's like feeling you have a child who achieves something that you're proud of even though it's not who you made it.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although the bear was his invention and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My son is dying and I need to say goodbye on the phone.
Upon landing, the daughter was sent to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice in a hurry where doctors had worked hard to save her life.
"Nad called me frequently to say that the situation was bad and he would not be saved," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, baby.
I'll be by your side soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication given by the doctor to pump her heart slowly came out and left her system.
He died before his time and it was all turned off.
I just sat there and waited, knowing this was going to happen.
I can't yell or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her son, boarded an airplane with other passengers - who did not know about the bitter experience she had.
"No one knows," he said.
“I lowered my head, and tears flowed down at all times.
It’s hard to describe, but on this journey I felt sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.”
Woman sends postcards to avoid suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one who committed suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a letter on the Welsh bridge with an inspirational message and a phone number to call for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any mother to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a potential cook with infectious smiles.
“Everyone knows him by his smile.
They always say his smile can turn on any room."
However, he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother met his brother after he committed suicide.
Davis said: "I'm worried that this will continue to cause the effects of other things to happen."
Davis invented the card, "to inform people that there are people you can meet and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit in silence - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
"He didn't tell me that he felt sad or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in her attitude.
He is very sad on Christmas Day - When children open their gifts, he does not look at them or anything."
He said the death of his partner was a major trauma to them, but they were forced to pass it: "It made a huge hole in the family.
It divides us.
But we have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs as the FBI begins investigation
"I think if we can get what he wants - a time-limited investigation, a limited scope - we can lead to unity," Flake said on Sunday, adding that the committee was "a mess" in a stalemate based on rooted beliefs.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their displeasure is due to timeliness.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, and on November 6 - if Republican results are unsatisfactory, they will grow weaker to get the person they want to nominate for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush had made a call to the Senator, lobbying them in support of Kavanaugh, who had worked at the White House for Bush and through Bush had met his wife Ashley, who became Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI file a report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats convene.
It is unclear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate seat, which will allow Mike Pence, the deputy president, to equalise the draw and confirm his position in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to South Korea's legislature.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by people smugglers were a major factor.
Pyongyang did not provide any public comment.
Most of the North Korean defectors will be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the DMZ between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal immigrants not political refugees and often deports them forcibly.
Relations between the North and the South - technically still at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on talks on delayed nuclear disarmament.
This comes after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in a general sense to head towards nuclear-freedom on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US sanctions of slowing the development of talks since the events.
"Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not guaranteed and therefore, we will not begin nuclear disarmament first," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "emotional," and it was inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "emotionally" and said his disposition was inappropriate to hold office in Mahlama Agong.
Pelosi made the following review in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe that if a woman behaves like that, they will say she is 'emotional,'" Pelosi said of the reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening remarks, Kavanaugh was emotional, sometimes almost screaming and crying when discussing family and while in high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "extremely and well-organized defamation" managed by liberals still angry Hilary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that she was not eligible to hold office in the Supreme Court, as it showed that she was biased against Democrats.
"I feel he has disqualified himself and his actions against the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to prosecute Kavanaugh if she was confirmed, and if Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this - if he didn't tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he wouldn't be eligible to hold office in the Supreme Court, but only in the court he is now in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was worried about Kavanaugh's decision to Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as she was perceived as a conservative court.
In the verification hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering whether he would change the Supreme Court's decision.
"This is not the time for an emotional, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'What fun,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to show it.
It was a natural insult, an inflammation that was months and years plentiful, and he did not hold back his anger without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything special, do you?"
She continued, "I was helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who said she also cried when angry, but had invented a technique, if she felt angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he continued.
And I think that's a wise suggestion."
Crying is allowed as a way to channel anger because it is always misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of an old job, in a male-dominated office, I found I was crying with a notice of insurmountable anger, I was pulled by an older woman on the neck - a cold manager I was terrified of - pulling me into the staircase.
"Don't show them your tears," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to make you sad."
Patricia Schroeder, a former congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during her presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an affair in a boat called Monkey Business out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, felt there was no reason to prevent her from joining the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a carefully planned decision," he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates and they don't need another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Due to the events that took place at the end of the campaign, the woman was left behind in an attempt to set up a tube, and she vowed not to compete until she earned <0x24>2 million.
It was a futile struggle.
He found his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 to a man would give him only <0x24>250.
"Do they feel I can get a discount?" he said.
When he said that he would not launch a formal campaign, he felt a variety of feelings - grateful to those who supported him, frustrated by the system that made it difficult for him to ask for donations and target non-candidate voters, and angry at sexism - and he felt shot.
"You'd think I had a broken heart," Schroeder recalled of how the media reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember when I thought about it, what would it put on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
The U.S.-China Trade War May Benefit Beijing
The start of the trade war between the US and China may be confusing, and although the fighting is not yet over, the dispute between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year with taxes on Chinese exports including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
The most significant increase was this week with new tariffs affecting <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in item value, with effects such as taxing on half of the goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing retaliated in the same manner each time, most recently, imposed a five to ten percent tariff on 60 billion American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the U.S. each for action, and the world's second-largest economy is not impressed.
To make Washington retreat would mean bowing to the U.S. will, but submitting to the U.S. public is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
According to experts, if Beijing plays the cards correctly, U.S. Trade War pressures can positively support China in the long run by lowering the interdependence between the two countries.
"The rapid political decision by either Washington or Beijing could initiate an uncontrolled economic situation in any country and appear to be more dangerous than what observers have previously understood," said Abigail Grace, a research fellow focusing on Asia at the Center for the Safety of New America, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of political refugees, says foreign minister
Syria said the country was prepared for a voluntary return of the country's political refugees and called for help to rebuild the country devastated by the seven-year war.
Speaking at the U.N. Supreme Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made to combat terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to restore areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normal conditions.
The situation is now ready for the voluntary return of refugees, to countries they have been forced to leave due to violence and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to develop the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that support the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. Team with a final point of 16.5, 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive European titles and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team got the 14.5 matches needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, struggling throughout the match, unleashed a tee blow into the water at the par-3 hole 16, giving up defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfers excelled in all rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players to 5-0-0 since the competition format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was pulled out at 5<0x26>4 by the lowest-placed player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, dropped to 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may have played last time for the Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup veteran Spanish player Sergio Garcia became Europe's all-time winner with a peak of 25.5 points.
“I rarely cry but can’t hold back today.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful that Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm so happy, I'm happy to get my cup back.
This is for the team, and I'm happy to be able to help," Garcia said after a European victory.
He has handed over the task to John Ram who has beaten the U.S. legend Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I feel proud that when I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all competitions in France and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup work record.
Strange statistics by one of the greatest players, winning 14 major championships second place only on Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team struggled all weekend to find a track, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good golf game throughout the match.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance from his team, "I'm proud of them, they're working hard.
This morning, we gave the European team a chance.
We tried our best.
Congratulations, Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee and we're going forward.
I love all these guys and am proud to be a captain.
You need to lift the hat.
We have been defeated."
