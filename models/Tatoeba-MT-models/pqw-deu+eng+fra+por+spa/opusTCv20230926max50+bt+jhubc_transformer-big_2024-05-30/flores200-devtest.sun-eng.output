Martelly signed the Interim Elections Council (CEP) which numbered nine people in the language of yesterday.
This is the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month the presidential commission recommended the CEP's resignation earlier as part of a package of actions to promote the country in the new elections.
The Commission is Martelly's response to anti-regime protests that spread in October.
Protests that have sometimes been stifled by violence were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of them since 2011.

Nextgen is a system that the FAA claims will be able to fly airships on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of chaos each year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technologies that are opposed to older ground-based radar technologies to manage air traffic to show clearer aircraft positions and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no more vehicles installed with high-ground trains that will not stop at Wembley, so parking and rides are not available on the ground.
The fear of a lack of vehicle increases the likelihood that the game will be forced to close without the support of the team's supporters.
The results of a study published Thursday in the Journal of Science report the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden report a new species evolving in just two generations, although this process is time-consuming, due to breeding between the endemic Darwinian Finch, Geospiza forte, and the Immigrant Finch cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all shapes. It can also be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can be twisted and knitted. It can be hammered or rolled onto the sheet.
it can be made thinner, then stick to other metals. It can be made thinner it can almost be used for the decoration of drawings painted by hand in books or called "iluminated manuscripts"
This is called chemical pH. You can make a pointer with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) its chemicals are.
Its pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that release their electrons (because the hydrogen atom is derived from a proton and an electron).
Stir the two dry powders together then, with clean but wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel good and form a small shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have flushed toilets in almost every home, which are connected to an advanced sewage system.
The remains of the sewage system have been found in the mounds of the cities of Minoa in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were found in ancient Egyptian, Persian and Chinese civilizations. In Roman Civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were placed in the same place.
When you're in contact with a distant person, you're using a satellite.
The satellite received the call and returned it to the ground very quickly.
The satellite was sent to space by rocket. Scientists use a telescope in space because the Earth's atmosphere changes part of our light and view.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet to be placed on a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheels have changed the world in an incredible way. The biggest thing that the wheels do and we are making transportation to be cheaper and shorter.
This has led us to find trains, cars, and a lot of other transportation.
Below it is a medium-sized cat that eats during medium sizes ranging from rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including pet cats) are breeding more small animals costing pets, mice, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job owned by cats almost avoiding competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in a large group called pride.
Prides range from one to three adult males, with about thirty females and their young.
Women usually have a close relationship with others, in the form of a large family of sisters and daughters.
The pride of a lion is not very different from that of a herd of wolves or dogs, animals similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in their behavior, and is very dangerous for their time.
An athlete who has a strong sense of urgency, who is able to climb up (though not well), jumps a long distance and attracts the strength of a person who is about five times as strong.
The lion, the leopard, and the jaguar were the only four cats that could frighten.
The lion's mouth is not as big as a lion's mouth, but rather as a lion's mouth.
Ocelots like to prey on small animals. They will eat monkeys, snakes, monsters and birds if they can. Almost all animals eaten by ocelots are smaller than their size.
Scientists think that the ocelot hunts another animal for food by its instincts, leaving the ground where the other animal once passed.
It can be dark in the daytime with a nocturnal view, and it can also be very slow. The ocelot hunts in time by blending into the surroundings and then catching the time.
When a small group of living things (small populations) are separated from the population primarily from their origin (such as moving across mountains or rivers, or if moving to a new island so as not to return easily) they will often find themselves in different neighborhoods from before.
This immediate environment has different raw materials with different enemies, so the population that quickly needs different features or adapts to be a stronger competitor than the old ones
The original population will not change the same once, it will still need the same adaptation as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to get used to new environments, they begin to look like they will continue to decrease like other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, 2 populations will be seen to be so different that it cannot be beat in the same species.
This process is what we call the speciation which means the formation of new species. The speciation is an inevitable consequence and the most important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is inhaled by humans, and they take in carbon dioxide that is released by humans (i.e., humans exhale).
Plants process the process with the help of sunlight to pass photosynthesis. Plants also thrive.
We build houses and wear clothes from plants. Almost all the food we eat from plants is also. Without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the main predator of his time, he was not afraid of anything, except for the other Mossaurus.
It has a length of more than 70 sharp blades, and an additional set on the roof of its mouth, which means there is no way out for anything that crosses its path.
We do not know for sure, but we may think that the tongue is branched, which includes turtles, large fish, other mesasauruses, and possibly cannibals.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even dinosaurs such as T. rex were no match.
Although most of their food was so good for us, the Romans had food in strange or unusual celebrations, including new ones, peacocks, squirrels, and ravenous animals.
It is different when it is the poor and the ladies eating and sitting on the chairs, the rich like to make a feast together on them will lie down at meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include food that reached Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, coconuts, and no ancient Romans had tried turkey.
The Babylonians built the main temple for each god and considered it their home.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and a place where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes some towers have a pyramid-like shape, called ziggurats. ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special place for the Lord.
In the warm climate in the Middle East, home is not important to them.
Most of the Hebrew family's life took place in an open space.
The wife cooks in the courtyard; the shops are only counters that turn to the street. The stone is used to build houses.
In the past, there was no clear forest in the land of Canaan, so the price of timber was very high.
Greenland has nothing to do with it. In the Nordic story they forgive that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, then while traveling west, found Greenland and then gave it the name Greenland.
But in addition to his discovery, the tribe of Eskimo has been living in the area since then.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences between peoples, kings, customs and history from Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the National Treasure movie, you might think that there's a treasure map behind the Declaration of Independence.
Well, it's not true. Although there is a note on the part of the documentator, it's not a treasure map.
In the back section of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776". The text appears under the document, in reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of his life, large parchment documents (size 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) have been rolled out to be postponed.
So, it seems that the notation was added just as a labyrinth.
D-Day landings and battles did not succeed in liberating the northern part of France, but the southern part was not yet.
Ordered by the French "Vichy". They were French people who had peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, calling it Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks the Americans and the French Liberation Forces liberated southern France and they returned to Germany.
Paradigm is a culture that belongs to a group of people who live and work together, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civic meaning, related to the Latin civis word, meaning citizens, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and not how it can be interpreted as much of the society in which it belongs.
The state-states were the forerunners of the nation. The culture of civilizations wrote down the continuation of prosperity for generations, the cultural sites that remained and the fair spread.
Minor cultures often perish without leaving associated historical evidence and failing to be recognized as worthy civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen states formed the first weak central government - with Congress being the only component - of the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to impose taxes, and because there is no national or judicial execution, it depends on the state authorities, who are often uncooperative, to impose any of their actions.
It also has no power to get out of the interstate tax and fees rules.
The articles require absolute approval from all states before they can be replaced and the states sometimes consider the central government to be their representatives often absent.
Italy's national team, and Germany's national team are the two most successful national teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Famous sports are baseball, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, bicycle racing, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern region, and Italy participates in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the grouping/group of islands in Japan, Japan is often referred to, in its geographical position, as "islands."
The origin of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passed by and recorded the island's name as Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East Indies established a headquarters in southwestern Taiwan, which began changing indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese workers to make plantations with sugar.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan to be one of the provinces of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Solar Temple, and the 3 Window Space.
Many of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better picture of what the original looks like.
Since 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu has been heavily donated and continues to be refurbished to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is that it measures 35 mm. It is the size of a dominant film that is very similar to the analogue film era.
This is still being made clear today, but the most important aspect of the ratio has been inherited from the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, due to the width of 36mm at 24mm.
The ratio aspect of this form (divided into twelve nearly the simplest rounded number ratio) is that of 3:2.
Many common formats (such as APS and friends formats) are similar or similar to these aspect ratios.
Rules that are extremely abusive and often ridiculed are simple guidelines for creating dynamism while maintaining the size in the image.
It states that this is the best place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into three vertical and horizontal sections (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which has been rich and powerful, was closely watched.
For more than a thousand years Christians have bound European countries despite their language and customs.
The whole of the world was filled with people from the king to the people.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's finances are there for that reason.
The central authority of the church was centered in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and meaning led to many questions about this teaching.
After the end of the war, the British declared the German naval blockade.
The strategy proved effective, reducing important military and civilian provisions, despite its blockade of international law which was generally accepted by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain applied mines to its seas to prevent other ships from entering its territory, which could lead to destruction as well as for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response by this tactic, the Germans expected the same response to the unrestricted submarine war.
In the 1920s, the attitude still practiced by many citizens was the attitude of pacifism and self-isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to prevent such a situation as well as the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the U.S. only taking 4 sen, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (above him in his earlier work) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing the period of time, each stage of China or every ruling family was a different dynasty.
Each dynasty was also an instable period divided by several provinces. Its most famous period was the Age of the Three Kingdoms which lasted for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During this period a fierce war broke out between the nobles to usurp the throne.
The Three Kingdoms are one of the most bloodshed shames in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died to sit in the uppermost seats of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single leader.
Also after the Colonisation of the Revolution is open to all male applicants who allow the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true for the military because instead of ranks sorted from the current class are being measured according to their ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very fond of all the things that are unusual in earthly life. He often confided in a cave that is now called the "Heaven" on the mountain "Noor" (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which survived from time to time, gives a picture of the spiritual direction of Muhammad.
Located on one of the northernmost mountain peaks of Mecca, this cave is very isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find a lot even though there's 1 that knows about it. Once inside the cave, it's completely alienated.
Nothing can be seen other than the clear and beautiful sky above and many mountains around it. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many other large pyramid buildings ever built in honor of the deceased Pharaoh.
The flat ground of Giza, also known as the "Giza Necropolis" inside the Egyptian Graveyard, is filled with pyramids (which are the largest) of the small tombstones, temples, and the Sphinx.
Large pyramids were built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
Arrow symbols" such as the letter V and "lower arrows" such as stacks or squares that have lost the lower side.
High means you should start at the end and push the bow, and to the bottom means you should start at the bottom (where your hand is holding the bow) and then pull the bow.
A high-pitched sound usually produces a softer sound when a low-pitched one produces an attractive sound.
If you're going to draw your own characteristics, but remember, the curved features that have been printed are there because of the music, so it's usually worth it to be appreciated.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, his two young children (aged 11 Marie Therese and 4-year Louis-Charles) and the king's younger sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 during a woman's market.
On the train, he made a trip back to Paris surrounded by a mob of men and threatened the King and Queen.
The king and the queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, one of the members of the mob saw the heads of the royal guards who were killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The cost of U.S. imperialism when the Philippines was conquered was paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes and to the U.S. colonial regime to finance a large portion of the spending and interest on bonds floating above the Philippine government's name through banks in Wall Street.
Of course, the super benefits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic benefits for U.S. imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to first understand the contexts that support the creation of the order.
The period of these events is commonly called the Upper Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Upper Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and continued by the Late Middle Ages, which is based on the discovery of the end of around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses several ideas in practice, ranging from the concealment of technology or technology and the strong feeling that human destiny is driven by basic logic related to scientific law and its existence in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have 2 general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a largely culturally or politically influenced path, and that technology in its turn has a "effect" on the masses that is always, rather than socially prevalent.
For example, a person might say that a car is going to go to a road development.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for some cars alone, so a new method of production was developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car owners also caused higher accidents in road accidents, this led to the discovery of new techniques in health care to repair the damaged car body.
Romanticism has a broad cultural element of determinism, portrayed by writers such as Goethe, Fischte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography forms the individual. While over time the customs and cultures associated with this geography arise, then everything mentioned above corresponds to the place of society, much better than the laws that are carried out from place to place.
Paris is known as the fashion capital for contemporary fashion, Constantinople is regarded as the fashion capital for European feudalism.
It is famous for being a luxurious center starting around 400 AD lasting until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusades had returned with prizes such as silk and spices that were valued far more than the Byzantine market offered.
It's time to move the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris.
Its gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries.
Initially the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to its slow communication channels, the style that exists in the west can be overlooked for 25 to 30 years.
Faced with the end of the Predominant Century, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments was that people began to use buttons so as to speed up at its peak.
Subsistent harvesting is a farm that is carried out to produce enough food to meet the basic needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistent farming is a simple, often organic system, which uses natively stored seedlings of an ecoregion combined with rotation of crops or relatively simple techniques to maximize harvesting.
The history of farming is largely a work of living and it is still widely practiced in developing countries.
The subculture promotes people who like to think that they feel ignored by society's standards and allow a sense of self.
The subculture is distinguished depending on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.
The quality that defines a subculture as the difference between language, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of the mining subculture show signs of their membership in a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes clothing, behavior, and argot.
The most common method used to describe the importance of socialization is to use some of the cases of poor children, through deliberate abuse, weakness, or violence, not socialization by adults as they grow up.
Many of these children are called "wild" or "wilderness," and many of these children are often treated badly by others (usually by their own parents); in some cases, such children are neglected because their parents do not accept the child's condition in the sense of their incomplete intellect or physical wealth.
Children have experienced trauma and abuse before leaving or fleeing.
Some of the animals are thought to have been cared for by animals; others claim to have lived in the wild alone.
When raised by other animals by a person, wild children exhibit behavior (within the physical limits) almost as completely as animals treat them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
If a project-based learning should make learning easier and interesting, building a more advanced scaffolding.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but is an aid that provides support for individuals who are experiencing new experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The framework can be virtual or real, the teacher is a skeleton form but it is the same as the small paper clamps that exist in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and is intended to ask, ask, and explain difficult procedures for students if they are working alone.
Children were placed in an orphanage for a variety of reasons, first being detained, tortured, and then subjected to sexual abuse.
There is no one who grows up in an environment that is not caring, caring, and educating, but the reality is there.
We believe that this is a safe zone for children.
Our nursing system should provide a safe home, loving care, stable education, and reliable health care.
In the orphanage must provide everything that is less than the earth before I can get it.
The Internet combines the two elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The different features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and gratification.
For example, "taught" and "socialization" are suggested to be important motivations for using the internet (James and others., 1995).
The involvement of people" with "the basic relationship" is considered to be something that inspires Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examine how we react to the website.
The use of video recordings has resulted in important discoveries in the interpretation of small expressions, facial movements that are only visible in a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that you can know whether or not the person is complaining by expressing his or her true facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his letter to the Presidential Speech, describes how a person who can't understand speech because his brain is disturbed can judge the sincerity of the person who speaks.
He even suggested that such an ability in interpreting human behavior could be possessed by animals such as pet dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: those that conceal and emerge.
A mutation is the addition of a new type of genetics, and then the selection removes it from the collection of the type indicated.
Segregation and re-arranged combinations are interchangeable between two groups with each generation.
When out of the field, it will be difficult for monkeys whose digestion is almost the same as that of people to meet the amino acid needs of the existing fertilizer resources.
In addition, failing to do so is a serious reward: starting with depression, lack of pleasure, and then eventually dying.
The most accessible plant sources are proteins that can be accessed by leaves and nuts, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are hard on pegs.
Animals (eggs, eggs) do not digest, but they also supply a lot of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
If we were to take a look at all the rupees, we should not be surprised once we know that our ancestors are eating protein in a way that is quite similar to how chimpanzees are in their savannas.
Sleep disorders are the deliberate process of waking up during your normal sleep period and getting back to sleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
It's easy to do with a quiet alarm clock to awaken your consciousness without really waking up.
If you reset the clock when you sleep, the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, it will force you out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorythm-based option is to drink a lot of water (water or water, which makes it difficult to sleep), forcing 1 person to wake up to sleep.
The amount of inner peace a person has is the opposite of the amount of stress in the body and soul.
The more lower the stress level, the more positive life. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and happiness.
All can get enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is stress and our own bad thoughts.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddhism, but is supplemented by Mahayana love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, the Tibetan Buddhist tradition is very simple. It incorporates Kundalini Yoga, tapa, and the path of love that embraces all.
And Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is created through yoga movements, breathing exercises, spells and visualization.
The center of the Tibetan tapa is Yoga God. Through the visualization of various gods, energy channels are cleared, the chakra is activated and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War 2, which was working in cooperation between the Soviet Union and the US. With the end of the system's phase war, the process and culture caused the countries to fall.
With the end of the war, the former allies are now enemies and the Cold War has begun.
It is expected to last for the next 40 years and will be fought in real terms, by proxy forces, on the battlefield from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, Polish defences were destroyed. The only hope was to retreat and reorganize the defences on Roman bridges.
However, this plan became obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian troops after attacking eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggregation Treaty and other international treaties, bilateral and multilateral.
Using a ship to transport goods during this period is the most efficient way to move many people and goods across the ocean.
The main objective of the navy is to ensure that the state maintains the ability to move large numbers of people and goods, while at the same time, it must interfere with the ability of others to transfer large numbers of people and goods.
One important example to remember is the North Atlantic campaign about World War II. The Americans tried to move people and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, German naval forces, often using U-boats, to stop this ocean.
If the Allies failed, the Germans could have conquered the United Kingdom as well as conquered the whole of Europe.

The wagonway was built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagon is only made from wooden boards that are parallel to the hunchback, it will be able to make the horse to move faster and pull a heavier load than on the fart road.
Crossties were introduced sufficiently early to hold tracks in place. However, gradually it is realized that the track will be more efficient if there is iron on top.
This is not a common practice, but iron is causing more damage to the wooden wheels of the cart.
Finally, wooden clasps were replaced by iron clasps. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known transportation was that people began to pay regularly for 2 million years in the past with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning people who are constantly on the plate).
Formerly, Australopithecus did not walk as straight as usual.
Two-foot specializations have been found in the fossils of Australopithecus ramo 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have lived with 2 feet since its inception in 7 million years ago.
We can start a more environmentally friendly life, we can join an environmentally friendly movement, and then we can even be environmentally friendly defenders to reduce future adversity at some level.
This is like a symptom treatment in all things, but, if we know only a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem, and then we need to get rid of it.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the advancement of human science and technology, and the problem becomes even greater due to the large number of populations and lifestyles that waste humanity.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, the handwritten design was signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and sent several blocks to the printing shop John Dunlap.
That night, 150 to 200 sheets were made, which is now known as the "Dunlop Spread".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon at the American Independence Building on July 8th.
1 man was sent to George Washington on July 6th read to his troops in New York on July 9th. Copies up to London on August 10.
25 The famous Dunlap remains the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original handwritten copy was not saved.
Many servants of today's paleontology believe that 1 group of dinosaurs survived and are alive to this day. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider birds to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there's a lot about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They had a squirrel and a coyote, and they went to the other two legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on information manipulation encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers have only 1 out of 2 ratings, which is 0 or 1, and they are called binary digits - or bits, for use with computer jargon.
Internal poisoning cannot be directly seen. Symptoms, such as uterus, are so common that a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of intravenous poisoning is the presence of an open drug container filled with toxic drugs or household chemicals.
Check the label for the first aid command for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by insects to describe this type of insect.
The term originated in ancient times with ticks, where it was highly adaptable and became a human parasite.
Both the killer lice and the same hazardous lice, can adapt to living in the nest and the place of origin of the host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common sexually transmitted disease in adults and elderly people.

The main goal of science is to discover how the world works in a scientific way.
It is not alone, experiment, and experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations and also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the science of Greece diminished, Westerners felt disconnected from Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many who do rhythmic research in physiology and behavior very often rely on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The periodic rhythm, which does not respond only to the periodic offers of jabi, is noted for most living things, including bacteria, elevations, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is an independent oscillator that will continue the period of the free cycle even if there are no external signs.
The Hershey and Chase experiment reveals why DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to insert their DNA into bacteria.
They tried two experiments that marked DNA in a phage containing radioactive phosphorus or protein from a phage containing radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have several different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected and whether the cells affected by other cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to the child, while mutations elsewhere can cause the cell to die or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying natural scenery, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in the area are hunting, fishing, bird watching, and visiting the park and then learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visit, take pictures, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to work and kill other people whose purpose is to work where he has just left.
In this dynamic transportation is that everyone can connect, and support, a transportation system based on a private car.
Today's science shows that this massive carbon economy has eclipsed biosphere from 1 stable country that supported human evolution in the past 2 million years.
All members of the public and using public transportation equipment. Almost all people complain about the transportation system
In developed countries you rarely hear the same humane outbursts about the quality of water or bridges that collapse.
Is the transportation system raising such complaints, why fail every day? Is transportation engineer just incompetent? Or is there a more basic event?
Traffic flow is the study of individual movements and vehicles between 2 points and the interaction of relationships 1 with the other.
Unfortunately, learning the traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of the learners is unpredictable at 1% capacity.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave fairly consistently; meanwhile, traffic flow tends to have a reasonable and rough consistency that can be described mathematically.
To better describe the current, the relationship has been made in three main characteristics: (1) the current, (2) the density, and (3) the velocity.
This relationship helps in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects are the first animals to fly. The ability to fly helps them stay away from enemies and find food easier, and more efficient to feed.
Insects have many advantages in the ability to overwhelm their legs throughout the body.
This gave them a place to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that can't keep their wings up are the bears and the bears.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolved around the sun.
Some people think he is right but many believe the opposite; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
That's because the earth doesn't move, right?

All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
It is well known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, because they can be found in nature and are easily calculated to be mined using ancient tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, made the theory that all were composed by a combination of one or more of four elements.
It is more similar to the 4 conditions of the body (in the same order): solid, encable, air, and plasma, although he states that the shape can be changed to different from what I see today.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more types of metals. Do not forget there are many elements within the periodic table of elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium fall into the metal category. Of course, there are still metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain non-metallic elements such as carbon.

Atoms are very small. They are small, one trillion atoms, equal in size to the point mark at the end of this sentence.
In this way, pencils are a good choice for everyone.
Sadly, there is a new way of writing, the status and usefulness of the patches are getting worse.
People are now writing messages on a computer screen, not having to get close to the searcher.
No one knows what will happen when a new one arrives.
Fission bombs can be used based on the principle that it takes energy to unite the nuclei of many protons and neutrons.
It’s like pushing a heavy basket up a hill. Separating the core back and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus which means that they have a tendency to split with little or no thrust.

It's darker on the dark side and darker on the bright side.
There may be more maria on the near side because it is thinner. It is easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding what makes people choose or attract to them.
These theories show that people have the needs and/or desires that are desired from adolescence to adulthood.
These theories see in what certain people want to do the things they do and things around them that make them do and not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Hierarchical Theory on the Needs of Theory and 2 Hertzberg Factor Theory.
In general, 2 behaviors can appear when the manager begins to lead his co-workers. 1 end of the spectrum tries to remain "1 out of many men" (or girls).
This type of manager is experiencing difficulties in making unwanted decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating work, assigning responsibility, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, 1 person turns into an unknown person who feels he has to change everything the team does and make it his own.
After all, the leader is ultimately the one who has the most responsibility for the success or failure of the team.
This method often uses the relationship between the leader and the other team members.
The virtual team is held in accordance with the same quality standards as the conventional team, but there are few differences.
Virtual team members often have the function of being a point of contact for a physical team directly.
They have more autonomous rights than other members of the conventional team because they can take in different time zones that can't be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "magic team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, h109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
An unseen team" is a management team that each member reports. An unseen team sets standards for each member.
Why does an organization go through a process that takes time to establish a learning organization? One of the objectives to practice the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
Once all the material has been used in all departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization solving problems together can lead to new innovative processes to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation and share knowledge and insights about the organization.
Angel (2006), describes the Continuum approach as a tool that organizations use to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to cognition investigation. Then narrow the area of research and make the research more accurate.
Polar pathology's relationship with behavior hurts scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of polo damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental positions.
The emergence of new technologies has enabled me to see and explore brain structures and processes that I have never seen before.
This technology provides a wealth of information and materials to build simulation models that help us to be aware of the processes within the mind.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, it forms an important branch of computer science, matters and behavior, ways of learning and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research on AI involves creating machines to automate jobs that require human intelligence.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, ability to respond to diagnostics and subscription questions, and monitoring of handwriting, hearing and face.
Such a thing has become a separate discovery, which is specific to providing solutions to real problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and military, as they have been built into multiple home computer applications and video game software.
Field tours are a great part of any class. Often teachers like to take their students to places that use buses is not one of the options.
Technology is offering solutions and virtual work tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with the class.
Sharing field trips virtually is also a great way to day trips and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a site about their trip to the State Capital, every year this site is renovated, but the old version is on the site to make it a template paper.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with a simple grammar and learning, the presence of audiences generally changes it.
The reason students are the most critical participants, whose blogs begin to struggle to develop their writing ability to get rid of criticism.
Also blogging "developing students to become more understanding of the world around them." The need to inform the audience's interest becomes the inspiration of students to be smarter and more interesting (Toto, 2004).
Creating a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to improve their knowledge outside of regular schooling.
The usefulness of a good blog is "to be able to move students to be more analytical and critical; because they actively receive material from the internet, students are so able to define or define their position in the sense of others' not forgetful writing their opinions on other issues (Oravac, 2002).
