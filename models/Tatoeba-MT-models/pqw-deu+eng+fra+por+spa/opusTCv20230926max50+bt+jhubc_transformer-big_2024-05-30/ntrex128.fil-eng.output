Welsh Am balancing 'looks like muppets'
Some of the members of the Welsh Parliament are afraid to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is part of a plan to change the name of the assembly and make it into the Welsh Parliament.
AMs from different political backgrounds can make fun of it.
An AM from Labour, their group is concerned that "it sounds like Twp and Pwp."
For readers who are not from Wales: In Welsh, twp and tae pwp are stupid.
An AM from Plaid said that the group in general was "unhappy" and that they thought they could buy something.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open minded" to buy the name, but also said the MWP was not far from the Muppet word.
In this context, the suffix w in Welsh and u in Yorkshire English is identical.
According to the Assembly Commission, which is currently promulgating the law to change the name: "Any last resort is guilty of what Assembly Members call its own."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission discussed the results of a public consultation on the assessments that received broad support to call the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission favored the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support from the public consultation.
AMs offer potential purchases, but Presidential Officer Elin Jones may have a headache following all, hoping to create a law violation within a few weeks.
Other changes to the assembly run, including the rules for the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system, will be included in the reforms.
AMs have the last vote on what to call them when they debate the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the purchase of the country's name
There will be a debate on Sunday about whether to buy the country's name and make it "Republic of North Macedonia."
The vote will be held in a bid to resolve their decades of dilemma with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Now all the Athenians and the strangers staying there as visitors spent their time in nothing other than to say or to hear some new thing.
Macedonian leader Gjorge Ivanov, who votes for the plebiscite, will not respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have only changed their name to become part of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Silence Shuts Down as Churches in Harlem Distress
"Once upon a time, I said, there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's nothing."
He would understand the loss of bars.
"It's the interaction of people today," he said.
"It's not the town's fault the bars where people always go."
For the churches, he prays that it will not take as long as leaders expect to get the war from the sale of goods, "once they go back where they started."
In addition, they can be purchased with apartment buildings with condominiums full of people who can't help with the rest of the community's sanctuary.
"So many white people are buying condominiums in these homes," he said, "it's just a surprise that the day will come when the churches will be gone because they're going to be so far away from these churches that the people of the condominiums will be too far away."
White congregations established the same church before becoming the metropolis of the Harlem-Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation near the building took its title.
A black congregation under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shoppers at 125th Street, a major electoral street in Harlem, opposed to accepting or promoting blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but while Father Johnson's customers were making plans, they commissioned the Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, called the carillon "the marathon's wrinkles."
The great carillon player in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an inexpensive and destructive instrument."
In addition to the legendary Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, it was the first carillon in the world to be shot by a black musician named Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon on the Riverside Chruch 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
The events at St. Martin's in the last few months were a memorable account of architects and contractors, some of whom were entered by non-ordained church leaders and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the parishioner's ruler, created by non-ordained leaders - was sent to the diocese in July to "pay the expenses" of the vestry, although the vestry had nothing to do with accepting architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of equity on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old shark hunts for lobster in California
A shark attacked and attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was fishing for a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel on San Diego's KSWB-TV, half an hour later he was eating Saturday morning with his friends when he heard a young boy begging for a ride and he grabbed it with his team to separate him from the water.
Hammel, he thought it was just a bitch when the lobster recovered he heard, but "I heard the boy screaming, 'I'm bite!
I've got a bite!'
"It's been a long time," Hamlet said as he approached the boy.
"I yelled at all the water snails: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The child was hospitalized at the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego by airlift where he was listed as having a critical condition.
I'm not sure what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles at a press conference, a shark woke up in the area a few weeks ago but it was not considered a dangerous shark species.
Giles adds that the victim had mixed up with pain on the upper part of his body.
Officials have had access to the coast from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and for safety.
Giles said there were more than 135 types of sharks in the area, but it was not determined that most of them were dangerous.
Sainsbury's to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes in Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams using beauty aisles in the style of department stores with specialist assistants.
As an important part of the entry into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow as fashion and fashion trends decline, this will try to make the beauty aisle bigger in 11 stores across the country, and will increase next year if it succeeds.
Beauty investment is rising as supermarkets look for ways to fill the spaces used for TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Ani Sainsbury's doubled the size of their beauty sales with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
It also receives additional branded space for current products from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees as seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also releasing these Boutique makeup products to be in favor of vegans in what it sells - something a growing number of young buyers are looking for.
In addition, Sainsbury's retailer Fragrance Shop is set to sell at two stores, first opening in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, next year.
Online opting out and opting out of local convenience stores daily has served supermarkets to try to get people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, will make outlets more like department stores as the supermarket chain fights against discounters like Aldi and Lidl who have more services and lack of food.
Sainsbury's puts the Argos outlets in the old stores and has also entered some Habitat since they bought the same chain two years ago, which according to them has helped increase the sales of the grocery and fuel the growth of billions of companies.
The supermarket's last attempt to change their beauty and pharmacy departments has been unsuccessful.
A fight with Sainsbury's was fought with Boots in the early 2000s, but it stopped after there was an argument on how to keep the income from its chemist stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold its <0xC2><0xA3>125m pharmacy business with 281 stores in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Ani Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's: "We changed the look and date of our beauty aisle to explore the landscape for our buyers.
We also invested in colleagues who had a particular training and were willing to give a head.
Designing the whole of our brands to fill every need, and the attractive surroundings and convenient locations mean that we are the main target of the people for embellishment to achieve the ideal choice."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was outraged after TV presenter Holly Willoughby stepped down from a <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal with her lifestyle brand business to study her new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Really, their home appliance brand and accessories.
Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand has been modeled on the business of the aforementioned pair.
An Instagram spokesperson for This Morning, 37, announced her business move.
Holly Willoughby bought Dragons Den's Peter Jones for a sudden withdrawal from their growing lifestyle brand business - to study his bumper contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
According to the report, Jones was "exasperated" when the TV's golden girl admitted to a press conference on Tuesday at the headquarters of their lucrative business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that he had no time for Trust, their home appliance brand and accessories.
This business has been modeled on Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While advertising on Willoughby's Instagram, 37, his departure from Trusty, Jones flew to one of his homes in Britain.
According to one condensed information: "Right now, really is Holly's top priority.
That's just his respectful future that will hold him up for the next decade.
Everyone was pleasantly surprised by his withdrawal.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, but it's too close to being cheated.
There's a warehouse full of products at Marlow HQ ready for sale."
The company believes that the departure of one of Britain's most successful personalities, one of the company's billionaires, is a huge investment in products ranging from mattresses and candles to clothing and household appliances, and on what could become a warning sign for it.
And it could serve as the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin with three children were ten years old close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby started True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as leader in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is expected to be M<0x26>S' brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity host on ITV.
A condensed piece of information close to Jones said "We will not comment on his business dealings."
Lovely talk 'and then we're friends'
He was baffled about the criticism he received from the news media because of comments that could be called "unpresidential" and because of being very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so obsessed?
Ani Trump in his grin at the voice of the "news anchor."
"I don't have anything to hide."
He promised Kim interest in the second word after their first word in Singapore in June which Trump criticized as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But discussions of denuclearization have been delayed.
Three months after the words in June in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not seen "equivalent action" from the U.S. in their disarmament.
Instead, he promised, the U.S. would continue to push hard to maintain the ban.
Trump's reaction to the rally was more positive.
"North Korea is beautiful," he said.
"We're going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people will die.
Now, we've got a very important one."
He said, his actions have brought positive results to Kim's attention - stopping rocket tests, aiding hostages, and repatriating American soldiers' lips.
He ordered them not to tell anyone about him.
"It's too easy to look like a leader, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this scale arena, we have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to those directly in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Lindol Expect Island, Old Dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign nonvernmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has lost their homes, there is no national emergency, a preliminary measure to withdraw aid from other countries.
"On many occasions, unfortunately, they're making it clear that they don't ask for help in other countries, so it's a bit difficult," said Bb.
While the team is building Save the Children to go to Palu, it's still uncertain whether a foreigner can work in the area.
Ani G. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national team, has been looking at the situation in Palu to see if the international staff will be allowed to share in the assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that Indonesia is experiencing so often, they are not yet ready for the vibrant nature.
Although there are tsunami shelters located in Aceh, they are not generally found in other coastal areas.
The control of the tsunami warning siren in Palu, as well as the emirate, is likely to have reduced lives.
At the best of times, travel between the islands of Indonesia is very busy.
Natural vaccines have further enhanced logistics.
An optional ship stationed in Lombok to fire earthquake victims is currently heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days before the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made Indonesia's flood of infrastructure a hub in his election campaign, and has surprised him with a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration was plagued by a shortage of funds due to his imminent relocation next year.
Mr. Joko also hopes to be cut off from the unique Indonesian sects, where most Muslims embrace a more conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and thousands lost their homes as Christian and Muslim groups marched through the streets using machetes, bullets and burdens, and other dangerous attacks.
View: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool voted to face Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xherdan Shaqiri left Sturridge about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal as his team went 1-0 down.
He pointed to the left of the ball before throwing it towards the far post of goal.
The ball flew over the top of the box and pushed it over the top right corner of the net.
After that, the ball crashed into the net behind the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"It's just the right place to get the ball and players like Shaq try to move forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to figure out all the time I can," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming so I made it in a kick and I didn't think too much about it and I just turned the tile on."
Chelsea lead 1-0 in the halftime after a 25-minute lead from Belgian Eden Hazard.
In that game, the Blues striker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before he went into a band midfield and passed to Liverpool's side on the field.
Kovacic was fast-paced in midfield.
He swung a light through the ball, which brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard was able to fill the defence and sit with his left foot on a net far post just past Alisson Becker ng Liverpool.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will host Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's health ministry on Sunday.
Surprisingly, a large number of people were trapped in the caverns of the 7.5-magnitude quake on Friday that he caused waves of up to 20 volcanoes, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the staff, told a news conference.
Caves of collapsed structures spread to the city of Palu, with more than 380,000 people.
A man, 32, who was wounded and killed by a woman, was arrested by the police.
An investigation into witchcraft opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a bus was found at 7:55am at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of massacre.
The police came to them, bringing them to the place where anyone had seen or heard anything.
Ani Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan: 'I've just started an investigation but I called on anyone on John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard any reluctance to communicate with us.
I also call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who can get any dashcam footage to communicate with us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.'
A police spokesperson from Birkenhead confirmed the woman was found and she was on a land estate.
This afternoon, friends who believed they knew the woman came to ask where she found her this morning.
The investigation continues while police say they are congratulating the incident on the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lived at Grayson Mews in his flat tried to enter but the police told him that no one was supposed to enter or exit the building.
She was silent as she learned what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take a few hours before they are allowed to enter again.
A policeman was heard telling a man that the entire crime scene was determined.

Cromwell's Image of Parliament's latest stance targeted by a battle over 'historical change'
Its expulsion is a wonder of justice because of its dismantling of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its Puritan adherents.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's view as "crazy" and "planning to change history."
Ani John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "There is no escape from the current debate about the removal of statues that will be targeted by the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not order or decree the destruction of sacred images in civil dignitaries in England.
Maybe Cromwell's mistaken self-sacrifice is because of what his ancestor Thomas did in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's great work on Cromwell's 19th-century opinion and part of a study of the history of a man believed to have much more to say.
Ani G Goldsmith in The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is widely attributed, perhaps more in the 19th century than now, as a spokesman for parliament against the ban from outside, in his case of course, the monarchy.
It's still a matter of historical debate as to whether this description is accurate in general.
It is only known that the singularity in the middle of the 17th century was slowing down in the next development of our country, and Cromwell was a very intelligent man who was able to overcome an aspect of that interdependence.
It is also worth pointing out and remembering his successes as Lord Protector."
Killer Pig Slammed into Chinese Cultivation
A farmer attacked and killed a pig in a south-western Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, known only by his surname "Yuan," who was dead and had a severed artery, was found near a pig's coffin in a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder is preparing to develop a pig vaccine against a pig on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
According to the report, he traveled with his cousin from Yunnan's small town on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in a market.
And the next day she fell sick and died, and when they had washed her body, they laid her in an upper room.
There was a large herd of pigs feeding on the mountainside.
A forensic study confirms that a 550-pound pig is growing, according to the report.
"Down and twisted the legs of my cousin," this was his cousin, who was known only by his surname "Wu," in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera video showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to get his pigs.
His body was found about an hour ago.
Yuan or his cousin did not possess the animal that killed the man.
An Evening News market manager tried to stop the pig from attacking, while the local police were catching evidence.
According to the report, there have been negotiations between Yuan's family and market authorities for the payment for his death.
Although rare, there have been cases of swine attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical damage to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig forced the Welsh into his tractor until his wife scared him away.
After his pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs weren't usually aggressive but could serve to "pull" the taste of blood on them.
"They're just playing.
They're so cute, so honest... they don't want to hurt you.
You just need to give them enough respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa has reportedly carried heavy and heavy rains in the southwestern U.S.
As already mentioned, Hurricane Rosa is moving toward the colder waters of Mexico's shallow coast.
However, Rosa will bring flooding and rainfall throughout the rainy seasons of Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the days to come.
Rosa, who was a Category 1 Hurricane, was in the air at 85 mph on Sunday at 5 a.m. Eastern time, and woke up at 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to start a rally on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough surrounds the Pacific Ocean and moves northeast to the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it begins to push a tropical rainforest toward the southeast of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, make the tropical humidity poisoned by the advancing trough of extensive and heavy rains in the South-West in the coming days.
In the locality, dangerous flash floods, debris flows, and desert landslides will result in 1 to 4 inches of rainfall.
Deep tropical moisture causes intervals of about 2 to 3 inches per hour in some areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected between two and four inches [2-4 inches] in the southwest, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the goal of tropical rainfall.
It's not good to go out and walk in the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Canyons can be flooded by torrential rains, and storms with local strong winds and thunderstorms can cause flooding.
Local heavy rains will bring the approaching depression to some parts of Southern California.
It's possible that the intersection would be more than half an inch long, which could lead to a slight debris and rough road.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Some tropical rains begin to reach Arizona on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, before the rain falls on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
Heavy rainfall in the Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
As the Arctic cools, there will be subtle changes in temperature across the U.S. in October, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
However, it causes gradual temperature changes over narrow distances.
There is a fine example of contrasting temperatures across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is an almost 20-degree difference in temperature between Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next day, the remaining heat of the day will rise and rise again.
It is expected that there will be a hot October with a wide 80s in the mid-eastern U.S., from the Southern Plains to some parts of the East.
New York may reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, with an average of 10 degrees higher than practice.
Our weather report says the odds are higher than the average temperatures for the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people, Brett Kavanaugh listened to
More than 20 million people witnessed shocking testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters postponing a regular program for Friday's final blow: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to conduct a case investigation with the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and that he was trying to get him out of a high school party.
In a hot testimonial, Kavanaugh said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company counts a common number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers did not immediately become available for other networks that broadcast them, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people's responses.
To be clear, this is equivalent to a lot of people watching the playoffs of football or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel headed the networks, where opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's engagement, with a total audience of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day, Nielsen said.
The ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
There are 1.3 million on CBS, there are 2.94 million on NBC, there are 2.89 million on MSNBC, and there are 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after hearing.
Flake was the lead character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican voter's response in favor of Kavanaugh was released, CNN and CBS arrested him on Friday morning when protesters discussed taking the elevator to a Judiciary Committee word.
She stood up and lowered her eyes as she was insulted for a few minutes, and released it live on CNN.
"I stood in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He was told, "You have power while there are many women without power."
Before the elevator shut down Flake said that his response came out, hearing the committee he would say more.
News is that it's live hours after all the cables and broadcast networks, while the Judiciary Committee must vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate to vote on it.
But Flake said he would only do so because his understanding is that the FBI is investigating the charges against the nominee next week, pushed by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and many other senators, Flake was on the scene.
Flake had the power, because it was clear that Republican voters could not approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'political' Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "politics" ahead of Britain and national interest fishing in an interview in the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson pointed out her attack on May's foreign Chequers plan for Brexit, saying Britain and the EU should collect individual tariffs "like empty."

"That's what you're always concerned about," Wade said.
Ash erupts in Mexico City
Homes in the south of Mexico's capital reached the ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention said on Saturday that the volcano would be evacuated after crater activity rose and registered 183 air and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center is monitoring a lot of misunderstandings and screaming.
Images on social media show thin ash dumping into car windshields in areas of Mexico city such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed a 45-mile (72 km) increase in volcanic activity in the southeastern capital following a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano has been known as "Don Goyo" since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists before the vote's anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes with pro-independence protesters with police, and thousands joined the movement to seek the first anniversary of Catalonia's tenure.
Eggs and powder paint a group of pro-separatist masked police officers to stop them, and they create black clouds of oak on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
There was also a riot in the afternoon and the police used battalions to control the fighting.
Pro-independence groups have long called "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness" ahead of unionists protesting chanting, "Long live Spain."
More than four people were donated to the minor wounds taken at the protests, reports the local newspaper.
Tensions remain high in the region called for marriage after a year-long referendum on October 1 declared illegal in Madrid but ruled by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted on their own, but few voted because they voted for the majority of the protesters.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police blocked the vote to police stations across the region in violent attacks.
Pro-independence groups camped Friday night to curb movements supporting the country's police force.
The movement continued but was forced to change to another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest along with his wife, said that he was no longer expecting the possibility of Catalonia getting the deal.
"Last year, we experienced one of our greatest moments.
I heard my parents cry because they voted but we're not going down now," he said.
Recently, in a regional election victory last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have been struggling for three years because they have been imprisoned and waiting to hear many of their top leaders because of their role in organizing the referendum and the declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who re-recorded her protest phone support for the police, is the only one left by politicians on both sides.
"It's just getting worse," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of Catalan's nine pre-trial leaders, announced that he would run for European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for the European election is the best way to condemn the denunciation of democratic principles and opposition that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Dolly Menga's tie was needed to hang Gary Holt's team in the Hiberian second.
Gerrard's team remained winless in the Premiership this season and they will face the top Hearts which only brings them eight points, next Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers had beaten Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston had their winless game in the six-game division, along with head coach Holt who hadn't lost since Kenny Miller was replaced last month.
Livingston lost a chance against brusque visitors
Holt's team must have been leading long before they hit the ground, if it wasn't for their being a direct cause of trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson passed, but tried to get away, and Alan Lithgow's bull went away because he was buried by Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts were happy to kick the Rangers in front of them, knowing that they could beat the visitors at points.
And in this way comes the important goal.
The Rangers handed a free-kick and earned Livingston a chance, helping Declan Gallagher and Robinson serve Menga, who got the ball and scored from the center of the box.
At that point, the Rangers got the ball but they had a hard time getting on the defensive and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had a hard time,
This continued in the second half, as if Alfredo Morelos needed to save Kelly.
Scott Pittman caught the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow stood away from another set of Livingston play.
There were moves on Livingston's side and still thrown, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's passing on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were dealt with.
'Surprise' from Livingston - Search
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Amazing gameplay and results for Livingston.
In a person, they are good, constantly exceeding expectations of upward progress.
Their style of play hasn't changed very much and people start when they've been the best again, but it's a big compliment to go to Holt in his push with the team since he came.
He's got a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett, the leader of the organized defense, was successful, while Menga beat Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the fight.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
No matter what Gerrard came from, they couldn't reach those marks.
They lacked their last ball--only once they opened their sides--and it seemed this call to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the ranks.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's reaction in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met to speak in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They have won over talks about human rights, freedom of expression, and Turkey's ascension to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
It is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
The police caused security for 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see their leader.
Anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also called for Erdogan's policies and the German government's reception to the country.
Two different protesters mirrored the glamorous guest whom some German Turks call heroes and others call dictatorships.
Dept. of Dept. of Road: Cyclist Killed in Car Crash
A cyclist died after colliding with a car in London.
The incident took place near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a street in Deptford, southeast of the town, at 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The incident took place a few months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, nearly a mile away from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said they're working to understand the man's identity and to say goodbye to his relatives.
Some roads and bus routes were blocked and motorists were instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison officials were injured in a riot in a men's high-security prison, the Prison Office said.
The HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire started at 09:30 BST on Sunday and is currently continuing.
Specialist "Tornado" officers were sent to deal with the chaos, taking eight prisoners and keeping them in one wing.
Officials were added to the scene for minor facial cuts.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "There have been specially trained men to deal with the current HMP Long Lartin incident.
Six people were injured.
We don't want to stop the violence in our police stations, and we make it clear that the responsible are being turned over to the police and could be held longer."
There are more than 500 detainees in HMP Long Lartin, among the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the policeman was hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, riot officials were called to the prison to arrange a serious riot in which personnel were attacked by pool balls.
Typhoon Rosa's Big Flood in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Can Help Purpose Areas)
Tropical depression is rare in Arizona, but it could happen in the first half of next week because of the surge of Typhoon Rosa in the Southwest Desert, carrying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service for Monday and Tuesday for Arizona to southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, along with the towns of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Typhoon Rosa is expected to hit Phoenix directly on Tuesday, and it will be near Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that "just a few tropical storms have sustained a tropical storm or depression state 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest Hurricane Center models hold between 2 and 4 inches of rain, measuring between 10 and 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Probably get 1 to 2 inches in the rest of the Desert Southwest along with the central Rockies and the Great Basin, which probably has a total of ten to 4 inches.
For those who don't expect a sudden flood, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because of the region's intention.
After taking the floods seriously, this rainy season is likely to be beneficial because the Southwest is currently undergoing a disaster.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, about 40 percent of Arizona's population suffers from artificial intelligence, the second-highest in the category," weather.com reports.
Hurricane Rosa will be the first to landfall on Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Still looking at the hurricane's intensity and maximum winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, Typhoon Rosa was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, heading for the rat at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The hurricane has submerged the colder waters of the Pacific and will eventually be reduced.
So it is expected to landfall in Mexico with severe tropical storms on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico could be severe, bringing with it the huge risk of flooding.
"It is expected that 3 to 6 inches of rain in Baja California will be expected until Sonora's south-west, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reports.
Typhoon Rosa will then head to Mexico as a tropical storm before the Arizona border hits Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then head south of Arizona to southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main risks expected in Rosa or her lips are heavy rainfall in Baja California, severe western Sonora, and in the U.S. Desert Southwest," said the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will cause dangerous flash flooding and debris flowing through deserts, and landslides in a rugged area.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four, Arrested in Homicide
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for allegedly committing murder, after a 16-year-old man with footprints was found in Somerset.
A teenage boy was spotted in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he remained in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area of Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials appeal to anyone who has a footage of what happened on the phone to show up.
Kavanaugh 'defeated, angry' by Democratic Party, says Trump
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to reject the brutal and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "hardened" by the Democratic Party's "wrongness, anger" in the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified to Congress on Thursday, forcing and emotionally defending Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that she had passed it decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to hearing about his accusation.
The President said on Saturday that "the Americans saw Kavanaugh's strength and courage" that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to confirm one of the most powerful brains in the law of our time, a jurist with a mechanized history of public service," he said at a gathering of supporters in West Virginia.
The President spoke loudly about Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm election.
"It's only five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"So wherever I am, the great candidate is being fought."
Trump said the Democrats' mission was to "fight and block."
Kavanaugh's first major Senate procedural vote in the nomination is expected to be held shortly Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
An earthquake and tsunami killed in Indonesia, as expected
A total of 384 people were killed, most of whom were hit by giant waves in the countryside, when a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
An old crowd gathered for a festival in the town of Palu on Friday in the shadows of six metres (18 feet) in the darkness, as most of them died and closed all their paths.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"But the tsunami threat has risen yesterday, people are still carrying out activities in the area and don't immediately leave and become victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's agency BNPB, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"Not long ago there was no tsunami, it hit the cars, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami hit the sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before crashing into the air.
Others climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
A total of 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial images from the agency showed many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges that were torn and shattered and a water-soaked mosque.
Aftershocks continued to hit the city on Saturday.
2.4 million people were affected by a series of earthquakes.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Greater Global Warming.
The geography of the city, positioned at the end of the long and narrow bay, the magnitude of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the pinsala as "wonderful" and said thousands of detainees, hospitals, selectors, and hotels were in a mess.
The bodies of other victims were found to be pressed under the rubble, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualty and pinsala could be higher than 300 km (190 miles) in the ng Palu rat, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "has been completely cut off with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can grow," he said.
The agency was widely disheartened on Saturday as they did not report that a tsunami had struck in Palu, but officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the delay.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top of a building was shown screaming fears of the approaching tsunami on the streets below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water was smashed into the water, since the buildings and cars were built.
Reuters did not immediately testify to the footage.
An earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military is starting to send airplanes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but there is still a need to avoid food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened for relief efforts and it remained closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of people killed in the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
He's got it.
As the World Vision staff arrived safely in the town of Palu from Donggala, where the employees stayed in the tarpaulins that were being sheltered in the backdrop of their grocery store, they saw scenes of paint on the road, Mr. Twelve said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's like that.
Even as relief groups began to begin the dramatic start of disaster relief efforts, some have complained that they were preventing young aid workers who had the skills to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, housing, equipment, and people from other countries can only begin to arrive when the disaster zone is declared a national disaster zone.
It's not happening yet.
"This disaster has been going on for a long time," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'O.K., this country is a disaster,' we're going to be open to three other countries but we're not in a situation right now."
At the end of the second night in Palu following Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those who have lost their loved ones continue to look forward to the miraculous revival of the soothing stories of national disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was taken from a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman's rescuer was placed in a cave where her mother's body had been kept for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the founder of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended in the first half of this month in Indonesia.
Some of those stranded at the Two Two Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As more prominent in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional responsibility," she says.
Mr. Gendon acknowledged that, in the hours following the paragliding community's news of the Roa Roa Hotel rumbling, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to Palu players, who were celebrating in the hallway.
But his messages only resulted in a colored check mark, instead of a pair of blue checks.
"I think, mean at the time, the messages weren't sent," he said.
Thieves set to pay <0x24>26,750 while unloading ATMs in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves set aside <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's manufacturer who refills ATMs in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport's Police Department.
The car driver's body took an ATM into the entertainment complex and was trying to deliver more money, writes Det. Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While he was upset, another man "running from behind Brink's man" and stealing a bag of war had to be handed over.
Several witnesses who escaped from the scene were found guilty, according to the release, but the police did not specify the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Anyone should have information about their identity with Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper will change his name for Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name - to Ye.
In her announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: "The former Kanye West is recognized."
Ye West, 41, has been on the air for a long time, and he used the hype as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came first with his release of Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He's going to show singer Ariana Grande cancelled for "emotional reasons," the producer said.
In addition to the advent of his current professional name, West used to say that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, 'you' means it," West said in the first part of this year's discussion of the title of his album to radio host Big Boy.
"If so, I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
In the same way, we have many members, one body, and one body. All of these members serve as one body, and all the other members serve as one body.
The album has a lot to say about who we are."
He was one of the popular rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but in this year, he advertised the popularity of the names Love and Brother Love.
Satisfied with having or not having a big name sign, the former West collaborated with JAY-Z.
AMLO of Mexico says no military use against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico has pledged never to use military force against civilians while approaching the country on the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliatory against students.
Lopez Obrador claimed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "the military will never be used to select Mexican consumers."
Soldier troops exploded during a violent demonstration in the area on Oct. 2, 1968, during which as many as 300 people died during the devastating student movements across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican children by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more public schools.
He said that the lack of jobs and opportunities for education would be a problem for youth in criminal groups.
U.S., A.I. must be doubled
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, it should double the U.S. price it spends on cost research, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who works for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
Comments after making ads about AI have said different parts of the U.S. government, although the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy as a whole.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: it will continue to be No. 1 in AI change by 2030.
"It's a good start to doubling the AI research budget, as the U.S. has tremendously abandoned all other countries, and we're looking for the next success in AI," Lee said.
The double-double in stopping the chance in the U.S. will make the next big success in AI, Lee told CNBC in an interview with this caveat.
Lee, with the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invests in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an AI system that defeated America's best player of Others, and then became a co-founder of Microsoft Research and head of Google's China branch.
Lee recognizes past U.S. government technology challenges such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asks when the next challenge will be handled, to help identify future visionaries.
Usually, researchers in the U.S. have to work hard to get help from the government, Lee says.
"China is not going to take on top academics; otherwise corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have taken luminaries from farms to work on AI over the years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy would help the U.S. facilitate its AI efforts.
"I think it's a good idea to have green cards for those with a PhD in AI," he said.
China's State Council outlined its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people and academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to researchers from the U.S., but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
For the first part of this year, the U.S. Defense Department provides the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to consider industry and academia partners, and the White House announces the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
Among NSF's, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been seen in the U.S. law calling for a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence in a few months.
Macedonians, vote to change the country's name in a referendum
Macedonians would vote if they changed the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" in a referendum last week, a move that would have been smooth for decades between Greece and NATO, which they longed to seek to become a partner in the European Union and NATO.
And when he had passed thence to Makedonia, Makedonia besought us to enter into Makedonia.
The two governments agreed on a new name in June, but nationalists have warned that changes in the ethnic identity of the Slavic main population of Macedonia will be undermined.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and raised doubts about the boycott campaign if the turnout would reach the 50 per cent minimum necessary to hold the referendum.
This was the ballot's question at the referendum: "Would you like to be a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the treaty with Greece?"
Supporters of the purchase of the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have suggested that it is worth the effort to join groups such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I am going today to vote for the future of the country, for the Macedonian youth, to live free under the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not covered by the law, enough members of parliament said they would follow the results of the vote to improve it.
A name change is necessary for the two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state commission said there were no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters were voted on.
"I'm here because of my kids, we're in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and son Dushko voted for a referendum on the country's name change that would pave the way for it to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and waiting for chairs in front of tents to accommodate the vote-boycotts in the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join long distances and not enter the door of the gates," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia, and be part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a level of employment of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority agrees because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said the "yes" result would be a "proof of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research of Macedonia said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will be on the referendum - short of the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they voted yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent and one vote.
Let's look at the referendum as the first strike against the government's policy since it took over in May last year.
View: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero wins full defense of Brighton for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling kicked Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero quickly made the game his points in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker is on the way to midfield at the start of the series.
He left between the three defenders of Brighton, before pressing the open field.
Afterwards, Aguero saw himself surrounded by four green clothes.
He forced a defender before going ahead to run some more at the end of the Brighton box.
Then he left to go to his left and found Sterling.
English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to gulp Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan a bull on that right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet," City chief Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky that he scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the starting lineup in the Premier League.
That goal hit in the 29th minute.
Aguero looked at the ball while in the middle of Brighton territory in the game.
He sent a fine ball through the length of the left flank to Leroy Sane.
They did what Sane did before taking Sterling to the far post.
Sky Blues forward stuck the ball into the net before passing through the border.
City played Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, likes to play as spoiler vs. Rockies
When the Nationals were disconnected from the playoffs, there was no reason to insist on another start.
But always opponent Scherzer hopes to take the spot in the Sunday round against the Colorado Rockies, but that's when the Rockies still have implications in the playoffs with a playoff run against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
In any case, the Rockies won a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but hope to secure their first division title.
"Once we played for nothing, we were able to step on the mound, however, knowing that feeling here in Denver, along with the team and the team, was probably the highest level of any point I could expect in this year.
Why don't I want to fight there?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they are reluctant to let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer held a bullpen session on Thursday to make his 34th start, and pitched on the usual day of his break on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump, Rally in West Virginia
The President did not address the situation in which he voted for Supreme Court-run Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of Republican outcomes in the midterm elections.
"All of our November events are at stake.
It's only been five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones -- I can't run but I'm really running, so I'm scared to fight the good candidates," he said.
Trump added, "You see this radically involved group of Democrats, you see it's happening right now.
And they are determined to remove the power by any means necessary, you can see the evidence, the intensity.
They don't care who they are hurting, who they should use to gain control, power and control as they please, and we can't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, had a mission of "resistance and arrogance."
"And you see that in the last four days," he says, as Democrats call it "wrath and rage and lies."
She named Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat ranked member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who received a huge public vote.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you release the document?
Ah, ah, what.
"No, ah no, I'm waiting alone -- that awful body language -- the most insidious body language I've ever seen."
Labour, no longer a broad church.
Those who proclaimed them thought they would no longer accept it.
When Momentum activists came to my local party to arrest me, it was no longer surprising.
Anyway, I was the last in the line of Labour MPs to be told we didn't get it - all because of the disclosure we had in mind.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she stood up to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I've received a petition of censorship to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, which overturns similar issues where Jeremy disagrees with past leaders.
A reminder for Nottingham East Labor on Friday said that "we want the words to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, that's what GC says every Friday night.
Sadly today, it's not the tone of so many words and it's been a long time since we've forgotten the promise of "more understanding, more gentler" politics, if it really started anytime soon.
It has become increasingly common not to tolerate opposing views of the Labour party and to judge every opinion on whether it is acceptable to the party's superiors.
It started when Jeremy became the leader, as my first friends began to think that I had the same political vision that I was going to turn around and take positions that I would never have been in - whether in the EU's national security or single market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - there's a next wave of abuse on social media calling deselection, shaping the politics of ridiculousness, and saying I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that's not the only experience I have.
Indeed, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I'm directing are politically inclined to me.
I'm sorry for the proselytizing and determination of my colleagues to face a growing number of abusive sexists or racists every day but never back down.
One of the most destructive aspects of politics of this era is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should have a culture of acceptance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and along with each petition of "insecurity" or a change in the rules of choice, the more narrow the party is.
I've had a lot of headaches over the past two years I've just stooped down, don't talk too much, and then, "I'll be fine."
But that's not what I wanted to do with my political pregnancy.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, arousing feelings of neglect by Thatcher's administration that he said he literally ran the classroom of my comprehensive school, I've been trying to attract better public services for those who need more -- as local councillors or as local councillors.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can lie in any way about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who advanced the petition on Friday, all I wanted to say was, if the country were to step up towards a Brexit that would disrupt our social, economic, and public services, I didn't understand the idea of wasting time and effort on my right to the leader of the Labour party.
But, to be honest, the message I have is not in Nottingham Momentum, if it's not in my wits, whether it's a Labour member or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of de-selection or political expedition will prevent me from acting in any way I think you're most interested in.
Nottingham East MP Chris Leslie
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Climb to the highest of the unjust Ayr
The last two tests also passed the final, but Ayr deserved to win the surprising and exciting Tennent Premiership day.
They're at the top of the table now, the vertically unstable side of the pond.
In the end, their remarkable defense, like their better chance, took home side and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been tested with our games until now, and we haven't been defeated yet, so be happy I should be," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The beautiful in Ayr, they're better off having sex than we are."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which Frazier Climo had converted, put Ayr in front, but a yellow card for Scotland cap named Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors' game, gave Melrose a point and Jason Baggot got an unconverted try.
Climo scored Ayr's lead in a penalty shoot-out, before, right at half-time, he pointed and converted a solo try to do it 17-5 at Ayr on the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt was reduced, with Baggot converting just five points.
Afterwards, there was a long wait for a serious blow to Ruaridh Knott, who was driven out by the stretcher, and from the restart, attacked Ayr forward through Stafford McDowall's attempt to convert Climo.
A yellow card gave Ayr captain Blair Macpherson, and again, Melrose allowed the rest of the men to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of the battle of a fierce force.
However, the home side returned and when Struan Hutchinson was left with a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, and from the penalty line-out, MacPherson touched down behind the forward Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanker Gregory Henry away for the fifth try of the home side.
Player of the Still Game, it looks like it's ready for a new career in the candy industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seemed ready to move into the hospitality industry, after discovering that he was named the director of a licensed gaming company.
Playing as Jack Jarvis is a 56-year-old on the popular BBC show, which he co-wrote and co-wrote with his comedian Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth series would be due to the run of the show, and it seems that Kiernan is planning for life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor was late to comment on the story, but the writer of the Scottish Sun commented that Kiernan seemed to be part of Glasgow's "small restaurant trade."
'Of all the seas': landlocked Bolivia, hopes to re-open the road to the Pacific
Sailors patrolling a naval force that never rigging in La Paz.
The public buildings were waving with a whirlwind of blue sea.
Wet seas from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are said to be: "In us the sea is by law.
It's a responsibility to get back here."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, it is still clear that a beach lost due to the loss of Chile to a bloody singularity in 19th-century landscapes - such as the request to re-sea in the Pacific Ocean.
The expectations for decades may be high, as Bolivia awaits the ruling of the Global Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has a sense of loneliness, and security, and it hopes, of course, to have a positive outlook," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are watching the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, full of hope that a court in The Hague will approve Bolivia's request that - after decades of controversial talks - Chile is obliged to work together to give Bolivia a free track to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native leader - who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year - has many other matters that have touched on Monday's decision.
"We are about to return to the South Pacific," he promised in the last part of August.
But some reporters believe that the court has little chance of making a decision in favor of Bolivia - and little will change if that happens.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the power to override Chilean territory, and it has agreed that it will not allow for possible conversations.
The case is "uncomplicated" based on the ICJ's decision six months after hearing the last arguments, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean lawmaker.
And far from advancing the Bolivian conflict, it could have been delayed for the past four years.
"The current administration of Bolivia has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," Zárate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric made whatever remained of the good will of the Chileans, he blessed.
At one point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to start discussions afterwards.
The two countries have not been replaced by ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, led by Bolivia in The Hague, adopted the idea that the court's decision is not unusual.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the chance "to release 139 people whose differences have benefited from both sides," he said.
Calzadilla also gave Morales - another of Latin America's most famous leaders - the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The counsel is the opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless the United States can be trusted.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that the country would never destroy its nuclear missiles if it could not trust Washington.
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to continue the promises made at a Singapore summit between rival countries' leaders.
His remarks come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about the start of a nuclear diplomatic break after the summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un more than three months ago.
Ri said it was a "desperate dream" to bring North Korea to its knees by steadily enforcing U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War.
Washington is cautious about adopting a declaration that Pyongyang is not yet making significant steps to lift the blockade.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are both expecting a second summit.
But there is growing doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the emergence of obstacles that the country may see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
In Paris fashion shows have revealed the latest line of huge head-to-head intersections that are about to come out on a High Street near you
If you want to expand your collection of hats or close the sun, don't look for anyone else.
Valentino and Thom Browne's designers showed off a pair of strange headbands for their SS19 collection on the runway and the Paris Fashion Week style set became a surprise.
This summer Instagram spreads over extra-practical hats and these designers bring their call-and-clicks to the catwalk.
Valentino's long-sleeved piece is a really strange beige hat made with a wide brim of long-haired birds that surrounds the heads of models.
Along with many other great artists, there's a tall dragonfly, a wizard hat and even a pineapple -- but it's not designed to keep your head smooth.
Thom Browne also showed a lesson in the famous mask that's right for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had Hannibal Lecter's more attractive and more attractive look than haute couture.
There's a scuba diving gear with snorkel and goggles, while there's another cone of melted ice cream.
And if you continue this damaging fashion statement--you're lucky.
Prophesy by style watchers, the big bonnet is about to go out on the high streets near you.
The timely arrival of the sweaty hat followed by 'La Bomb', the straw hat with a brim of two paces and saw the dresses of everything from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label on the back of the extraordinarily non-practical hat posted on social media sent out yet another large piece to the catwalk - a beach bag made of straw that was almost the size of a swimsuit model with its body in it.
The gray burnt orange raffia bag, painted by raffia fringing and with an accompanying white leather handle, is a self-taught piece at Jacquesmus's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I expect to see big hats and beach bags coming up on the high street next summer – because of the size of the designer’s impression, it’s hard to ignore the demand for large accessory.’
John Edward: Language skills that are important to global audiences
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continues in 2018 with the help of another round of excellent exam results, which has been greatly expanded by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other projects in the community.
As well as more than 30,000 students from other parts of Scotland, these schools, known as The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are reaching out to provide the best possible level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, in their chosen careers and areas of global competition.
As an educational sector that designs and implements an active curriculum in school, we see modern languages continue to be popular and preferred subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, enter it in his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we don't just have to rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the exam this year, we can see that the language of the league tables has the highest rate of transmission to independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages got a higher A mark.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS students, showed that 72 percent of students obtained a higher mark A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also obtained A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting language as essential skills that young people will not need in the future.
Today's languages, as selective themes, are defined as the equivalent of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) themes in the curriculum of independent schools elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, it was found that among the reasons employers for the difficulty of starting vacant positions, 17 percent were due to lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare children for their future careers.
Along with the increase in potential job opportunities that require knowledge of the language, these skills are important in a globalized world.
Whatever a person's career chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a future advantage because of having a survival ability like this.
People who speak multiple languages will automatically have the opportunity because of their ability to communicate directly with people from other countries.
In 2013, according to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were not able to communicate in a foreign language and only French spoke a two-digit percentage, which is 15 percent.
That's why it's important for young people today to invest in language learning.
Being able to speak multiple languages, particularly in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools are different when it comes to the languages they teach.
Many schools will be taught in more classical modern languages, while others will be taught the languages designated as most important for the UK by the quarter of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there's always a choice of language in independent schools, with leg specialists at this price.
Independent schools in Scotland have learned to differentiate between learning to prepare children and to give them the skills necessary to succeed, whatever their future may be.
It is not possible at this time, in the area of global business, that knowledge in the language is important for the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
Without a doubt, modern languages should be referred to as the "capacity of global interaction."
Independent schools will continue to offer this service, diversity and excellence for Scotland's youth.
Il fait bien le juste.
John Edward the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait for fans to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers is nearing an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the preseason opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not clear if he'll play for a few minutes.
"It's longer than a minute but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably have limited minutes to play.
Following the rehearsal on the first part of the week, James asked about his plans for six games on the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this point of my career to be ready," she said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump will start a campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five scheduled Trump rallyes next week, including visiting allies such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote awaits confirmation for his elected vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support for upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans are demanding that Congress lose control when it votes in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below through the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to hold on to hearings in this speech for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense among the prosecution's parameters for the alleged seizure of a Senate confirmation that lasted up to a week while the FBI was investigating.
But the main goal of these rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum ahead of the November election.
As a result, President Trump's campaign said the five rallyes next week focused on "enlisting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"It's important to have control of Congress for its agenda that leaders go to as many states as possible as we can toward a lost campaign season," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign.
The rally was scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight and could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and get a press release from Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will be the second time in the last month to visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is late on the ballot.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that he has to go to the head to try and get him on the ballot," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showcases courage to keep hope for Sunday singles
After three one-sided matches, the foursomes on Saturday afternoon may need this Ryder Cup.
The "swinging pendulum of momentum" is a completely invented concept in the sports field but players believe it, especially in competitions like this.
So, according to them, where's the momentum now?
"They've only got six points, and now they're only four, so maybe we've got a little momentum," Jordan Spieth said as he left.
In Europe the sale is, of course, only four points and a further twelve.
The Americans, Speith says, think they have a little bit of weight and a lot of strength, because Spieth and Justin Thomas have played together all day and have three points from four.
Spieth led her side and sanitized her from tee to green.
As the festivities grew more intense as he reached the round, he was able to insert an important putt into the four match boards after becoming two down after two with Thomas.
He also had a similar scream that beat them in the 15th match, the scream that says the fight for the American side is not over.
"You just have to try hard and think about yourself," Spieth said.
That's all that's left for every player.
18 holes to make the mark.
The only players with points higher than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days have been Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most unusual Ryder Cup tale.
Four out of four and nothing can make a strange but amazing pair from Europe go wrong.
"Molliwood" is the only pair that doesn't get bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also get out of the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
That bug, and how their energy seems to be moving from and to the fastest viewer, is proof that they are the players who should be on Sunday, and that no other player is more popular than the Europeans who can win at the Le Golf National without Fleetwood or Molinari.
If that's the case, go through different holes.
But one European victory seems to have been delayed.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, to make Alex Noren's match.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine sent Spaniard and Swede, and they weren't getting up yet.
But on Sunday, no one helped you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very close to each other because of the interactions between couples, the heads they give and don't give, and the possible sudden change in strategy.
Europe's game as a team is much better now and they hope to make it to the final day but this foursome session shows the strength and strength of Team USA that some suspect, especially Stateside.
Europe hopes 10-6 to enter the final day of the Ryder Cup
Only Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out on Saturday from fourball and foursome matches with only 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molini led the pair with two victories against struggling Tiger Woods to take their tally to four points now at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to win the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American side who missed the morning fourballs, and won the series 3-1.
The United States fought more than foursomes, and won two games but they couldn't lower the chances.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four consecutive points as he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a great weekend, the second pair to win four points from their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After Woods and Patrick Reed finished fourballs, it was amazing how they were able to pull out the force to defeat disillusioned Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau at 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who pitched himself in two matches on Saturday, showed up for a chance to win but received a defeat in 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose took a break for the fourballs in the morning, and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for the 2<0x26>1nd that of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who were ranked first and third in the world.
The sun has not been beautiful for Europe despite the clear and windy weather in south-west Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans after scoring two points on Saturday.
They got a passionate 2<0x26>1 win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter ng Spain in the fourballs and returned to beat Poulter at Rory McIlroy 4<0x26>3 in the foursomes after beating the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team recovered from a four-point deficit to enter the singles, but as holders Furyk's side of the draw needed to keep the trophy.
After two days of second place, they don't seem to be able to make a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says it is 'unilateral' to unilaterally dismantle
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that their commitment to the United States was deepened because of ongoing sanctions and the country's unilateral refusal to give up its nuclear threats under such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of governments around the world that North Korea has made "valuable steps with a good body" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, launching a nuclear test site, and speculating that nuclear weapons and technology will not be developed.
"However, we don't see a corresponding agreement from the United States," he said.
"As long as there is no trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation we are not truly unilateral to fail."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's retaliation of a "seven-year" denuclearization debate over North Korea's long-running denuclearization, his statement seemed important because it did not immediately cover up the unilateral denuclearization like that of Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current President of the United States and North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear barriers.
Washington has also sought to reduce severe international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States is insisting on denuclearizing" and raising the morning of sanctions to achieve their objectives in a violent manner, and they are also pursuing "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The view that sanctions make us haughty is an eerie dream of those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanction deepens our awareness."
Ri did not discuss any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the United States leader announced at the United Nations on the first part of the week.
Instead, the minister said the three had held talks between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in for the past five months and added: "If South Korea and the United States are not the party on the issue of nuclear weapons, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be a deadlock."
However, Ri's tone of voice was quite different from last year's, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's U.S. territory of rockets after Mr. Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who said last year that he was "previously starting" North Korea, had showered congratulations on Kim for his bravery in taking steps to disarm, but said there was more to do and sanctions must remain until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for it, and also said, "If it's going to take two years, three years or five months - nothing."
China and Russia have argued that Pyongyang should be the name of the U.N. Security Council for steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "Security councils should continue to prosecute strict and unmistakable sanctions until we fully know about the event, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has co-imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to reduce the holdings for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times in the past three years, but his last trip has not been a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July, and said that there was an emergency, just to keep him from North Korea for making "great demand."
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to humiliate a missle site as well as a nuclear complex when the United States is making "equivalent steps."
He said Kim had challenged him with the "equivalent steps" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and that would lead to normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students, take a course about having enough rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University is helping its undergraduates get a good night's sleep in order to fight the macro culture of the study that has been through the night while being promoted by caffeine.
An academic found that students at the world's number one universities often don't know about the most basic ways to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first of its kind in the United States.
He had the inspiration to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleep control on learning.
'After this, a woman came up to me and said: 'Why have you just told me this, in my senior year?'
Saying to him, no one told him about the value of sleep--which I was surprised about,' he told The Telegraph.
This is the first time this year that the course explains to students the importance of having good sleep behavior and how it contributes to academic and athletic activity, as well as general health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to enter the course after learning that students were completely sleep deprived one week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is a picture of the dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to talk about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athletics, and the importance of a routine for sleep.
In another section, participants are told how sleep control increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
There's a campus map, with interactive icons, that encourages participants to think about their daily activities.
'We know that this doesn't immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have the right to know - like you have the right to know the effects on the health of smoking," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of having an ‘all-nighter' is still ambiguous, he says, and he adds that modern technology and increasing student pressure is what raises the problem of sleep deprivation.
The feeling that you have enough sleep, with good quality, should serve as a ‘secret barrier' for students to fight stress, to overcome fatigue and anxiety, he says - to avoid gaining weight, because the brain is putting sleep deprivation in the state of hunger, so they're starving all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after graduating from his first year at Harvard.
She said that she opened her eyes and she had the inspiration to pursue a learning course.
He hopes that the next step will require students to complete a study program like this before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students think about setting an alarm when sleeping and waking up, and assess the harmful effects of ‘blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can diverge from the circadian rhythm, and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is knocked out by Gerrard's team
The Rangers were again disappointed after Dolly Menga gave the character Steven Gerrard a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The Ibrox side wanted to record their first win at the rivals' stadium since winning 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard their second defeat in 18 games as manager, to hang his side eight points against the Hearts leading the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and didn't make any further appearance of the Rangers line-up lacking in inspiration.
As the Rangers dropped to sixth place, Livingston fell third and was just behind Hibernian in goal difference.
And maybe there's more problems waiting for the Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to give him some relief for the head injury after he seemed to throw something from the opponent's side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side to get through Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt used the same Livi 11 that focused on Hearts last week and he was just excited about how his great team managed to get their pairs on each turn.
The Rangers were over the ball, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They had to reach the point after two minutes to get close to Allan McGregor's goal, Menga's pass to Scott Pittman but the midfielder missed out.
A deep free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs was defeated by Craig Halkett but could do nothing to defend him Alan Lithgow loose forcing the ball back into the post.
The Rangers gained control but seemed to think much more than to believe that their plan would be carried out in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a penalty kick to hit a quarter of the game with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson filed the Colombian player's appeal.
The Rangers made two straight runs in the first half of the game but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not beat Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's brilliant strike.
While Livi scored in the 34th minute of the game, even though the opponent seemed to be better, they weren't fit because of their graft.
The Rangers are once again caught up in action against the deep set-piece of deep Jacobs.
Scott Arfield was reluctant to let Declan Gallagher pass the ball through the slot towards Scott Robinson, who calmly passed Menga for a quick finish.
Gerrard moved on to the break when he bought Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and almost had the quick effect of buying the winger to snag Morelos, but Kelly's astonishment quickly ran out of his line to make it happen.
But Livingston continues to make it difficult for visitors to play the exact kind of game they want, where the long balls of Lithgow and Halkett follow suit.
Holt's side could only have grown up in the seasons but McGregor managed to get through Jacobs well before Lithgow could go wide from the corner.
The Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another final weaving for a penalty because he and Jacobs had been involved, but Thomson hadn't seen it yet.
Almanac: The creator of the Geiger Counter
And now here's a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and STAY AWARDS... the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany to be a solar physicist.
Geiger is working on a method for the reference and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that will help identify a device called the Geiger Counter.
An important part of the story since, Geiger Counter has also been a major supporter of pop culture, in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado," featuring cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This Geiger Counter, used to refer to radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you actually hear the effects of atoms that radioactivity has on minerals."
Evans: "It must be sounding now!"
"Hans" Geiger left in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that hangs in his name remains.
A new vaccine against cancer teaches the immune system to 'retain' infectious cells
New vaccines against cancer are learning the immune system to 'remove' infecting cells and to remove them
As part of rooting, immunizations teach the immune system to adapt to harmful cells.
It's like taking immune cells out of the patient, and making them better in the lab.
Then they'll make these 'fix' the protein that's common to most cancers and then inject it back into them
Tested vaccines give successful results to patients with different types of cancer.
For more than 18 months, cancer in the ovaries of a female infected with the immune system has disappeared.
It's like taking immunocells from a patient, and making them work in a laboratory to "live" them, which is a protein commonly known to most cancers called HER2, and then injecting them back into the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "We are told by the results that we have a vaccine that we can expect."
HER2 is "induced by the spread of many types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explains Prof Berzofsky.
This type of leukaemia is used to root a similar process by removing immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to examine cancer cells.
Kanye West co-starred in the Pro-Trump Diatribe, Dressing a MAGA Hat, After his Exit on SNL.
It Didn't Have Good Results
The "boo" took Kanye West to the studio while playing Saturday Night Live after a long performance in which he beat U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After singing his third song for that night, called Ghost Town where he wore the Make America Great cap, he wrapped up the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"I've often talked to a white person and they say, 'How do you like Trump, he's a racist?'
If I'm concerned about racism, I'll have to leave America for a long time," he said.
SNL began the show in a kit featuring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legislative Committee about sexual media complaints that Christine Blasey Ford had made.
While it was not broadcast, joker Chris Rock uploaded footage of West's tweets on social media.
It's unclear if Rock asked you to humiliate West for the post.
In addition to this, West complained to the audience that he hadn't been seen on the backstage about his hat.
"They beat me up in the backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t go out wearing ‘that hat.’
They've bullied me!
And they say I'm in my sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see the sunken place?" when he said, "I'm pushing myself to superman's side, because it means, you can't tell me what to do.
Try to have love."
Due to his comments, the audience rose to fame at least twice and cast members of SNL humiliated, according to Variety's report, and there was a person who stated in the publication: "The whole studio is quiet."
West was entered as a woven shop for singer-songwriter Ariana Grande, who lost her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, just a few days ago.
West's singing of the song I Love it was a lot of trouble, which he got as Perrier Bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the most willing: THANK YOU FOR THE PERFECT MORE THANKS FOR MEN."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just real and there's no doubt about it."
"But I choose not to know a person (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "this") who I think is touching and expressing the ideology that connects with my community.
He had freedom.
And so do we," he added.
Earlier on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had bought the name, saying he was now "the one formally recognized as Kanye West."
She wasn't the first artist to buy her name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has the name of a former Snoop Lion and of course, the departed musical Prince, who changed his name and made him a symbol, and later became the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has revealed that it's the perfect fit for the game.
Kit Harington is known for his character Jon Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But as the actor, 31, pointed out, the stereotype of the brusque interlocutor, he thought such screen roles would lead to the young men's perception that they need to be tough for respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that something had gone wrong and questioned how to address the problem of destructive masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who was recently married to fellow Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, 31, also admitted that she "disappointed" her desire to discuss the issue.
'There's a difference in my personal preferences right now - where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What are the things we teach men as they grow up, based on the problems we see today?'
Kit believes that television has a role to play in increasing the amount of masculinity caused by the characters.
He continued: "What is the nature and what is the nature of it?
What's on TV, and on the streets, that makes young men think they need to be this kind of guy?
I think, ‘that’s really one of the biggest questions of our time – how can we change that?
Because it's clear that something is wrong for boys.'
He also admitted in the interview that he would no longer make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ended next summer, because he said, 'He's finished in the fields of warfare and riding'.
Starting in November, Kit was cast to rewrite Sam Shepard's True West story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he and his wife, Rose, knew what he described as the best thing that ever happened in Game of Thrones.
'I've met my wife in the 'too, it's become a reality when I have a family in the future, and in the future I'll be living here,' she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, who likes Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy award.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family farm in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China expects 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health officials.
A total of 40,000 new cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been passed on by interaction, marking change from the past.
HIV is usually spread rapidly in parts of China due to blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero in this way, according to Chinese health officials in a discussion in Yunnan province.
However, each year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China rises to 100,000.
An issue in China's LGBT community is HIV transmission through intercourse.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT members is still widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70-90% of men who marry a man are married to a woman.
Most of the illnesses are caused by the lack of protection in dealing with these disorders.
Since 2003, China's government has pledged general access to HIV roots as part of an effort to address the issue.
Maxine Waters pointed out that her staff had uploaded GOP senators' data, and pointed to 'exciting lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters posted personal information of three Republican senators in the U.S. on Wikipedia pages for the insurgents on Saturday.
The Los Angeles Democrat has accused the complaints of plotting "ultra-right wing" journalists and websites.
"Liars, lies, and more lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to the report, the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah, were included.
Information went online on Thursday, which was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill as a panel of members of the Senate staged hearing sexual immorality against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
A few minutes later, the three senators were looking at Kavanaugh.
In Hill's report, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState revealed that Waters' response linked the IP address to the origins of the posts and gave Waters staff members information.
"Searching for error and a lie is this unfounded lie," Waters continued.
"My staff member - who has compromised identity, personal information, and safety as a result of these devious and mischievous agents - has nothing to do with the spread of this information.
It's a mistake and a lie to this unscrupulous person."
Waters' statement quickly changed online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"There's anger at the point," Fleischer wrote.
"He said he didn't need a member of Congress to practice.
When a person is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He doesn't have to be a fighter.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He should be calm and courteous."
Fleischer passed by comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' rally against Judge Kavanaugh, who critics have accused him of being too preoccupied as Thursday's hearing took place.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for president, also expressed his opinion on Twitter that Waters would be running for the midterm seat.
"Let's see if there's any truth," he tweeted.
In his speech, Waters said that his response alerted "the seized authority and entities to enforce the law among its infringing complaints.
"We're confident that we'll get to know the people who act," he continued, "and we're going to make them into law for all they do, for all they do, and for all those who do, and for all my staff members, there's a danger."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - cut spy poof by Rowan Atkinson
Nowadays it is common to look for relevance for Brexit in any new British film and it seems to be absorbed in a new version of Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise - which began in 2003 in Johnny English and re-created in 2011 in Johnny English Reborn.
It's a new opportunity to export the country so it's very common to use self-awareness with a theme that's about how much sleep we can control?
In all respects, Johnny English, with his eyes wide open and eager, seemed to have a license to strike things again the second time -- more than anything else, making his name a joke that he had made for places where the audience did not speak English anymore.
Of course, he's a crazy secret agent who, despite his own ideas of being elegant, has a bit of Clouseau's character, Mr. Bean, and has been groomed by a portion of the man who contributed a note to the Chariots of Fire which was the theme for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He also originally met the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson had been playing in today's forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, where he caused trouble in his lair.
There's one or two good scenes in this latest JE show.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter as he was wearing a medieval blanket and the rotor blades quickly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent is seen in physical humor, but laughing hasn't become very natural, especially with the confidence that it will add humor as an element to the brands of "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible.
There used to be a sense of humor that it's tempting for children rather than those in the right adulthood, and for me, Johnny English's comic strips are not like-minded and quiet-movie-like that Atkinson's got in Bean's person.
The now long-held premise in the area is Great Britain's resettlement in a difficult situation.
A cyber-hacker has penetrated Britain's highly confidential web network of spies, venturing into the identities of all British agents in the field, causing disillusionment with the multitasking agent - a discouraging little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the best thing for the prime minister to shut down as a tall and tall man, who has come to be completely distracted by his human political support: Emma Thompson has explored the mala-Teresa-There's this character but hasn't been too attached to the script.
His intelligence advisers told him that because all the active spies had compromised, he had to get something back from the retirees.
And that's what high schooler Johnny English himself, who now works as a primary school teacher at an exclusive institution, but gives private learners how to become an undercover operative: it's funny, because it gives English the undergraduate School of Rock academy of espionage.
English was immediately summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former long-suffering sidekick Bough, who was playing again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, who married a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-stick paper in which Vicki Pepperdine was quite wasted.
Batman and Robin are back in action with the monsters in His Majesty's Secret Service, and they meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is at risk of falling into the lure of a charismatic tech billionaire who says he can solve Britain’s computer troubles: the mischievous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their long conversations with idiots: pretending waiters, they started a fire at an expensive French restaurant; they made a scene to ride unnoticed by Volta's rough yard; and English began to struggle with Volta's family that he tried to use Virtual Reality.
There's no doubt that the last half of that sequel is going well, but even though it's fun and exciting, it's all about being a youthful TV show.
It's not such a big deal.
And I can't help but think about other Johnny English films: wouldn't the British film industry be able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would bring justice to his talent?
Labour thought it was planning to have four working days a week for the British but they would be paid the equivalent of five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan to have four days in a row for the British - but they will be paid the equivalent of five days.
According to the party, the company's bosses want to pass on those who are struggling with a major change in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day of rest.
This allowed employees to have a three-day weekend -- but they could still return the same amount.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and plans for the country to favor workers has been 'taken'.
The Trades Union Congress endorsed the purchase of four days in a single round of work as a way to increase the opportunities for workers in the changing economy.
A senior source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: 'It is expected that policy analysis will be announced before the end of the year.
'It can't be done one night but the four days a week work is an ideal set in the party's direction to rebalance the economy for the co-workers and for the party's overall performance in the industry.'
The Labour Party was not the first to endorse this idea, as the Green Party promised to work four days a week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party is not currently endorsing this ideal as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'It is not the party's policy to work four days a week and the party does not consider it.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour debate last week to better explain his dream for an economic revolutionary socialism.
According to Mr. McDonnell, he's determined to withdraw power from the 'irrelevant directors' and 'year-old producers' of utility companies.
It also means the shadow chancellor's plans that current shareholders of water companies may not get the full amount of their stake because Labour's government could create 'reductions' for the carefree wrongdoers.
He has also signed plans to put the company's stockholders and Inclusive Ownership Funds into place to provide 10 percent of the private sector's equity to employees, which will have annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy said in "60 Minutes" that they could change their minds on Kavanaugh's FBI investigation
Due to the FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett, at least a week of hearings were held in his nomination to the Supreme Court, and there was a question as to whether those who were in charge would be responsible for Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes", correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything the FBI might find out about changing their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his partner from South Carolina.
"Yes," said Kennedy.
"When I said I was going to listen, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened ‘to, after the charge came out, I said, 'Did you do this?'
He's inside, he's determined, and there's no swimming."
However, Graham's vote seems unchanged.
"I'm already thinking about Brett Kavanaugh and a big charge is needed for it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but here's what I know: It's Brett's wife," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And it can't be confirmed by everyone whose name he is.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has It Ever Done Anything to Reduce Difficulty?
Today Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, a yearly music event with a hugely impressive line-up of stars who will be in attendance and with a similarly amazing mission; the world's greatest poverty.
In its seventeenth year now, the Global Citizen Festival will be hosted by thousands of people who will gather at the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes's presentation, but also to have some knowledge for the real purpose of the event to overcome the great tribulation of 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to reduce poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (except if you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees must complete a range of activities, or "moves" such as volunteering, sending emails to a global leader, calling a phone or doing something special to help spread the knowledge.
But how is it possible for a Global Citizen to live peacefully with only 12 years left before it reaches its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert to get people excited about movement or just adding it to so-called "clicktivism" - people feel they can make a real change by letting online petitions or tweets?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "movements" from its supporters, encouraging hosts of different goals.
These initiatives have helped to encourage world leaders to advertise trends and ensure the equivalent of more than <0x24>37 billion to make changes in the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the first half of 2018, the group removed 390 trades and advertisements starting with its move, and at least <0x24>10 billion of these were spent or already used for fundraising.
The group estimates that insured funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the main contributors is The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of U.K. investors and stakeholders who have studied "helping aging children who are exposed to their full potential," which promises to provide Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to help unleash malnutrition from the country's 4-year-old global tweet.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote that has only historically been the measure of justice in a nutritionally deficient society," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to people at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 movements in the U.K. called on mothers and children to believe in nutrition, the government of funding for a single project, Power of Nutrition, has announced that it will reach 5 million women and young people through nutritional methods.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website, it asked, "How do you think we can get rid of so much misery?"
Global citizen replied: "It's been a very difficult and difficult time - it's been a very difficult time, we're going through a lot of trouble.
But just like the former of us who had great movements in civil rights and movements against the policy of separating white to black, we were successful, because we were stronger together.
Along with Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe at the New York event, which was hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness at Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy for "roadblocking" to delay Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington will "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russia's transport of energy to the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's ties with Syria - particularly where it is running at the invitation of a legitimate government - are just a bribe to destroy new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to be as energy brokers as they are in the eastern part of Europe, the southern corner of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States, using our Navy, has the capability to make sure the sea routes are open, and, if necessary, conveniently, to make sure that their energy doesn't go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke with the leaders of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the "year of energy consumption" in the US.
He compared Washington's ways of dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are, in general, to benefit and replace energy," he said, while saying that Russia has a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements come as the Trump administration draws out its liquefied natural gas in Europe, which is consumers in Russia, a far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step up the "unattainable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is why Moscow has become "controlled" by Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double its current pipeline capacity to be 110 billion cubic meters, is an economic project only.
The Kremlin insists that Washington's objection to the project is only driven by economic reasons and an example of uneven competition.
"I believe that we have the same view that energy cannot be used as a compressive tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said in a speech to US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s view from Germany, which has supported the project, has reacted strongly.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to not interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"The problem is that other states are getting into our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren's "Impossible" to Run for President in 2020, says Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think carefully" about running for the presidency following the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our government and include a woman as head," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I'm really considering running for president."
Warren referred to President Donald Trump at the meeting, saying that "this country is being taken in the wrong direction.
"I'm really concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our economy," he said.
It used to be a task for Warren to speak out in his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents were not convinced that he should run by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Another 32% supported the event.
The survey showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's run, with 38 percent supporting the possible run and 48 percent opposing.
Among other high-profile Democrats discussed a possible run in 2020 by former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin tweets about Palin's PTSD track at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with family violence on Monday night.
"At my son's return, I understand other families that are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the emotions that our soldiers are bringing to their return," he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a serious problem not to talk about" and said that his son and other veterans of the war were "going back quite differently, they're back training in violence, asking if there's respect for anything given to the country by their fellow soldiers and military pilots, and every member of the military."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with family violence, particularly female aggravation, and harassment, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports questioning new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal questioning of a new U.S. policy that involves asylum for victims fleeing gangs or family violence.
Voters from 18 states and a friend-of-the-court brief district in Washington on Friday came to support a policy-questioning asylum seeker, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff's full name has not been left behind in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
He said he was abused by his partner "and the children of this violent gang," but U.S. officials attributed his request for asylum on July 20.
He was born in Texas.
Lawyers from the states supporting Grace portrayed El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where large numbers of applicants for U.S. asylum, as countries face widespread problems with gangs and family violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision in 2014 by the Immigrant Appeals Committee that allowed undocumented immigrants to escape violence at home to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District of Columbia Attorney General, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy is "ignoring decades of state, federal, and global laws."
"It is above the federal law that all asylum weaving is subject to certain facts and events of weaving, and such prohibition violates that principle," said the friend-of-the-court brief.
Attorneys at the briefs suggested that the practice of immigrants entering the U.S. economy is more likely to become entrepreneurs and that "hundreds of workers are in need."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to commit asylum to victims of family abuse and gang violence.
"Asylum is for those who flee their mad country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a policy statement on June 11.
Asylum is never meant to solve all the problems -- even all the serious ones -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to squeeze Palu as death toll doubling to squeeze survivors
For survivors, the situation gets worse.
"Extremely nervous," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her elbowed boy at an evacuation center in the northern town of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance arrives with a body.
There is not enough clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their shelters, picking up their garbage, trying to save anything they could see.
A long time ago people were injured and hospitals were on the verge of collapse, with a magnitude 7.5 quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had fractures in the back and shoulders, were left outside the Army Hospital of Palu, where patients were being rooted outside because of the continuous rapid aftershock.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how he felt the enormous earthquake in the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he and his wife and daughter were lying.
"There is no time to save ourselves.
I'm stuck in the fall wall that's it," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife's cry for help, then gone, it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda advertisements'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper praising the benefits of the U.S.-China encounter, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. newspaper to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump cited Wednesday's statement in the Des Moines Register - the most recent newspaper in the state of Iowa - after China was accused of meddling in the press for the U.S. congress on Nov. 6, a ceremony held by China.
Trump's move that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. has become a hindrance to what U.S. officials told Reuters a new era of Washington's campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to put in advertisements to draw speed, Beijing and Washington are now linked to a growing scale in which they have exchanged tariffs for individual imports.
Chinese tariffs in the early stages of the genocide are designed to target exporters in states such as Iowa to support Trump's Republican Party, experts in China and the U.S. say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products in China, said that Beijing has shut down American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion column in China's Des Moines Register on Sunday, "It's now undermining the protests by publishing propaganda in our own free newspaper."
"With the spread of its propaganda, China's government uses the most important American tradition of free speech and freedom of expression by passing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"While in Beijing's newspaper stores, you will find only a limited number of voices and you will not see a true image of Chinese disagreements about the troubling direction of China's economy, as the Chinese Communist Party has a tight grip on the media," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most offered newspapers in China went beyond the offer to present" this article, however he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans push women out of Botante before Midterms in Kavanaugh's Chaos, Tabala Tagasuri
While many major Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in front of some allegations of sexual abuse, the audience is worried that they will expect a fair response, especially from women, in the near midterm elections.
Emotions are deeply disturbed here, and most Republicans have seen that they want to continue voting.
Those things are not going to matter," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to support the FBI's investigation into angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it's open and not in November," said Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior head of state and country spokeswoman for the new MoveOn group, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters miss "November is coming!" as they rally in the Senate corridor as Republicans under the control of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination in the light of the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic's report.
"Democratic urgency and motive will be uncommon," said Stu Rothenberg, an undisputed political observer, on the news site.
"People say it's high; it's true.
But it can rise further, especially with swing female voters in the outskirts of town and with young voters, between 18- to 29-year-olds, who often don't vote, but they don't like the president."
Just before Ford's public testimony that he had filed allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, surveyers said there could be a pending reaction if the Republicans continued the confirmation.
"This is a big mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, a former head of the Republican National Committee, last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh is going to leave, it's also about how Republicans are going to get around this and how they're going to treat him," explained Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to attract Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be passing hearts as to who to believe in the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, the fewer the last time.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied to his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's dismissal, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's campaign allegations as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee after swearing last week that Kavanaugh had been abused when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez suggested that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his king while they were at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Developer Plans to Start New Internet to Fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that will be competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology address project, is a company developed from Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid advises users to choose where to store their data and what people are supposed to access for what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee argues that the goal behind Inrupt is to "cover the whole world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data store or POD.
Here you can store contact lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
For this Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at once.
The uniqueness of a personal online data store is completely controlled by the user who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "self-authorization by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to bring the company the processes, processes and acquired skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is co-founded by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
From this point on, technology developers around the world have created their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not going through a complete change in which all of their business models would be completely reversed in one night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-built web."
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet as he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
As Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee remains founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm positive for it next time on the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Klerigong won the Victoria Cross in WW1
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War as a mandrigma was invited to his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise at Lehaucourt.
But, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had reached the highest military ranks in Britain.
A stone pillar was removed by the lid of his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that he "looks like a rock" that's 100 years old from his grandfather's respectful work.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col Vann led his battalion in the waters of the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very heavy monsoon while it was raining ammunition from fields and machine guns."
He went to the first row and led the forward line with the "most odds" before starting with a field-gun and knocking all three out of the group together.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could not match but something humiliating."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also took a flower stop after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "the honor to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is shown by the support that many people will give."
Fans of MMA don't sleep tonight to watch the Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig watches
Think about it, you woke up tonight to watch the Bellator 206 axle but you didn't get to watch it.
The bill from San Jose will take 13 fights, including six on the main card and will be shown live throughout the evening in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their upcoming event, UK audiences were surprised that the cover changed and became Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after waking up until early in the day for the fight.
A fan on Twitter said that "it looks like a bad game" to move the young cartoon.
"Government matters that at 6 a.m. it's not appropriate to watch such a show so they have to move on to the younger one," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa the pig," yes.
Bellator company president Scott Coker has said they will adjust their schedule to include UK audiences in the future.
"If I think about the replay, maybe we can fix it," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we can't fix it until Sunday, Monday with them.
But we're fixing it.
You'll believe, when they move there, a lot of repetitive texts and all that rage.
We're trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it has something to do with the government.
I can promise that next time it won't happen.
We're only going to do five against the six--as usual we've tried a few times to beat the fans but we've overdone.
It's just a problem."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Admits ‘independence' due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that he grew smaller than others because of his sexuality - but that's what makes him successful.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't think until he came to secondary school that "it wasn't all like him."
Speaking on Lauren Laverne's first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
She also said that parenting has reduced her chances of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular lover of the long-running film, has been on sick leave for months.
After appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "lower" than the others as she grew up because "it's not easy for society to accept liking for fellow men and women."
He said: "Until now, those feelings that I am lessened, and I feel different, the real things that gave me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that "he's different," he said, so he couldn't deny everything they knew about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medal winner at the Olympics has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used her exit from the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries where homosexuality is a serious crime.
He said he spoke up because he felt lucky that he was living a life of no interest and that he wanted to give others "a hope."
The three-piece global champion said that a man's love -- US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 -- "was a surprise to me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than her, last year but said age was never a problem.
"When you're a kid" -- he first joined the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer after three years -- he says it's hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced the same joys and sorrows.
The couple became parents in June, to their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "broken outlook" changed.
"If you asked me last year, all that matters is, 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there's something more important than gold medals at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
Her son named Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father would not accept that he would die and one of the last questions he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front seat.
"I can't say to him that 'you didn't come to sit down to hope,' he said.
"I put my hand on her, and she stopped breathing, and I thought she didn't breathe, and she was dead, and I didn't take her," he said.
The following year Daley fought at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I know this is what I've been dreaming of all my life - to dive in front of people at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," she said.
It also inspired her first chosen song - Proud of Heather Small - to stare at her at the approaching Olympics and still fit in her fur.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson did not win the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will record Sunday when he plays in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to adjust his condition to avoid this sad event.
Mickelson, who played the biennial event for the record 12th time, was visited by Captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he often happens to be for the United States, the five-time major winner cuts his time between being a cheerleader and rehearsing in the range, hoping to bring anything wrong with him.
Since he had never been the most direct driver at the end of his career, the 48-year-old was not fit for the busy Le Golf National course, where false shots in the long rough were often a problem.
And for the poor course not enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, met British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who joined up with talented Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of them against this spell.
If the Americans, who fall by four points starting in 12 singles matches, start hot, Mickelson's fight may be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, because he didn't say anything else.
"Seeking to understand his role today, he stuck me in the back and embraced me and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"She had great confidence in herself.
He's Hall of Famer and he's added a lot to this team a long time ago, and in this mess.
I probably didn't dream of him playing two matches.
I had more than a dream, but that’s what happened and that’s what we thought we were going to do.
He wants her there too, just like everyone else."
Mickelson has surpassed Nick Faldo's record for the best Ryder Cup match of the week.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup without ever matching his highest individual record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 threes, and seven boards, however Furyk said that brought his presence some unseen benefit to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, he likes to play with people, and he's good at the team room," he explained.
"I think I've also enjoyed the younger guys playing with him, this week, and it's funny looking.
He's got more than enough to play."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that he will soon be gone
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knew that the Ryder Cup's big-day singles could easily be lost and could be an uncomfortable fight.
The Danish started the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros as captain was the five-pointer only to the Americans but narrowly missed the finish line due to a narrow margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we're only big at Valderrama; we're big at Brookline, and we're losing there, and at Valderrama, we're winning, but that's fine," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 Lef National.
So history shows me and all that team that it's not done yet.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Let everything be done decently and in order.
It's not finished until you've put the points on the board.
We have a purpose, and that's what we're trying to achieve this trophy, and that's where we stay focused.
I said before, I'd focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what's on the side - the best players in the world."
Excited by his players playing in the poor golf course, Bjorn added: "I'm not going to lead myself here.
Tomorrow's another beast.
There will be open individual events, and there will be other activities.
It's good to go out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone, your golfing skills will be tested.
The message that you have to speak to the speaker must be given to everyone who can do so.
Now, leave your partner and she'll have to go and get everything she can out."
Compared to Bjorn, the reigning number-one Jim Furyk expects his players to play better individually than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at the end of several major changes on the last day, as he was part of the Brookline rescue team before losing to Europe when he proclaimed "Miracle and Medina."
"I remember every word here," he replied when he asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you can see in Brookline, as you can see in Medina.
When the bull goes in one direction, it carries a lot of pressure in the middle of the match.
We're doing our line-up according to what we need and we're getting players out because, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas managed the game award and Rory McIlroy was ahead of the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter among other Europeans at the top half of the line-up.
"That's why I've made this group of players sequence because I think it's the best until the end," Bjorn said to his selections for the singles.
Germany's new warships are being disbanded again
Germany's latest frigates to buy old warships from the Cold War had to be scrapped in 2014, but they will not be available until next year due to system flaws and rising costs, reports the local media.
The rise of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit which goes down a military spokesman said.
The ship was supposed to be in the Navy in 2014, but the major project was in trouble due to serious issues following the delivery.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be purchased by old Bremen-class frigates.
Clearly they had a powerful cannon, a range of missiles against the ship's armor and against the ship as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates that have been up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continued delay means that the latest warships - which Germany is said to be able to show off power across the ocean - will become old when the time comes for them to enter service, says Die Zeit.
The lucky F125 frigate headlined last year, when the German Navy officially boarded the ship and returned it to the ship's Blohm <0x26> Voss service in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the manufacturer after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have discussed some "defects of important software and hardware" that would make warships useless if they were deployed on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are especially important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships are being driven by a crew of 120 seamen - only half of the older Bremen-class frigates.
Moreover, the ship went out too early in the morning, decreasing its deployment and limiting the Navy's ability to add upgrades to the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships used by the Germans during the World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - has also become a problem.
It is said to reach a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - rising from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that surround the latest frigates are becoming increasingly important because of recent obstacles to the depletion of German naval power.
In the first half of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "depleted of ships that could be deployed."
The officer said that the issue had grown over time, as the old ships were removed but no purchases were given.
He pointed out that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates matched the Navy.
National Trust detects the secret life of frogs
New research is being carried out outside a estate in the Scottish Highlands that reveals how frogs use the landscape in their search for food.
It is expected to illuminate the behavior of strange flying mammals and help guide future care activities.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano pipistrelles as well as the long-eared brown panking and panking Daubenton at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Include special recorders in key locations around the kingdom to keep track of the activities of the raids throughout the season.
NHS staff and mobile survey volunteers also work with hand-held detectors.
Experts in sound analysis at all recordings will show the frequency of the sounds of the fish and which species make the most of the sounds.
Then, make a map of the premises to have a more detailed landscape-scale description of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, environmentalist for NTS, hopes to reveal the results of which areas of residence are most important to research and how they are used by each species.
This information helps us to understand the benefits of living space management, such as the creation of virtually anything, and what is the best way to inject trees for frogs and other related specimens.
There has been a significant decline in the populations of mangroves in Scotland and across the UK over the past century.
They've been working on construction and development that affects nests and loss of housing.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a threat, including flypapers and some chemicals manufactured by building materials, as well as attacks by cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their night hunting behavior their ears were more helpful than their eyes when it came to closure.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to adapt insects and obstacles to the path that they encounter.
It is important to the NTS, which is responsible for the preservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country.
It has trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, to inspect nests and sometimes nightmares.
The organization has established the first and only reserve of land for the Scottish frigates at Threave estates in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species.
Property manager David Thompson says the estate is the best territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a good place for frogs," he said.
"We have an old house, a lot of old trees and all the great places to live.
But there's not much more to know about the forest, so it helps us do here and others to understand what they need in order to survive."
He appreciates the importance of checking for pre-meditation precautions because it's possible that even a single mother's nest could kill 400 women and children, possibly entangling the entire local population.
The frogs are protected and are in violation of the law to kill, toss or toss them or toss their nests.
Scottish Bat Conservation Trust official Elisabeth Ferrell has urged the public to help.
He said: "We're going to learn more about our fisheries and we don't know the population density of many of our species."
Ronaldo hasn't ignored the demands of labor while lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the campaigners against him a "truth," saying people "like to lie to themselves" by his name.
His lawyers are alleged to have sued the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which circulated the allegations.
The forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused by American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
While chatting with an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers a few hours after the parade was posted, Ronaldo, 33, said the reports were "news reports."
"No, no, no, no, no.
It's fake what they said today," he told the camera five times winning the Ballon d'Or.
"They want to fool themselves with my name.
It’s normal.
They wanted to be famous, so they talked about my name, but it was just a job.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable pending of information on the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Prosecutor Christian Schertz said the player would weave a fee for "a moral error at the equivalent of a morning of intrusion, which may have been one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga return to the player's room, where he harasses the woman, according to papers submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo knelt after the incident and told him he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who was hit by "one percent."
Documents suggest that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had returned, but they both liked it.
Mayorga also said that he would go to the police and take pictures of his wounds at a hospital, but the play would go along with an arrangement because he was "fearful of rewards" and said he was "embarrassing to the public."
The 34-year-old says he needs to reverse the arrangement because he is still traumatized by the planned incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse, and this day skipped the Italian giants Juve on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: 'Long live UK regrets' loss of car manufacturers
The UK's "living regret" if it loses its reputation as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK said it would be "devastating" to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal it will temporarily focus on production at its Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
Japan says it is making cars that the impact of delays on the border if there is no Brexit deal could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - has produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year and 90% of them are exported to other parts of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March production will be cut off from our work," said Marvin Cooke, chief director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK are evading their fears of moving to the EU without an agreement on how to handle speeds at the borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say poses a threat to the supply chain when there is no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis where parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for vehicles made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border disruption that industry says could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to accumulate more than one day’s inventory value at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production could be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "prepared to avoid such border investigations."
"We need to have an agreement. We want the best deal to be in place not only for the readers to be successful at the moment but for us to benefit from this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Based on the evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers, we need to be able to fully resume any highly successful supply chain."
Toyota can't say how long it will take to stop production, but it's important that in a respectful time, the additional costs of the plant's capacity to co-operate and in the future lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working for Burnaston for 24 years and who is a Unite union convenor at the plant, said: "In my experience, once lost, these jobs can never be restored.
A government spokesperson said: "We've come up with an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's talk could be lost again, according to the White House
Donald Trumpat's meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "an extravagant one more week" as the problem with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continued, according to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein cites the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the press, with Trump and Russia's aides and possibly the president's impeachment of justice.
For months, Trump has been talking about whether to appoint the deputy attorney general, and whether you want Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wiring to record Trump's conversations and the possibility of the president's dismissal by the 25th.
Rosenstein passed the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was going to cry.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not" Rosenstein but preached the talks to avoid hearing the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-off FBI investigation of protesters against Kavanaugh, which delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders passed away on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about speaking to Rosenstein, he said: "There's no set date for it, maybe it's going to be too late, maybe it's going to be another week because of all the other things that take place in the Supreme Court.
But let's take a look and I'll keep the press up-to-date."
Several reporters followed his statement: Sanders had not held a press briefing at While House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders noted that the shortage of briefings was not due to the dislike of TV reporters, but he said: "I don't oppose that they're actually detracting."
Then, he pointed out that there was a direct link between Trump and the press.
"The president does more Q<0x26>A sessions than those before him," he said, adding that there was no written proof: "We'll see these numbers."
There will be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States himself, it's better 'to talk to me.
We're trying to do it a lot and you've seen us doing it a lot over the last few weeks and it's changing the press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly receives questions when leaving the White House or engages in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
It is rare for single press conferences.
In New York today it's been shown by the president why, to show a lack of formality and sometimes a strange appearance in front of reporters.
Secretary of State of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland on Brexit fears
The EU Secretary of State is waiting for people working with the NHS of Scotland to express their gratitude and urge them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter saying it would take less than six months until the UK returned from the EU.
The Scottish Government has promised to meet the value of applications for settled status for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In his letter, Ms Freeman said: "Last day, the dialogue between the UK and EU on departures continued, hopefully there will be decisions now.
But the UK government has also tightened its preparations for a possible deal.
I know it's a terrible time for all of you.
So I'd like to repeat today how important it is for me to contribute to every person, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from all over the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experiences and skills that improve and improve the service environment, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
There's no doubt Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Under Emergency Operation After Head Pain
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a loss on Saturday at Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ's report from Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the incident happened shortly before halftime.
"He'll go to the sideline and just crash there," said Reed.
Abercrombie was given oxygen by trainees and sideline medical professionals before she was placed in a stretcher and taken for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds that there are "no more details on the type of paint" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out where the paint went.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, was in her first season at Tennessee State after coming from Illinois.
He had five round tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
UK royalty buyers are exempted from higher stamp duty
Buyers will be forced to buy higher stamp duty when they buy UK royalties and use the money to help the uninsured under Tory's new plans.
The steps are an antidote to Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
Stamp duty increases to non-taxpayers in the UK
The Yemeni government expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the unemployed.
Youngsters are set to buy higher stamp duty when they buy a royal in the UK - and use the extra money to help the uninsured, Theresa May is advertising it today.
The steps will be addressed as an antidote to Jeremy Corbyn's desire to entice young voters to make promises that will give them the best possible way to live and target big audiences.
Stamp duty will be raised on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money will be used to support the Government's desire to improve sleep on the street.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, among the higher levels implemented two years ago - is likely to be increased by three percent.
The Yemeni Brotherhood is expected to save this step up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new property is being bought by non-UK residents, raising prices if it makes it harder for people to buy homes for the first time.
There are a lot of places in the country - especially in the capital - that have become "host towns" because there are so many bargains that the country hasn't been around for a lot of time.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson decided to cut stamp duty to help young adults buy their first home.
He commissioned the large construction company for the continued high price of the estate by purchasing land but it was not used, and made Mrs. May to cover the quotas of the houses to fix the "silent housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of appealing housing reforms, including controlling the rent and releasing of evictions for "no reason".
He also wanted to give councils greater powers to build new houses.
Says Mrs. May: "Last year I said I would nominate my premiership in reviving the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing up the troubled housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and live here.
However, it's not easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes like a british resident.
The dream of having a house has become so far removed from too many people, and the indigestion of sleeping on the street continues to be a real problem."
Jack Ross: 'My ambition above all is to rule Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says that his "ambition above all" is to become Scotland's ruler someday.
Scots, 42, have the challenge of relaunching the North-East club, which is currently in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He made his way to the Stadium of Light this morning after the return of St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I like to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and it always seemed like someone was calling me back.
So, that opportunity will come only if I succeed in managing the club."
Along with his predecessors Ross as Sunderland's manager Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet at Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he is not afraid to follow the popular names of the club at that time, after offering offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this moment will be based on 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the hundreds and facilities of this club, there's no doubt it's in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but maybe I'll just tell myself that I'll be successful if I get the club back there."
Ross was only three years in his management career, becoming assistant boss at Dumbarton and part of Hearts' 15-month coaching staff.
Subsequently, he helped Alloa recover from the twelfth tier, and changed St Mirren from the twelfth tier to win the Championship title the following season.
Ross said he feels more comfortable now than he has ever played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a good thing," he recalled about the management of Alloa.
"I really believe that governance is suited to me, more than play.
It's kind of weird because I'm playing well, I'm making a living here, and I'm enjoying the wasted time.
But it was difficult to play.
You've got a lot of things to go through each week.
I still had to ‘go through the stresses and pressures of the job, but it was the right thing to do.
I've always dreamed of managing and now I'm doing this, it's the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt for myself in my entire life as a proper elder."

According to the sarbey, 5:30pm Saturday is the best time for a pint.
A very hot day has raised sales of impoverished pubs in Britain but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales of pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July - but sales in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Business consultancy CGA's Peter Martin said that he would stick with the figures: "The continued rise of the sun and the longer the expected England World Cup rally was expected to follow in July, when pub sales increased by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were more favorable.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant sales in June was growing in July.
The sale of pubs and bars to drink has been a major one, and if it's two seasons, it's bigger than what restaurants drop.
It's also not good for the pubs that the main food is good, but it's not as bad as what restaurant operators have to say.
It's like people just want to go out and drink.
In the pubs and bars, the drink sales increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, and the food sales dropped by three per cent."
Paul Newman of the RSM survey of leisure and hospitality said: "These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of the massive social event or opening up has been the most masculine factor affecting the market advantages of those outside their homes.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a 4.8 percent drop in sales every year will be even more painful when it adds to the ongoing pressure of spending.
It's not nice to have a long warm day for food operators and only time can tell if the situation will be cleared when the colder temperatures we're going through in August."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, will be 2.7 percent in July, prompting a change in brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industry tracker for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, is collecting and analyzing performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and this is the industry-leading basis.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they do not share with their parents

One out of five children - some 11-year-olds - are making social media accounts that they keep secret from those who know them.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - referring to Instagram's photo-sharing site.
News has compared fears of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have clean "management" accounts shown to parents, while they also have private accounts.
A mother who accidentally saw on the secret site of her 13-year-old son met a teenager who told other people to "assign me."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's a shame that so many teenagers are attracted to creating online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "boss for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle is known to the board of Scottish Athletics as the non-executive director of the annual general assembly of the government branch.
Doyle, the track and field athlete in Scotland with the most experience and leader Ian Beattie has described the step as a great opportunity for gamers to benefit from his extensive global experience over the past decade.
"There is great respect for Eilidh in the sports communities in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit greatly from bringing him to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am interested in standing up as the voice of athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta along with his total four gold medals at the Olympics and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after having a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: "This month since I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said it was only time that I could tell if I was successful or what level.
It's a hard job but I'm totally moving, I'm learning how to walk again and now I'm exercising to be agile!
Thank you for the message of courage!"
Heart the opinion on the internet about advertising for breast pump which compares mothers to cows
Breast pump companies share their opinion on the internet because of the advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows.
To mark the launch of what they call "the world's first silent breast pump," the company Elvie released a satirical music video advertising to showcase the freedom that the new pump gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a stall full of straw with lyrics like: "Yeah, I'm milking myself but I can't see you" and "If you haven't noticed I don't think about it, I'm breasts like that."
The chorus continued: "You're going to make me milk my babies, you're going to make me milk my boobs, you're going to make me milk my babies, you're going to make me milk my boobs."
But advertising has sparked controversy over the internet, which has already been posted on the company's Facebook page.
There are 77,000 people who have listened to and commented in advance, and have received videos of cautious reactions from audiences, and many say that they are pushing those who are "interfering" in the dairy industry.
"The decision to use cows to advertise the product is definitely not a good one.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, so they're just going to have their breasts removed a few days after they're born," said one.

Another comment: "Traumatic understanding for mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise the breast pump for mothers who are not far from their babies?"
Another added: "There's no shortage of advertising."
While others indulged in advertising, a woman admitted that the song was "laughing" for her.
"That's a good idea for me.
I would have bought it if I were still breastfeeding.
It's just that I really feel like I'm pumping.
Advertising is a bit different too, but I think it is.
It's a product," said one.
Another commented: "It's a horrible advertisement for mothers who pump up and feel like "cows."
It's not advertising to praise or advise the dairy industry."
Because of the video, the group of women reveals that they are all dancing with invisible pumps inside their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, no wires or tubes and fits inside a nursing bra that is not noticeable, so the more the women are moving, the more they are able to relieve their babies, and the more they get out of the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner at Mother's ECD, commented: "The Elvie Pump has changed so much that it should be given a bold and stimulating launch.
Compared to the pumping women and cows we like to call pumping milk and all the hard things about it, while showing in the exciting and first-hand way the great relief with the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has become the head of the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two-year-old children ran for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Old Migrant Child Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children is rising despite the unchanged monthly marginalization of the border, partly because it has become harder to place children in sponsors as a result of the harsh rhetoric and rules enacted by the Trump administration.
Typically, most sponsors have also become undocumented immigrants, and are afraid to put their own barriers to staying in the country when they accept a child.
The risk is heightened in June, when federal authorities declared it necessary to submit fingerprints to potential sponsors and other senior members of their constituents, and share data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unemployed children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of individual sponsors or members of the best sponsors are in a country that violates the law, and a large part of them are criminals.
So we're going to keep track of those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
For children to be processed faster, officials have enacted new rules for them to go to court within a month of the cadet, instead of 60 days, according to the shelter staff.
Many have been approached by video conference calls, rather than personal, to explain their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who do not qualify for help are quickly deported.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to annoyances or escapes, according to shelter workers and reports from the system in just a few months.
Supporters say that the odds are better compared to a larger facility like Tornillo, where the signs that a child is struggling are likely to go unnoticed, because of its size.
They add that moving children to a tent city that doesn't give them enough time to prepare for their emotions or to say goodbye to friends may exacerbate the trauma experienced by many.
U.S., France and Turkey's 'subordinate forces' told Syria to leave immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that it was against the law to pass through Syrian forces, justify the fight against terrorism, and "to be expected accordingly."
"They have to leave immediately and without any condition," he said to the assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the fight against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more need to be evacuated from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "develop the sacred battle until all of Syria's territory is removed" both terrorist groups and "any presence of anti-terrorism laws."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and leading Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs to fight President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were good for them to return, and he criticized "their western country" for "spreading fearlessness" that surrounded the refugees to stay away.
"We have already called on the global community and outreach organizations to facilitate these restorations," he said.
"They're trying to get the whole job done."
The United States and the European Union vowed that there would be no reconstruction assistance for Syria until a political deal between Assad and the opposition ended the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity to resume political dialogue.
Under the Russian-Turkish agreement, a large-scale offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province was avoided, with three million people left.
However, Moualem denied that the deal had "clear vicissitudes" and expressed the hope that military action would be targeted by jihadists including those from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who were "confused."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new government committee and opposition members to write a permanent law after the war on Syria and to prolong the peace process.
Moualem put the terms for Syria's government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current foreign affairs," and worrying about interference.
Why Trump Won the Terms of Judgment
In that log, Mr. Trump is again in the process of 2020 except, as many liberals would expect, if his presidency were to end with repression and scandal.
In an unmistakable "The most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
Nowadays, there are no signs of weariness in the audience.
As of 2014, prime-time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly triple to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led cable ratings to 3.5 million viewers in the evenings of big news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, running the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol collapsed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and co-writer of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has other theories.
He remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 shuttle.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Cause she's laughing at me,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
The confusion was distracting.
Of course, unlike others on TV, stories from Washington can affect the future of Roe v. Wade, when immigrant families are reunited, and the health of the global economy.
The one who doesn't listen is a luxury that the best viewer can do.
But beyond being a smart citizen when you're six hours in the audience of a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," on Paul Manafort's <0x24>15,000 bomb jacket made of wild ostrich, Mr. Trump's "excessiveness," the post says.
If I were you, I'd think Super Mario would be different.
"What he's doing so for this reality show is because he's having something to show you tonight," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and co-founder of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's rotating film cast and the day-to-day change in the story.
You'll be left behind if you ignore an epidural.
When I approached Mr. Fleiss, who was about 80 degrees tall, outside his house on the Kauai coast, he was inside watching MSNBC while re-recording CNN.
He could not leave the show, much less Brett Kavanaugh was set to join the Senate Judiciary Committee and hang the next day of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we were doing some amazing shows back then and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss said to me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Money from outside is falling in Congress' toughest fight in midterm elections
It's not surprising to make cash in Pennsylvania's 17th, thanks to changes in congressional districts that have resulted in a feud between two current co-chairs for the same position.
The Pittsburgh district has recently been reshaped with Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won a seat in another district at a special event this spring.
Lamb is running against Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing Pennsylvania's 12th district, who was actually raised by the new 17th.
Maps were drawn again after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's injunction in January that old districts had been reddening outlaws in favor of Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th has started a campaign battle for funding between the main party's branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became familiar with Pennsylvania after winning a very short run in March, which was widely studied for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The Republicans have held the seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats little.
U.S. Balancing El Salvador With Support for China, Aftermath
Diplomats who have recognized the Dominican Republic and Panama have sanctioned Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a meticulous conversation with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners overthrew the top of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to bring back American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions that Taiwan is no longer known," department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties against El Salvador, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, include narcotics controls, development support and the economy.
The sanctions, which involve financial aid and visa-targeted restrictions, are only severe for the country in Great America and at a high level of unemployment and deaths there.
As inner-city talks were coming down, officials in North America and North America held a high-level conference focused on security and economic development to follow the same-sex talks a year ago that were designated as an advanced step to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by the middle of September, high-ranking administration officials have come to the conclusion that they want the summit to continue, ending with any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was able to speak at the conference, which will be held in mid-October, as a sign of the administration's appreciation for the gathering, diplomats said.
And the three American orders are quietly returning to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new strict message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton yesterday commented on details of the debate depicted by three American officials, including two diplomats, discussing internal conversations on the condition that they were not named.
Their accounts were written by an outsider from the east near the administration and also spoke on condition that he was not named.
Let's learn the history
The next thing to happen is the report by special counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice, which has so much evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller said in the report that his investigation into whether Trump's campaign against Russia was involved in the attack on our law.
If something changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will look forward to the discussion at this branch, as he prepares to camp again, and perhaps in the future to a jury composed of his fairnesses.
A lot of that, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable--or his integrity to Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have a lot of decisions to make that will affect how long the singularity is.
In 1938, German officials were able to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if he were to be punished by the West and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We got caught, and the opportunity was surpassed to avoid the next three years of witchcraft.
The course of history revolves around these points of change in direction, and the unprecedented progress of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans are facing some of these points of change now.
What would we do if Mr. Trump were to replace Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein is unlikely to have begun waiting for the paper last year, but he has been silent about the president's re-recording and has given up speculation that the president hasn't won the position.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' account is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I.'s recent inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he can be confirmed before the Supreme Court in the face of false allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, would we vote in the midterms for a Congress that would annoy Mr. Trump?
If we fall through those trials, the winter of democracy will endure.
But I believe that we are not in trouble, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who would occasionally invade my home as an ambassador.
He survived, went to America and, 60 years later, lit the candles of the Sabbath on that swastika-marked table with me.
Since I have that manna, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorns of Rangers optimistic about coming up against Rapid Vienna
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, mastering the victory against the Austrians, following Spain's impressive table against Villarreal in the first half of this month, putting them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury stopped midfielder Graham Dorrans from going through the season to 2-2 on Villarreal but he believed the Rangers could use the result as a warning to the bigger thing.
"It's a good point for us because Villarreal is a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game believing that we could have something and came out with points.
We may have just gotten into the band late but, on the whole, the board may have been a good result.
Maybe they were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
On Thursday, another big night in Europe.
I hope we get three points but the game is going to be tough because they got a good result in their last game, but we're backed by people, so I'm sure we'll fight and get a positive result.
Last year was really hard, in everything that happened to my mistakes and the changes in the club itself but there was a good feeling in the area right now.
The group was great and the members really enjoyed themselves; the training was great.
We hope that we can fight today, we can defend the previous season and be successful."
Women are stunned by the fear of retiring
In spite of the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only people were talking to members of their families about it.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their wives about the value of respectful care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to take care of them by a family member, but they don't make it a point to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide life insurance business.
Here it can start.
Take care of your wife and children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't say your wishes early.
Talk to your employer and your family about where and how we receive care, because these decisions are big things to be worth.
Take your finance manager: you'll also help your finance manager find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your choices of funding for respectful care may be part of a traditional insurance policy for respectful care, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help meet these expenses or insure yourself with your own money - if you have money.
Fix your legal documents: Try to avoid legal problems.
You need to have a proxy for help so that you can be trusted with your medical care and that professionals follow your preferences if you don't speak up.
Think about having a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and your bills will be paid when you can't.
Don't forget the small details: Think of your elderly brother as a medical emergency and going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about roots and allergies?
The details are brought into a written plan for you to be ready.
"Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the roots?
Who's going to take care of the smoke?
You have to prepare that plan."
Male binary multiple times air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man has been barred several times with an air rifle as he walks home one night.
The victim, in her 40s, was in Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, stomach and hands.
Officials described the incident, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "extraordinary kilograms."
The victim didn't see the bullet in him.
His wounds were not life-threatening and the police appealed to eyewitnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the quake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials say, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Because the lines of communications were broken, officials of aid agencies from Donggala regency, a small area near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were unable to obtain any information.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the completion of the vaccine.
Here are some basic information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the provincial capital of Central Sulawesi, located on the southwest coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating its 40th anniversary after an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regency with more than 300 km (180 miles) of seaside in the far west of the island of Sulawesi.
The population was estimated to be 299,200 in 2017 by the regency, which is an administrative region lesser in the province.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic hub of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal Donggala region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of it is in Morowali, along the coast of Sulawesi.
Tsunami has hit Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the deaths of more than 200 people and the destruction of a road home in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, and nine people died.
Indonesia is on the slopes of the Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly experiences earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of massive earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast in the last part of March and the first part of April.
He died prematurely on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hits south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami hitting the coastline, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the provincial capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that struck dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing devastation and fear as people remember the devastation caused by the massive 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The tsunami did not follow, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of the building.
2018: A massive earthquake hits the remote tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the southern part of the island.
The earthquake struck tens of thousands of people, and thousands of tourists were placed on the scene.
Sarah Palin's Firstborn Arrested at Family Violence Centers
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for alleged harassment.

Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terror attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a Home Depot truck to carry out a cycling road attack along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, which will take people walking and cycling on its path in October.
To compensate for the death counsel, the investigators had to prove that Saipov's "sadness" to have eight victims killed and that he was "sad" to have serious bodily injury, according to the announcement of the intention to impose the death penalty, which was handed out in the New York District.
Both of these sentences are likely to be sentenced to death, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury filed a lawsuit against Saipov for 22 counts including eight death row support for extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and accused of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the investigators, the attack required "mild preparation and planning," and described Saipov's approach here as "dummal, delicate and eccentric."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has inflicted pain, pain and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Paguncco," he said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the First District of New York was prosecuted for the death penalty.
Khalid Barnes was sentenced to death by two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were hanged after they were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years ago.
Rosenberg was hanged in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show any delay in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was pleased with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the court.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He did not admit the guilt in the 22nd.
David Patto, one of the federal public spokespersons to meet Saipov, said they were "disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to end the death penalty rather than accepting the admission of a life sentence for imprisonment without the possibility of release will only last the traumatic consequences of these events at all costs," Patton said.
The defendants of Saipov's defense were first tried by the defendants not to be sentenced to death.
NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations with Tory MP
Nigel Farage vowed to 'remove the army' today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that what politicians need is 'pressure' from Eurosceptics - while one of Theresa's MPs insists she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at a march in Birmingham that the UK would 'go away' if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces in order to agree on her heart group has been shattered by the Tory's involvement in favor of staying in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
It's hard for the premier to keep his Chequers compromise plan tight amid attacks from Brexit Favorites, who want to stay in the EU.
Allies are pressuring that he will continue to try to have a deal with Brussels in the face of an unfavorable reaction - and forcing Eurosceptic and Labour to choose between his plan and the 'disturbance'.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally at Solihull that he wanted to 'throw away the Chequers'.
He said Mr. Farage had to be a peer and was given responsibility for negotiations in Brussels.
'If he were to take over, we'd be out now,' he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit but we need to scrap the Chequers.'
Excluding his objection to the EU, he said: 'We don't fight against global rivalries just to be a succession.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone dismissed the criticism that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is not entirely true.'
Tory Favorite Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: 'What I'm saying is: Prime Minister, you listen to people.
'The Chequers don't want the public, they don't want the Opposition to vote, they don't want our party and our activists who walk the streets and pay us respect.
Just please, forget the Chequers and start listening.'
In a marketing message to Mrs. May, she added: 'Prime ministers will remain in office if they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage said rally politicians would have to 'pressure' if they planned to circumvent the decision that would take place in the 2016 referendum.
'It's about now that we can trust - people - and our politicians,' he said.
'They're trying to circumvent Brexit and we're here to tell them that 'we don't let you do that'.'
In a message to enthusiastic groups he added: 'I want you to feel the pressure on our politicians, that Brexit is going to turn around.
'We're moving the army of people in this country that gave us the victory over Brexit and we won't stop until we are free, self-governed, high-ranking United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, people who wanted to stay up to Birmingham marched before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Activists have set out to wave Tory Anti-Brexit banners after the group launched this weekend.
Labour co-founder Lord Adonis blamed the Conservatives for security issues they drew at a party app to open the conference.
'It's the people who are telling us they can put together IT systems and all technology for Canada and more, for no border crossing, for the freedom without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It's just laughing.
"There's nothing better than Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'think carefully' run for presidency
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said it would be "a good idea to think about running for president" after November's run.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat had discussed his future in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state-run Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
He is already in the midst of speculation that he will be fighting Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon in Holyoke his 36th meeting with the public in town hall format began when Trump sat down.
One of the leaders asked him if he wanted to run for president.
Warren says it's time for "women to go to Washington to improve our government, and a woman here as president."
Someone has been arrested after the death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La. announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting and killing of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. news conference of ET.
They released a video of the film on Friday, asking for help to identify the man on the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University's campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a bullet in the head that killed him," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde hangs up his friend and Simpson rapes him.
Simpson asked and admitted that he was in the crime scene, had a hand sanitizer, and admitted that he had raped Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior growing up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears world title after team orders win from Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's career order would play a major role.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton in his defensive position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to present his teammate.
Vettel first stopped in the pit and left Hamilton going into traffic at the end of the group, something that must have been fixed on the result.
Mercedes knocked out a lap and came out of Vettel's back, but Hamilton came ahead after a scuffle in which the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inside for free to continue for forgiveness after the double-move for forgiveness in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started off at the bottom of the grid and was seventh in the band due to the first lap on his 21st birthday.
Afterwards, he led a big part of the career as he continued to run to target a quick finish and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
He stopped pit on the 44th lap but was unable to accelerate his lap on the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took the fourth.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and really became a gentleman and took me in.
The team has done amazingly well to have one-two," said Hamilton.
“The Lord’s Work Is Real”
President Donald Trump jailed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president indirectly approved the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "cruel and ugly and liars."
"One thing that can happen and good things happen in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people being angry and cruel and evil and lying," he said.
"When you see the outputs and outputs and they say "ah, I'm not doing that.
I'm not the one doing that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you the one who baptized?
Remember his answer... Were you the one who baptized the document--"ah, ah, what?
Ah, no.
I didn't get baptized."
Wait a minute.
Did we reveal...No, we didn't baptize," he added, as the senator cheered.
Feinstein received a letter detailing allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and was baptized in the first half of September - but Feinstein claimed that his office had been baptized.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't spark his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill report.
"He looked at me to keep it confidential and that's how I did, just as he asked."
But his previous speech to the president was not pleasant, commenting at the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, really bad body movement's like that.
He probably didn't, but 'that's the most common body movement I've ever seen.'
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president said the Democrats were using allegations for their own benefit.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see the weakness, the evil, they don't care who gets hurt, who they can afford to get power," the Mediaite president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored a goal for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars returned to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a 5-3 win in the return match for Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored just two early goals by strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie crossed the home side before Dwyer returned only the Giants.
Francois Bouchard set up the game for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals.
It was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who started from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth appearance of the season on both sides, winning the Giants in the last three games.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, and David Rutherford gave an assist while Beauvillier could not wait for four minutes.
In the losing opening period, Sullivan returned home side to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie's tackle at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure to lead the Giants on the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home side again met and Bouchard again passed them with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen to give Dundee only for the first time in the last half of the second period and ensured his team's fifth halfway win until the final.
The Giants, now three out of four of their last five games, will return and visit Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies after plane crashes to save life
An Indonesian air traffic controller was called a hero after he died while a plane carrying a heavy load of people could fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
A massive aftershock continued to cover the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the Palu city.
But as his colleagues walked out to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat at the rising control tower at Pearl Sis Al Jufri Airport at Palu airport.
She left to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at those moments, could fly safely.
Later, he jumped into the traffic control tower when he thought he was upset.
He died in the hospital on the farm.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could save the life expectancy, reports Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikupapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
He died in the early hours of the morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are shaken by this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, as according to the country's disaster mitigation agency, access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number will rise because there are more bodies under the rubbish building while others will not be able to reach," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves of up to six yards smashed the Palu into the crowded area on Sunday.
Military and commercial transports are also bringing aid and support.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
There is not enough clean water.
The little shop was robbed all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross is in contact with Indonesia to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can go on."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to end every act of fraud.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was marked in the first part of this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesian plane crashes: Air Niugini says a man is missing after plane crashes into a lake
The airline is now saying that a plane crashed into the Pacific lake in Micronesia with a man missing, after first saying that all 47 passengers and people were safely escaped from a falling plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that on Saturday afternoon, a male passenger would not be found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats are helping to rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to cross the Chuuk island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in good condition.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
A fellow airliner and the U.S. Navy said that the plane was passing through the lake and did not arrive on the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought that the plane passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It's a really good thing 'that's it," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that she and other passengers had been able to walk through the water until it was cleared to emergency exits on the falling plane.
He said frightened and screamed at the flight attendants, and that he had a small headache.
The U.S. Navy said it would also help rescue marines who had fixed the port near by using a canoe to get people into the water before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in the crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades but that Air Niugini has not yet been involved.
You set the timeline of the night that a woman is alive.
The prosecution concluded its argument on Saturday to re-politicize a man accused of living with a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Tagasuri of the U.S. Department of Justice testified that Paul Rowlett had been an expert witness for hours in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cellphone records to cut the pounds of 29-year-old perfect Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night of his death.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cell phones showing Tellis with Chambers on the night of her death, which was in violation of Tellis' earlier statement, Clarion Ledger's report.
When data showed that the man's cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police contacted Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was somewhere else that day.
When asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is Tellis's statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks after his death.
According to cell phone records, they only met for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis broke Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information on his phone.
"He cut the girl out of her life," said Hale.
The defense was set to begin its spurious arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected to go to the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The three hip hop wanted to achieve a negative view of the genre by incorporating positive messages into their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that hip hop stays away from the roots of the political message and addresses social issues.
They wanted to go back to their roots and recapture the conscious hip hop.
Again artists such as The Fugees and Common have been popularized in the UK by artists such as Think and Lowkey.
It's black again?!
An aunt in NY sued a couple for quitting him after a racist text message.
A New York babysitter sued the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a false text message from a mother complaining that she was "an orphan again."
The couple argued that they were racists, and compared the prosecution to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who has two children, expressed disappointment that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was a black one when she arrived on her first day at work in 2016.
"HINDIIIIIIIIIIIII ITIM NAME," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman in her text to his wife.
So, instead of sending it to his wife, he was able to send it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After noticing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman "sensible" Ms. Maurice, saying that her former granddaughter, an African-American, was not a good job, and that she expected to be a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day at work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice sued the couple for a job loss, and demanded <0x24>350 a day for a six-month, stay-in job, like no contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple return to their racist ways, saying that Maurice's departure from work is reasonable, fearing that they can't trust him after hurting his feelings.
"My wife sent me a text she didn't really want to say.
He's not racist.
We're not racists," wife Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But do you trust your children with someone you're rude, even if you don't enjoy?
Your newborn baby?
It's not 'did' it."
Comparing the prosecution to "extortion," Plasco said just two months after his wife's birth and "is very difficult in the situation."
"You're imposing a man like that?
It's not that good," added the investment banker.
As the case progressed, the public quickly slammed the couple on social media, eradicating their habits and logic.
Paddton speakers are afraid that readers won't like the bear-speaking, baptism of new writing
Says about Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born untimely after receiving the book: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before it's published.
It's wonderful to know now what we know about the great success of Paddton."
Still believe even if his work is hidden, he says about his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before getting inspiration from a little bear to write a childhood book, and he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication came after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a "valuable member of our family," and he adds that his father is proud of the latter's success.
"He's a quiet man, and he's not shy," she said.
"But because Paddton is real for her, it's like your son gets something: you're proud of them even though you don't have it.
I think that's what he thinks of Paddton's success.
As much as it was in his imagination and imagination, he gave the honor to Paddton himself."
I said goodbye to the phone while my son was dying
After a fall his son was thrown at the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, which he touched but failed to save his life.
"Call Nad now to say that he is really dear, that there is no hope of his life," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he would die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
‘And that’s what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, son.
I won't be there for long.
We're together.
Little by little, he was exhausted from his body and lost the roots that doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping.
He died before this and 'then everything was shut down.
I can't do anything but sit there and wait, as I know it's all going on.
I couldn’t shout or cry because there were so many families and people around me.
I need to get it all out."
In the meantime, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was rushing on her son's journey, was on a plane with the other passengers - who were homeless in her driveway.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I just nodded, there was no stopping to cry.
It was hard to explain, but on the plane I felt a sense of compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I know she loves the baby."
Female middle-aged women throw out cards to block bridge tenders
Two of the women who lost their loved ones to death were hugging others to keep them from dying as well.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys live on the Welsh bridge of cards with messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when she began to develop depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"Any older brother can't feel what I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son hopes to be a chef with a comforting smile.
"She knows everything because of her smile.
They always say that his smile makes me happy."
So he quit his job before he died, because he was "sorely depressed."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother saw his brother after his death.
Ms. Davis said, "I've always been concerned that it's going to have an impact."
Ms. Davis draws out the cards, "to tell people that there is something to go and they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet - you need someone to talk to."
Ms. Humphreys, a friend of Ms. Davies's for several years, was abandoned by Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after her mother's departure.
"He didn't say he was upset or depressed or anything," he said.
"Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
She's sad about Christmas Day--when the children opened their gifts she didn't go with them."
She said that her death was traumatic to them, but they had to accept it: "The family has a lot of control.
We were horrified.
But we all have to go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh was hanged the next day as the FBI investigated
"I think, if we can do anything like he wants - an investigation in a limited time, the scope is limited - there will be even a little bit of solitude," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared he was "understood" that the committee was at the center of the party's impeachment.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They're paying attention because of all the time.
Five weeks of midterm elections, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans are unsuccessful, they will be too weak in their attempts to sell what they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush called the Senators, speaking to them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and by this he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI does this report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to resolve the board of votes and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Defector's Number 'depleted' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un sat down for seven years, says a South Korean frontier.
While discussing data from South Korea's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug said that there were 1,127 defects last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said it's a big deal to have tighter border controls between North Korea and China and a higher payload of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not given any public comment.
Most of North Korean defectors are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have returned to the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are flown by China, which has the lowest border in North Korea and is much more accessible than the tightly protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China has cited defectors as illegal immigrants to instead of refugees and has often been forced to repatriate them.
It's been a long time this past month between North and South -- which in fact is still hostile.
On the first part of this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks that had been studied in recent negotiations related to denuclearization.
It comes after historic June talks between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on the terms of the nuclear-free Korean peninsula agreement.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho cracked down on U.S. sanctions for a lack of usability since then.
"Without trust in the US, there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation, we would never have managed to disarm first," Mr Ri said in a statement to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has called Brett Kavanaugh a "very competitive," unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a "gentleman" and said that because of her behavior she should not serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks at an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if a woman is going to be like that, they'll say 'very funny,'" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotionally charged with sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his concluding speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming at some point and crying while discussing his family and his high school years.
Because he also condemned the Democrats to the committee, he called allegations against him "grievous and coordinated flattery" that liberals angered Hillary Clinton's defeat at the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she could not serve the Supreme Court, because it showed that she was not in favor of the Democrats.
"I think he qualifies himself for those statements and the way he flirts with the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was appreciative when she asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if she could confirm, and if Democrats would get a majority in the Lower House.
"I'm going to say it -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, that means he shouldn't just be in the Supreme Court, but in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is presently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was designated a conservative judge.
In hearings for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This isn't the time to go to court with someone who's funny and who's looking at us and who's going to say, 'That's not good,'" said Pelosi.
And women need to use it.
It's a bleak, bleak moon and year of anger, and she can't let it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I think it's pretty common, isn't it?"
She continues, "A woman in a certain area helped me a lot, who said she was crying when she was angry, but she did the same thing when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And he went on.
I think it's pretty ‘so'."
Tears are being rinsed as a way of expressing anger because they are misunderstood first.
One of my clearest memories from my earlier jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I cried with unrelenting anger, was the burning of me in the collar of a much older woman--a stubborn manager of whom I was always afraid--and I was caught up to a staircase.
"You don't want them to see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy that you're crying."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Colorado Democrat congressman, has already worked with Gary Hart in his presidential run-ups.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart caught up with his wife in a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the fight, Ms. Schroeder, who was really disappointed, thought there was no reason for him not to run for president himself.
"It's not really a good idea to think 'that's it," he told me laughing 30 years later.
"Maybe seven more candidates, and they don't need another one.
One man called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign started for a long time, he was withdrawn from the fundraising, so he promised not to be involved in the contest unless he was able to save <0x24>2 million.
There is no victory in the battle.
He found that some of his supporters who would give <0x24>1,000 to men would only give him <0x24>250.
"Do you think they'll give me a break?" he asked.
When he agreed and announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was emotionally blown away - thanks to those who supported him, disillusionment with the system where money is so hard to cover and target voters instead of delegates, and resentment over gender discrimination - so he felt.
"Imagine I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder remembered how the press reacted to her.
"Think of Kleenex sponsoring me.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my gravel?
"Did he cry?"
How the U.S.-China conflict will develop in Beijing
The beginnings of the conflict between the U.S. and China are confusing, and as long as the fight is over, Beijing may be able to improve the gap between nations in respectful weather, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, released the first bill this year by taxing China's top exports of solar panels, iron and aluminium.
It is now the largest influx of new crops affecting the <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, which is actually taxing half of all U.S. imports from China.
Beijing is rewarded every time, the first time is to impose tariffs of five to ten percent on <0x24>60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to keep the U.S. on its every kilogram, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will ever fail in the near future.
To be a senior in Washington, it is necessary to give up on demands, but a prolonged bowing to the U.S. would be a disgrace to Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts also say that if Beijing moves smoothly, U.S. pressures will positively support China's long-term respectability by decreasing the level of ties between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would initiate economic cohesion in either of the two countries, is more dangerous than observers admit," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who studied Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for repatriation of refugees, says Foreign Minister
It says that Syria is ready for the refugees to return to their homes, and that seven of them will go back to their own country.
Speaking in front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions would improve.
"The situation is more stable and safe now thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
Rehabilitation authorities continue to operate in areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to bring everything back to normal.
There are all the conditions for the courageous return of refugees to the country where they have been displaced because of terrorism and the only years of economic activities that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN has estimated that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
And the six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime is open to help revive the fallen nation.
But he insisted that it would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that are pulling the net.
The Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe missed the 2018 Ryder Cup and lost to Team USA in a pressing score of 16.5 out of 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
Six successive U.S. wins in Europe and the Ryder Cup in Europe has not been held since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points they needed to win against the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson's tee-shot, which had difficulty with the entire tournament, fell into the water at par-3 16th hole, and he accepted the loss to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari turned around in all his rounds, and became a 1-to-4 player to have a 5-0-0 from the start of the current tournament format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5<0x26>4 by Europe's lowest ranking player, with Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World top-ranked player Dustin Johnson has fallen 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who may be in his last Ryder Cup game.
Eight Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia has been the most successful tournament of all time in his 25.5 career point.
"I don't usually cry but now I can't help it.
This guy's gotten tough.
So I'm grateful for Thomas and he chose me and he trusted me.
I'm glad I got the cup again.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to help," said Garcia, who became emotional, following success in Europe.
He passed on the responsibility of his fellow golfer John Ram to US golfer Tiger Woods 2<0x26>1 in the singles game last Sunday.
"I'm really proud that I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up listening to him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
An unusual statistic of one of the best players of all time, won 14 big titles just for Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled the entire weekend to find the fairways except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these people, they fight.
There was a moment this morning that we made Europe a little harder.
We fought.
Greetings to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
It's a lovely game of all his 12 players.
We'll be together again, I'll be cooperating with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move forward.
I love this 12-year-old, and it makes me happy to serve as a captain.
You're a real salute.
They're just better."
Red Tide Update: Decreased concentration of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows the overall decline in Red Tide concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the conditions for more bloom patches in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties have been raised - which are causing lower concentrations.
The Bloom of the Red Tide stretches 130 miles of coastline from the counties of western Pinellas to the mouth of Lee.
Patches can be seen about 10 miles from Hillsborough County, but are much smaller than last week.
The Red Tide was also observed in Pasco County.
The average concentration of Pinellas County in the past week, low to high concentration in Hillsborough County, background up to high concentration in Manatee County, background up to high concentration in Manatee County, background up to high concentration in Lee County and far away in the range of Sarasota County, background up to
Breathing operations in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties continue to be observed.
There was no reported irritation to breathe in Florida's Northwest last week.
