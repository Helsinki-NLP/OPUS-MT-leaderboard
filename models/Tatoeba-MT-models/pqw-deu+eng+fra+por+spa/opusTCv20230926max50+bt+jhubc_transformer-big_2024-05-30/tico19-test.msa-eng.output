Increased cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirm that, despite being at different levels depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on experiences from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their willingness to increase the number of patients with COVID-19 who will require health care, and in particular intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases from an unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent was the novel coronavirus now referred to as the acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Up to now it has been proven that about 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild illness, e.g. an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospital treatment while the remaining 6% of cases suffer from critical illness requiring intensive treatment.
The death toll of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared those countries to Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
Covid-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 experienced a further geographical and dynamic spread of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world at this time according to the country's dynamics.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Europe according to WHO's definition of cases.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on Jan. 24 among those returning from Wuhan, China's Hubei Province.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, of which between December 31, 2019 and including that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases notified in each country around the world, derived from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and UK, as well as compare that data to Italy.
As a proxy for the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we have calculated the cumulative incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural path of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period of 1 January–15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases notified for each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to the number of Italian cases for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
Covid-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend in the 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and then increased significantly around February 28, 2020 (Additional Materials).
This is largely driven by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK are showing a similar upward trend for the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional ingredients).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries compared to cases in Italy for the period January 31-15, 2020.
It emphasized that, as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported the same number of cases as Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 cases being notified is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and UK.
The observed cumulative incidence trend of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is spreading at the same rate in all countries.
While countries are at varying levels, diversity in national public health responses and case definitions may differ in different countries as well as different protocols for selecting patients who must be tested for COVID-19 authentication, including follow-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in Italy's affected regions described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA levels for only 6% and 1% cases, respectively (data is not shown).
However, the data should be collected in a systematic way to support current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a large variation in the availability of neat care and intermediate care beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that the country has more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios related to saturation of healthcare capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK for the spread of COVID-19 cases hospitalized associated with >90% risk exceeding the capacity of intensive care beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Given that so far cases have formed clusters in certain EU/EEA countries and the UK, as well as hospitals and intensive care units typically handle clear area concentration populations, information on cases and intensive care beds should be provided in the Nomination for regional units for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a gradual community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19-infected patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is currently taking place in the affected region of Italy.
As emphasized in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to slowing down the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with shifts from preventive approaches to reduction, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their responses appropriately if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists general health care measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity that countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If this fails, it is likely that other EU/EEA national health care systems will face an increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophic for humans.
Just like its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be spread from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and death rate than SARS but is more contagious and affects more people than teens and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about the emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive view of the rapidly evolving subject of research.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in understanding and eradicating the life-threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for Chinese people who are urged to stay at home throughout the holiday season and weeks after the outbreak of a novel viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that triggered severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 and the associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients allowed to return home and more than 3,000 deaths.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "number 1 public enemy" and has the potential to be stronger than violence.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 2000 papers have been published on COVID-19 including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the sequencing of the virus isolated from some patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in that new and rapidly growing subject area.
When appropriate, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease that stems from CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, triggered in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some other important questions.
CoV is traditionally considered to be a non-dangerous pathogen to humans, usually the cause of about 15% of the common cold.
However, in this century, we have twice discovered high-pathogenic human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which triggered epidemics of their origin in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with severe morbidity and mortality rates.
COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to China's National Health Commission.
Seven days later the CoV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first death toll from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic is spreading rapidly to cities, regions and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infections among healthcare staff were reported, indicating that human-to-human infections could occur.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was imposed a curfew with all public transport services suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which is considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the disease a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
Since the situation is developing rapidly, the final scope and severity of the disease is not yet ascertained.
As of February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients provides a more recent illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX<0x5F>rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects patients of all ages, but most are between 30 and 65 years old.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected patients are over 50 years of age, very few are under 20 years of age and only 14 people are infected under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 affects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 develops in clusters mostly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from start to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted RO is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people rose exponentially before Jan. 23, 2020, corresponding to the time of the mass movement before the Spring Festival in China.
The death rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, isolated viruses that contain a single thread of sensory RNA.
The virus can be divided into four genera, e.g., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, among all known alpha- and beta-CoV infecting humans.
Spike (S) surface glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) enzymes for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then membrane merger occurs.
The genus of viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after replicating the genus of viruses, the genome RNA is accompanied by surface glycoproteins and nucleocapsid protens forming a vesicle containing virions, which then join with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity in 10 clustered samples taken from the original site of the disease, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transfer electron microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in the thinnest part of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was found to be a recipient of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein for SARS-CoV-2 bound to ACE2 is weaker than SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new simple protein encoded by orf3b and a protein secreted encoded by orf8.
Orf3b for SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and have an IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any domain or functional motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported that the cyro-EM structure for human ACE2 is entirely at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in the complex with the amino carrier asis B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has both open and closed authentication, has been combined as a dimer and the ACE-BOAT2 complex can combine the two S proteins, which provide evidence for the identification and infection of CoVs.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for drug censorship to curb SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Origin and Middle Hosts
It is well known that both SARS-CoV and MERS Cov originated from bats and were transferred to humans respectively through ferrets and camels.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bats-SL-CoVZX45 and bats-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate hosts that help the virus to cross species barriers to infect humans remain unknown, and the path of transmission remains unclear.
Ji, et al., suggested snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans involving a homologous re-combination in the protein S.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolins - long-nudged ant-eating mammals that have always been used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of the genetic homology in CoVs found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
Yet, the 1% difference spread across the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, the final decision to obtain concrete evidence is awaiting (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SRAS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 45 days below 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, chlorophom, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively deactivate the virus.
The entire human population generally has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore considered vulnerable to novel viruses.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, the virus is first identified by the host's natural immune system through pattern identification receptors (PRRs) including receptors such as lectins of type C, receptors such as Toll (TLR), receptors such as NOD (NLR), and receptors such as RIG-I (RLR).
Although different pathways, the virus results in the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturity and type I interferon systhesis (IFNs) which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the macrocytosis of the antigen virus.
However, the protein N SARS-CoV can help prevent the virus from responding to the immune response.
Shortly thereafter, the immune response was adapted to the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B> T cells continue to kill virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help the defense cells.
CoVs can inhibit T-cell function by causing T-cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity including supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals in the body that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, as well as, in the worst case scenario, failure of some organs, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, based on early clusters, are more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidity and pregnant women.
Being common for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function is affected, they have a higher chance of becoming infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, usually 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as noted above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, while preventing those who are infected but have no symptoms of spreading the virus to others.
As is common practice, individuals exposed to, or infected by, the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the main and early symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied without any other symptoms or symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, dizziness, headaches, sore throat, rinorea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the patient's condition immediately increases to acute respiratory syndrome, septic jets, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of acute breathing and fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of family clusters and clusters resulting from spread from asymptomatic individuals.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also developed fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
Yet, 80% of them need respiratory assistance, far more than COVID-19 patients and are consistent with higher congestion by MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) are also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) are the main symptoms and breathing aids have been required for about 14%-20% of patients.
As of February 14, the COVID-19 death rate was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Comparatively, the death rate from SARS as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Earlier studies reported that R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with 95% interval confidence (CI) 5.71-7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
Comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality rates and RO of the disease are shown in Table 1.1.
The above numbers suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to transmit than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the two diseases.
Therefore, it is far more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Cluster startups often occur in the same family or from the same assembly or vehicle as cruise ships.
Patients usually have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with an infected person or patient in the past two weeks before starting to get sick.
However, it has been reported that patients can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and recovered patients who are allowed to return from the hospital can carry the virus again, which sends a warning to increase the time of quarantine.
The patient has a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at an early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/L including lymphocyte count <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia have been found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin have increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation have increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, has increased, and the count of lymphocytes has decreased significantly.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are indicated by bilateral patchy shadows or the opacity of soil glass in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, rapid fluid accumulation and fibrosis adversely affect gas exchange.
Type-I and type-II pneumocyte dysfunction reduces surfactant levels and increases surface tension, thereby reducing lung ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the discovery of poor chest radiography is usually parallel to the worst extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyalin membranes and the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes as well as multinucleic synthesis cells in the lungs of patients dying from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS and similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via a transcription-reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, as a result of high false negative rates, which may provoke an epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurs with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is important as well as the imperative to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group described the protol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects fragments of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA at 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L to 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies of each input microliter) using a dip rod in less than an hour without requiring complicated equipment.
Hopefully the new technique can significantly improve sensitivity and convenience if confirmed in clinical samples.
As a result of lack of experience with novel CoVs, doctors can generally provide supportive treatment to COVID-19 patients, while trying various previously used or proposed therapies for other CoV treatments such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as other viral diseases (Schedule2).
These therapies include current and potential treatment with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from patients who have recovered is recommended to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 usually attacks the lungs in the initial stages and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that produce ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and respiratory failure are major threats to patients and are the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is important to relieve symptoms and save lives as well as include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by the oxygenation of the extraorporeum membrane (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary graft technique used for the treatment of cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolyte balance retention, prevention and treatment of secondary infections as well as sepsis shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storms result from an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines trigger immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunoinsulin is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immuno-suppression treatments for cytokine storms include T-cell-directed immune response modulation; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF inhibition; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine signal suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibition.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in treating SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids at high doses can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, affecting the prognosis significantly.
However, low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for short periods have been recommended to be used with caution in critical COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this article, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous use with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective in an American patient infected with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also indicated the possibility of inhibition of other single threaded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these observations, Gilead has given the mixture to China to conduct a pair of trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse effects may occur after combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from patients who have recovered and antibody generation
Blood collection from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from infection has a long history.
It is true that patients who have recovered usually have relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in their blood.
An antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and it identifies a unique molecule in the pathogen and neutralizes it directly.
Based on this, plasma has been collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and have been injected into 10 patients who are in serious condition.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load as well as increased saturation in the blood.
However, verification and explanation are needed to suggest such a method for large-scale use before specific therapies are yet to be developed.
In addition, due to the presence of therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with the plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and the demand for plasma is great for treating critical patients.
It is difficult to quickly develop and produce specific antibodies to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from patients who have recovered and identify the genetic code that encodes effective antibodies or filters antibodies that are effective against important viral proteins.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends heavily on the combination of various components in formulas that vary according to the diagnosis of the disease based on the theory of TCM.
Most effective components remain unknown or blurred as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the primary alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients have been seen in some regions in China that use TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which uses TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest recovery rates (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of patients need to be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study to compare western medicine (WM) treatments alone with a combination of WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, symptoms loss and hospital treatment was significantly shorter in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the rates for symptomatic conditions became significantly lower (from mild to severe) for the WM<0x2B>TCM group from the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the death rate in the WM<0x2B>TCM group from the WM group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, TCM's efficacy and safety are still waiting for more controlled trials at greater levels and at more centers.
It must also be interesting to describe the mechanism of action and explain the components that are effective in the treatment of TCM or the combination of such treatments if possible.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 mostly experience a great fear of the disease that is highly contagious and can lead to death, while those who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia and cough as well as the adverse effects of treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to higher anxiety and mental distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, various psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide were also reported.
The detection of mandatory contact and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, can cause people to feel more worried and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and people in contact with them as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans as well as the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are important to disrupt the transfer chain of infected animals and humans to exposed hosts and usually complement antiviral treatments in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made by developing an S-protein-based vaccination to generate long-term and effective neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
A direct debilitating vaccine has been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo effectiveness of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and dangerous challenges models as well as their protection against zoonotic viral infections should be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to persistent zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some of them have been tested in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunized individuals is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome difficulties because a long period of time (an average of 18 months) is required for the development of vaccines and dynamic variation of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just shown a full clinical pathway in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without being re-infected.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is important for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas that lack resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 typically occurs between the ages of 30 and 65, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases mentioned above.
Patients who need intensive treatment are more likely to have hidden comorbidities and complications and are much older than those who don't need them (at the median age of 66 versus 51 years), suggest age as a prognosis factor for COVID-19 patients' results.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as noted above.
Commorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who need intensive treatment are more likely to develop acute cardiac injuries and arrhythmias.
Cardiac problems are also the cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be bound to ACE2-positive colangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is natural to note that age and concealed diseases are interrelated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been suggested as a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and final healing.
Linking CRP levels to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and increased creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict results.
This enzyme is secreted extensively in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and is excreted during tissue damage.
Therefore, it becomes a traditional marker for heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and the progression of clinical symptoms over time should be considered along with other issues to predict the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunotins are commonly used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
High doses of corticosteroids have been widely used in severe SARS patients, many former patients suffering from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients have suffered from extreme stress as they frequently face long quarantine periods and extreme uncertainty as well as the deaths of close family members and friends of patients.
It is important to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress as well as return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to doubles in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can double efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the initial phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or period of incubation can produce large amounts of the virus while performing daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is considered to occur during severe illness, while most transmissions do not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much worse and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are underway in China including curfews in Wuhan and surrounding cities as well as ongoing quarantines of nearly the entire population in hopes of severing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
While this action significantly damages the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients is declining, signaling a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic will end at the end of March and the decline phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., modelled for predicting the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both central turbine swabs and throats of patients who had recovered and left hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could be a recurring episode such as influenza.
However, a reassuring signal has taken place in China based on the growing number of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may be effective.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally under control.
So, just like SARS-CoV, it is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes weaker and eventually ends up or becomes a less pathogenic virus that co-exists with humans.
A comparison between the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is provided below (Diagram (Diagram 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is very contagious through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with contaminated substances.
The virus is also found in stools, which raises a new possibility of transmission from stool to mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were likely due to nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health workers.
Therefore, careful precautions should be used to protect people, especially health workers, social workers, family members, friends, and even people on the road in contact with patients or people infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of jaundice is by wearing a face mask; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series <0x23> 1860) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from individuals who are likely to be infected from spreading through ventilation or sticking to the surface of the material, which in turn can be spread to others.
However, only N95-type masks (<0x23>1860s series) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virions able to penetrate N95-type masks; SARS-CoV-2 is almost the same as SARS-CoV in terms of size where both are approximately 85 nm in size.
Since virus particles can penetrate five surgical face masks worn together, health workers who have direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series <0x23>1860s) instead of surgical face masks.
In addition to face masks, health care workers should wear personal protective equipment to reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect individuals through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 face mask; the virus may have entered his body through an inflammatory eye.
Healthcare workers should also wear transparent face protectors or safety glasses when dealing with patients.
For the public in the affected or potentially affected areas, it is advisable that all residents wash their hands with disinfectant soap regularly, stay at home and reduce contact with people who are likely to be infected.
A distance of three feet is considered an appropriate distance to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective in reducing the risk of infection as well as preventing the transmission of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, the high homology of SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 warns China of the SARS outbreak that struck in 2003.
However, it was only on January 19, 2020 that the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of Wuhan tried to alleviate the concern of its citizens by saying that the novel virus has low rates of infection and limited reproduction in humans as well as prevention and containment of the disease was not a problem.
The message has eased public concern, especially when the entire country is preparing for the Autumn Festival, and it is not welcome to curb the spread of the epidemic on a minimum scale in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can take action on this and make improvements in the future.
For example, agencies should (1) be more careful in making public announcements as each detail delivered affects people's attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information received from clinics rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officers; (3) be more resolute in curbing the epidemic than reassuring the public; and (4) exercise more frequently to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the response system.
COVID-19 is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus that began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and nearly 50 countries around the world when this writing was made.
Since the virus is almost the same as SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also very similar to SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sentiment that the SARS outbreak has been repeated.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in curing epidemics as well as treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than younger people and affects more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate is also higher in the elderly than in the young.
SARS has a higher mortality rate compared to COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can spread the virus without experiencing any symptoms while SARS patients spread the virus in a sick state, which results in difficulty in curbing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains the cause of SARS-CoV-2 spread more quickly and widely than SARS-CoV.
The results of the RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for COVID-19 patients.
However, patients who have recovered can be found positive for the virus.
These findings indirectly increase the risk of transmission of the virus.
Based on the rapid progress in the study of COVID-19, several critical issues still need to be addressed, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic homologous are found in SARS-CoV-2 and two CoVs such as bat SARS, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is also derived from bats.
What animal is the intermediate species that transmits the virus from a host, for example a bat, to a human?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and 2, we can't decide the transmission efficiently, and the outbreak can recur at any time.
Although molecular and biochemical model tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is bound to ACE2, how can the virus actually enter the cells of the airways and in turn cause pathological changes?
Does the virus bind to ACE2 expression cells to other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does this virus develop genetically through transmission among humans?
Will it be a worldwide pandemic, eradicated like SARS or repeated periodically like a flu?
This is important but it will take time to find answers to the above questions and various other questions.
However, regardless of the cost to be claimed, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normal.
The zoonotic origin of the human coronavirus
Mutations and adaptations have driven the evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its main hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) had been known to cause mild illnesses, such as flu.
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has changed views and revealed how terrible and life-threatening HCoVs are.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China at the end of 2019 has drawn attention to CoV and surprised us with its simple, but less pathogenic infectivity than SARS-CoV.
HCoV infections are zoonotic and an understanding of the zoonotic origin of HCoV can help us.
Most HCoVs come from non-pathogenic bats.
Intermediate reservoir hosts for some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
Investigations on the interaction of CoV hosts in animals allow for the importance of an understanding of the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this study, we presented an overview of the existing knowledge of the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as the origin of zoonotic and transmission between species.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate HCoV differences from the perspective of viral evolution and genome re-integration.
The epidemic of COVID-19 is discussed in this context.
In addition, the need for a successful host exchange as well as the implications for the evolution of the virus to the severity of the disease is also underscored.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of single-stranded, positive, sheathed RNA viruses.
The length of this genome is between 26 and 32 kilobase and is the largest genome among RNA viruses and is named "CoV" because of its morphological shape that looks like a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of structure, CoVs have a non-segmented genome that shares the same structure.
It is estimated that two-thirds of the genome has two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) stacked against each other, which are then translated into pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein replicase.
Polyproteins are then processed to produce 16 non-structured proteins, known as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The remainder of the genome consists of ORFs for structured proteins, including papaws (S), covers (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
A number of protein accessories are also encoded according to different customer CoVs.
Based on differences in protein sequence, CoV is classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the beta-CoV genera consist mostly of HCoV and are divided into four sequences (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and mice act as gene sources for most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are major reservoirs for gamma-CoV and delta-coV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have surpassed the resistance of the species and some have emerged as important pathogens of humankind.
So far, seven human coronaviruses (HCoV) have been identified.
Among these are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 which are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
Conversely, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, resulting in severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients with a high probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients suffering from the flu in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which lead to symptoms of self-control.
This concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infections were harmless until the SARS outbreak emerged.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 and is one of the most devastating in history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a gross mortality rate of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, an outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread around the world.
The novel HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), later named as SARS-CoV-2, is an agent causing the ongoing epidemic of the 2010 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-1), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 individuals as of March 3, 2020.
We have been warned and the world needs to be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins from bats, rats and domestic animals.
Various evidence supports the evolutionary origins of all HCovs from bats, where viruses are adaptable and not pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-2019 epidemic has brought great medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China as well as the rest of the world.
Detection of the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and restrictive factors for species jumping.
It may also guide and facilitate the search for reservoir animal hoses, intermediates and recyclers for SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the prevention of future overflows.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, transmission between species and pathogenesis of HCoV.
In particular, we outlined and discussed a common theme where HCoV virions are not pathogenic in a host's natural reservoir but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to new hosts.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoVs where increased transmission often comes with a reduction in pathogenicity.
The results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal discharge of cold-stricken patients, different CoVs were isolated in a variety of infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV findings in the chronological order (Table 1) can provide information and instruction.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of a patient with a germ infection in the upper respiratory tract in 1966, and subsequently adapted to grow within the line of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E are seen with flu symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, lethargy and sore throat, with fever and cough seen in 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequently serialized passages in the brains of breastfeeding mice.
The clinical picture of HCoV-OC43 infection is similar to that of HCoV-229E, which is symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and tend to spread more during winter in temperate regions.
Typically, the duration of incubation of both viruses is less than one week, followed by the disease for about 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E experienced a mild common cold.
Only a handful of immunocompromised patients show severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", is the first well-recorded HCoV pandemic in human history and its etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spread across many countries and continents.
In addition to the super spreaders, it is estimated that each case can cause about two secondary cases, with a duration of incubation ranging from 4 to 7 days and a viral-free peak appearing on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially exhibit myalgia, headaches, fever, fever and cold, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphophenia, a scattered liver function test and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Diffused alveolar damage, epithelial cell breeding and increased macrophage were also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to infections of the lower respiratory tract, various organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can lead to death especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from a relative's open lung biopsy to an index patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, many efforts have been put in place for HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
Initially, the virus was found to be widespread among children, elderly people and patients who are immune to respiratory diseases.
The presence of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the same viral isolation from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and the peak time of occurrence of the disease is during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis that are infected in the community, HCoV-HKU1 is also reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
All four infected HCoVs in this community have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents do occur for unknown reasons as there are rare cases of the more damaging subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused severe lower respiratory infections in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to spread efficiently and to remain continuously in the human body, the virus also becomes less harmful or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient suffering from acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary transmission to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations for MERS equal SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also have acute kidney failure, which is unique to MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with high case deaths of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the worst viruses to hit humans.
During mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients who were retrospectively known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the current outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as an International Public Health Emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been reported worldwide, with gross case deaths of 3.4%.
Significantly, the death toll in Hubei, China was 4.2%, while the death toll outside the area was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea also occurs in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the homology of high nucleotide sequences of 82%, the virus clusters into different branches on phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to rapid transmission worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation time and duration of the occurrence of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four HCoVs found from the community (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
In one sense, SARS-CoV-2 infections show more frequent features seen during infection by HCoVs found from the community, including the presence of nonspecific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly low.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also showed interesting pattern characteristics for both HCoVs found from the community and SARS-CoVs.
In some ways, SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the HCoV found in the community.
On the other hand, it is difficult to confirm whether the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing through humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
Whether stool transfer to the mouth for SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under certain conditions awaiting enlightenment through future studies.
It's also interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 may be triggered by season as in the case of infected HCoVs in the community.
However, features of SARS-CoV-2 including contagiousness, pathogenicity and continuous post-human transmission will affect the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four HCoVs infected in the community cause mild symptoms to have adapted well to humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the past HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who suffer from severe HCoV disease have been eliminated.
To enable this to happen, HCoVs need to double in humans to a sufficient degree to enable the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the host restriction factor.
Therefore, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak survives and the more infected humans, the greater the chance for the virus to fully adapt to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to prevent with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four infected CoVs in the community circulated in the human population, triggering a common cold in an uncompromised subject.
The virus does not require an animal reservoir.
Conversely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and transmission of the virus in humans cannot be maintained.
The virus must remain and reproduce in its zoonotic reservoirs and seek opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and reproductive hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same characteristics as both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and all four HCoVs infected in the community.
It is very contagious as infected HCoVs are in the community, at least at the moment.
However, the virus is more pathogenic than HCoV infected in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
The time will determine whether the virus will be fully adaptable to humans and spread among humans without reservoirs or intermediate animal hoses.
Before discussing the animal origins that cause HCoV, it is better to discuss the definition and characteristics of HCoV evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and reproductive hosts.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoVs if it has very close heirs that share high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
Hereditary viruses usually adapt well and are not pathogenic in these hoses.
Similarly, reservoir hoses store HCoV on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, the host is usually naturally infected and is a natural host for HCoV or its virion.
On the other hand, if new HCoVs are introduced to intermediate hosts before or around their introduction to humans, the virus does not adapt well to new hosts and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source for human infections and play a role as a reproductive host by allowing the virus to temporarily multiply and then transmit the virus to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
HCoV can suffer from a dead pathway infection if it is unable to maintain its infectivity in intermediate hoses.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate hosts and also create long-term edema.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveals restrospectively that cases of the SARS index have a history of contact with hunting animals.
Further investigations of seroprevalence showed that animal sellers had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general public.
Lamri mushrooms (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the live animal market were first identified to carry a SARS-CoV-like virus that is almost similar to SARS-CoV.
This is indirectly supported by the fact that no SARS was reported again after killing all the weasels in the market.
However, it has been reported that lamri weasels from forests or farms without exposure to live animal markets are mostly negative SARS-CoV, suggesting that lamri weasels may only be hoses of reinforcing intermediaries but not of SARS-CoV's natural reservoirs.
Most notably, since 80% of different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that various species of small mammals may also be intermediate-strengthening hosts for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of this seems to be a dead road host for SARS-CoV.
A further search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, called CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) rhinolophus bat associated with SARS, which exists in Chinese bats.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
These bats and other CoV bats share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
This study has provided the basis for a new concept that bat hosts produce human pathogens.
Some CoVs such as SARS (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none except one known as WIV1 can be isolated as living viruses.
The human angiotensin exchange enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from bat stool samples was shown using bats, weasels and human ACE2 as recipients for cell entry.
Interestingly, patients with SARS have been found to be able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related descent for SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus for SARS-CoV and that bats are not a direct reservoir host for SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis put MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV bats use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
RNA polymerase-dependent RNA from MERS-CoV is phylogenetically closer to viruses in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and the closest family of CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be a reservoir hose directly to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that arab camels have a positive effect on MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, much like camels in the Middle East that are native to various African countries.
A live MERS-CoV similar to a virus found in humans has been isolated through an Arab camel's nasal swab, further suggesting that the camel serves as a pure MERS-CoV reservoir hose.
It is also worth noting that generally moderate symptoms but large decay of the virus have been observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV.
In particular, infected camels release viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through the stool-mouth passage, which is also the pathway for the virus to be released from bats.
However, the question remains since many confirmed cases of MERS had no history of contact with camels before symptoms began, possibly linked to a human-to-human transmission pathway or an unknown pathway of spread involving an unknown animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of homologous nucleotides with RaTG13 CoV bats isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
In cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence deviation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to determine the parent relationship.
Arguably, bats may not be the closest reservoir host to SARS-CoV-2 unless a nearly similar bat CoV is discovered in the future.
Perhaps, the intermediate animal host to SARS-CoV-2 is from a wild species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which is linked to many early cases of COVID-19, suggesting a possible event of animal spread to humans.
Some recent studies based on the metagenomic sequence have suggested that a small group of endangered mammals known as pangolins (Javanica sweets) may also store hereditary beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This genome of pangolin CoV shares 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% of the identities at the nucleotide sequence level.
They were grouped in two subgenerations of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in pilogenetic trees, one of which shared a receptor binding domain (RDB) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% of amino acid sequence identities.
In real differences, RBD from SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more distorted, despite having higher degrees of genome-wide homology sequence.
Previous studies of infected pangolins also reported detection of contagious viruses from lung samples, which were later found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study uses a collection method and selects manual stacking to generate a partial sequence of the genome that comprises about 86.3% of the full viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support SARS-CoV-2 originating directly from pangolins due to a series of deviations between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associated with SARS-COV-2 pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV associated with SARS-COV-2 pangolins.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be established.
While the highest homology sequence has been found in the RBD between SARS-COV-2 and pangolins, beta-CoVs are related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG12 which share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
Strong speculation suggests that the high-level equations between RBD from beta-CoV related SARS-CoV-2 pangolins and SARS-CoV-2 are driven by the evolution of inter-choice concentrated.
A counter-recommendation favors a re-combination of beta-CoV related SARS-CoV-2 pangolins and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
As the driving force of evolution, re-engineering occurs widely in beta-CoV.
Research is still being done on the origin of the direct zoonotic SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from bat CoVs, while virions HCoV-OC43 and HCov-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American three-color bats showed a close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, dubbed Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which has been detected in Ghana, while camelid has also been suspected of being an intermediate host.
To be clearer, current knowledge of the animal origins of known HCoVs is formulated in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for HCoV transmission events between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E transmission between species is vague.
But alpha-CoV bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been discovered.
One of them is alpha-cov alpaca.
Some lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpacas may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Secondly, alpha-CoV bats associated with HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpha-CoV alpacas trigger respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-CoV alpacas are not found in wild animals.
Therefore, it is likely not to be excluded that alpacas get alpha-CoV-related HCoV-229E from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, even though alpha-CoV bats become the incubator of the HCoV-229E gene, alpacas and arabic camels may be the intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is the best example of transmission between species from bats to arab camels and from arab camels to humans.
The evolution of the original MERS-CoV from bats was known at the beginning of its introduction and has been reinforced with subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide the depths of viral species for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and transmission between species.
Long life, crowded colonies, close social interactions and strong flying ability are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal 'virus spreader'.
In addition, MERS-CoV has been introduced to Arabian camels for decades.
It adapts well to these camels that have switched from intermediate hoses to stable and natural reservoir hoses.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is accidental and humans remain the final host to MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be maintained.
In contrast to camel function in the spread of MERS-CoV, pangolin function, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolin.
They may be late hosts for SARS-CoV-related beta-CoV-2, similar to weasels in the case of SARS-CoV.
Some possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species from animal to human should be accepted or rejected in future studies.
First, bats can be a reservoir host for the SARS-CoV-2-related virus that is almost the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins can be one of the newly identified intermediate amplifier hoses of the SARS-CoV-2-related virus.
Humans are infected with the virus through slaughter and feeding on prey animals.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is required.
Thirdly, as noted above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that had contact with both bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Aside from the different types of host animals, the three main factors in the virus section are also important in making it easier for CoVs to cross species barriers.
First, they are relatively high mutation rates in RNA multiplication.
Compared to single thread RNA viruses, the estimated rate of CoV mutations can be thought of as "moderate" to "high" with an average exchange rate of <0x7E>10-4 exchanges per year per 2 sites, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to a novel host.
CoVs have proof-reading exoribonucleas, their deletion causing very high variability and weakening or possibly even the absence of vitality.
Interestingly, the Remdesivir nucleotide analogue is known to suppress CoV multiplication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the best anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than the host.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoV is not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, mutation rates in SARS-CoV-2 appear to be low, suggesting a high degree of adaptation to humans.
Perhaps, he has also adapted to other hoses close to humans.
Aside from SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to arabic camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic shifts will make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in a short period of time.
Second, the largest RNA genome in CoV uses additional plasticity in genome changes for mutation and re-combination, while increasing the probability of mutual evolution between species, which is beneficial for the novel emergence of CoV when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by a large number of unique open reading skeletons and protein functions encoded towards the 3' end of the genome.
Thirdly, CoV switches templates randomly and frequently during RNA multiplication through a unique "tire-selective" mechanism.
In hosts that serve as mixed containers, thread exchange often occurs during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Highly homologous subgenomic and full RNA can be recombined to produce new CoVs.
Natural fusion phylogenetic evidence has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as CoV animals such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus host interactions are related to transmission.
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of viruses with host receptors is another major factor that affects transmission between species.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a special example, which also shows evidence of positive choice during the event of inter-species transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between human isolation and weasel SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in RBD on the S protein.
Generally, RBD on the S protein on the CoV interacts with cells and is strongly selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the amino acid 318 to 510 in the fragment S1, which binds to human ACE2 as well as the joint receptors for virus entry.
RBD from SARS-CoV is able to identify ACE2 receptors from a variety of animals, including bats, weasels, rats and raccoon dogs, allowing the spread of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 remaining amino acids are observed as distinct from the isolation of human and weasel viruses in RBD and 4 of them are located within the receptor binding motif for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The weasel SARS-CoV has mutations of K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the linkage of the random protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, both amino acid exchanges may be important for the adaptation of viruses to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same receptor cells as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that the S protein's linkage to human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, cryo-EM research has shown that the correlation between this bond is 10 to 20 times higher than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors may be needed for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
More interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors that exist, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and sialic acid 9-O for HCoV-OC43.
It may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after transmission between species from its animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the consequences of transmission between HCoV species also depend on the dependence of hosts and other barrier factors.
This difference in host protein between humans and natural HCoV reservoir hoses such as bats, arab camels and rodens may create barriers to transmission between species.
HCoVs need to seize the host dependency factor and subvert the host restriction factor for successful transmission between species.
In this case, molecular determinants in important areas of the interaction of these virus-hoses are still not identified and characterized.
Screening around the genome that is unbiased for hose reliance and blocking factors for SARS-CoV-2 using sophisticated CRISPR technology may be fruitful.
The rise of the HCoV novel: Back to the beginning
The diversity of bat CoVs provides a wide range of opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as a pool of HCoV genes.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and act as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a novel protein encoding gene has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adapting to humans, as the SARS-CoV-related bat virus has been isolated but found to encode the scavenging ORF8 protein.
Characteristics of nucleotide-29 SARS-CoV extinguishing have been found in strains isolated at the onset of human epidemics.
This rupture separates ORF8a into ORF8b and is considered to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host exchange.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gamma CoV descendants, whose large number of smaller recombination areas have been identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
The location of the re-combination is also identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV epidemic has been shown to experience a re-combination between different breeds, which occurs in arab camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination occurrences were also observed in other HCoVs, which saw HCoVs rejoin other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
A warning should also be given that false selection can contribute to unintentional changes in the viral genome, which are most likely to result from freeing the virus from the pressure of imposed selection, such as by the host's immune system.
One example of this effect is the loss of full length ORF4 in the prototype thread HCoV-229E, as a result of the deletion of two nucleotides.
While strong ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpacas display single nucleotide insertion, which results in skeletal displacement.
Finally, the evolution of HCoV novels is also spurred by selection pressure in their reservoir hoses.
Only mild asymptomatics or symptoms have been detected when a bat is infected with CoV, signaling a joint adjustment between the CoV and the bat.
It seems that bats adapt well to CoVs anatomically and psychologically.
For example, damage in the activation of pro-inflammatory responses in bats efficiently reduces pathologies triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is curtailed due to increased regulation of NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell receptors and low expression levels for major class 1 histocompatibility complex molecules.
Furthermore, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can both withstand CoV doubling and affect proof readings by exoribonucleases, thus providing selective pressure for the care of viral strains is highly pathogenic when introduced to new hosts.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve through recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for hoses adaptation.
So it's no coincidence that three novel HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hoses such as bats and camels.
It doubles rapidly without triggering a strong host immune response.
This is where the secret of the asymptomatic carrier is seen and the cause for severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mostly due to the activation of the hyper immune response and cytokine storms where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been deactivated from CoV multiplication.
The same strategies that deactivate the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is very strong in bats.
Therefore, the administration of interferon type 1 at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, inflammasome activation in bats is ineffective.
For this reason, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common theme of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although bat beta-CoVs that share 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been discovered, there are also bat CoVs that share 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although weasels and other animals on the market have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
A highly homologous pangolin beta-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or a pangolin beta-CoV may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was produced by humans intentionally or accidentally.
CoV has returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our view of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs for HCoVs in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and were transferred to humans via intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infections stem from human-to-female contact in the market, closing the wet market and killing the feline should be able to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolins should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, caused by the discovery of multiple descendants of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the weather and the way SARS-CoV-2 is transferred to humans through pangolins and other mammals will need to be explained in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in arab camels for a long time.
The camel has become an important tool for transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and fur products for the local community.
It is found throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as it is claimed in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent the spread of the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, which is combined with other infection control measures.
Since we can't get rid of this virus, a new genotype may appear to cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs are spread in the forest.
In particular, CoV bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are many opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new CoVs that are more contagious and/or can kill in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be stopped to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experiences of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response plans should be made.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet a long time ago.
The virus remains in natural reservoirs until there is a chance of transmission.
Although bats have many characteristics that facilitate the spread of the virus, the chances of humans having contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if communities are educated to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal transmission to humans as well as future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep humans away from natural ecological reservoirs for zoonotic viruses.
Some questions about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remain unanswered.
First, if a bat transmits the SARS-CoV-2 inherited virus to a pangolin, it must be interesting to see how bats and pangolins can share the same ecological nic.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to humans, we must determine how humans get in contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate host, the way it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins need to be explained.
Finally, since many mammals including exotic animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental monitoring and infection should be carried out.
Whether bats, pangolins or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or a similar parent virus will be identified in its natural host in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this area will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the diagnostic criteria of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" for COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team published quick advice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV), and these guidelines provide our experiences as a good reference for fighting this pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is slowly increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
In this letter, we have answered a review of our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "certified cases" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version) released by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-10 a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infections, our team has developed fast-paced advice guidelines and those guidelines have been published in Military Health Research February 06, 2020.
The guide has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is slowly increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, have released a total of seven editions with some fundamentally altered contexts.
Now that our guidelines received reviews by Zhou et al., they introduced easy scoring recommendations based on their clinical experience.
Their efforts add new evidence to our guidelines and are also a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We recognize their important efforts and thank them.
However, their efforts also require updates in accordance with the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh Edition trial) and the latest study.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case requires the combination of any one item from an epidemiological historical feature with two items of clinical manifestation to produce a thorough analysis, or the need to meet three items of clinical manifestation if without a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or living in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding area, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 14 days before symptoms began; (2) a history of contact with SAR-CoV-2 infection (with positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in such areas as the school of Wuhan and the surrounding area, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported within 2 days before symptoms began; (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms, such cases, such cases, such cases, such cases, such cases, such as a small school, and respiratory symptoms, etc.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) white blood cell count indicating normal, declining, or reduced lymphocyte count in the early stages.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on a suspected case with any one pathogenic item or serological evidence as follows: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a genome sequence of the whole virus shows high homogeneity to the known novel coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM antibodies or positive antibodies for IgM antibodies or SatG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests
We can see that real-time PCR tests for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples have been added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples has been included in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); and then serological evidence is included in the seventh edition.
This modification is based on the continuous work of researchers looking for the optimal nucleic acid detection kit for immediate detection, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which increase the availability of different specimens, and support bringing positive results of specific antibodies into verified criteria.
In addition, there is an increasing amount of evidence reminding us to be vigilant with typical or asymptomatic symptomatic patients.
Therefore, flow charts from Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify the invidivu without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system should also be verified in practice and further clinical studies.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come and call on readers to comment.
For diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend tracking and complying with the new guidelines of their country of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest death rate in a day caused by a virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Epidemiology (IEDCR) reported the total number of infections recorded including 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases sitting at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases are over 60, two of which are 51 and 60, and 41-50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID 19 a pandemic on March 11.

On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Road and Bridge Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be shut down longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The closure of public transport was originally started on March 26 and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods -- medicines, oil and food -- is still allowed.
The first recorded COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people returning from Italy and the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, all three have recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections worldwide.
As of Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, an outbreak caused by the coronavirus.
The benchmark was present on the same day Malawi confirmed the first infection of the coronavirus and Zambia had the first death associated with the coronavirus.
North Korea claims that as of Thursday, it is among the few countries that are free from coronavirus infections.

Shops in Australia have lowered the limit of toilet paper once a transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toilet paper to two and one-off packages of transactions each in all stores at the national level.
ALDI also introduced a pack limit, on Monday.
This limit is broadcast as an order on the check-out, and on the chain's Facebook page.
Buyers are reportedly buying stock due to COVID-19 fears if individuals need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery purchases to one pack per order.
These changes followed a four-pack restriction for each transaction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
Coles, in a media release on March 8, reported that with the implementation of the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still out of stock within an hour of delivery", and called the request "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales rose in a "sudden rise" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to two packs last week.
To further ease the shortfall, Coles ordered a larger package than suppliers and increased frequencies of shipments, Woolworths booked additional stock, while ALDI made stock for special Wednesday plans available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers were trying to add stock but local council restrictions on delivery by trucks made it difficult.
He expects an increase in the cost of the product, as the supplier tries to meet the demand, and a bit of a special one.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the initial production of stocks, some stores could not carry out specials on Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the stores fill in stocks every night.
He said toilet tissue is a large item, leading to a low quantity on the stock volume, and, when sold out, leaving a large shelf space empty, further strengthening the feeling of lack.
Coles and Woolworths have a view [that] if there's a variety of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and decoction materials can [buy] and have quantities, you're likely to reduce the panic Russell Zimmerman said on ABC News.
Recycling toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap last Wednesday was out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who makes Kleenex Toilet Towels, and Solaris Paper who makes Sorbent, insist that they work 24/7 to maintain supplies, according to a New.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate sellers offered toilet paper for free to first bidders at auction sessions in Melbourne, when few auctions were held as buyers faced time off during the Labor Day holiday.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily print in Darwin, included eight additional pages intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores initially refused to impose sanctions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 that saw them say they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry food, hand washing and flooring tools.
Also outside Australia, on Sunday evening the online supermarket Ocado was seen limiting the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packs.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO)'s ongoing COVID-19 outbreak - a disease stemming from the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus - became a pandemic.
While the word "pandemic" only refers to the extent to which the disease has spread, it is not how dangerous certain cases are, WHO is aware of the need to urge governments to act:
All countries can change the course of the pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, track and move their people to action, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
We are very concerned about both the level of transmission and the severity of the worry as well as the level of inaction that is worrying.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was "unprecedented."
He said, in a quote published by CNN in February, "aside from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected from the emergence to the ongoing worldwide transmission."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we've never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He continued, "and we've never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "shortly, things will get worse."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported there have been at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, causing more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, announced as a General Health Emergency at the International Level on January 30, 2020, and declared as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, causing about 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people have recovered.
The death toll has been estimated at 4% in China, while worldwide between 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may be between two and fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccination or antiviral treatment known.
The main treatments are symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth while coughing, maintaining distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for those who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfew orders, workplace hazard control and closure of facilities.
The pandemic has caused global socioeconomic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread supply shortages driven by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been closed either nationwide or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, as well as those from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of travel reductions and heavy industry closures, there has been a decrease in air pollution as well as carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported clusters of cases of pneumonia from unknown causes on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and caused the virus to be suspected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak was known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV.The earliest person known to experience the symptoms was later found to have fallen ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no apparent contact with the later wet market cluster.
For the initial cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case traced back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province, may be the first case.On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases reported in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Koea, the number of new cases outside China has surpassed the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a corresponding number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases have been reported among adolescents, with those aged 19 and below equalling 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the British population must be infected before effective group immunity can be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose tests have been tested positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test those with mild symptoms only, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections have not been detected, and that these unrecorded infections are the source for 79% of recorded cases.
Statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the increase number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 have recovered.
For those who do not, the period of development of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths are among those over 60 years of age, and 75% have existing health problems including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official death count from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to people who have tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who die without being tested - e.g. at home, at a nursing home, etc.
Separate data from Italy found that the number of surplus deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stated "We know that [the stated number of deaths] is underestimated", a statement backed by anecdotal reports of undercounts in the U.S. Less estimates were so frequent in pandemics, such as during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic H1N1. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of mainland China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country have been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures have been used prevalently to express the quantity of deaths.
This figure varies by area and time, as well as is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the early outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of mortality to cases describes the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality-to-case ratio was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The numbers vary by area.
In China, estimates for the mortality ratio with cases decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020).Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which describes the percentage of those diagnosed who die from the disease, and the rate of infection death (IFR), which describes the percentage of those infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed from the disease) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not tied to time and follow specific populations from infections through case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate this number for a specific population.
The Oxford University Evidence-Based Medicine Center estimates that the overall infection mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top estimates for this range are consistent with results from the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on CFR estimates.
WHO says the pandemic is under control.
The peak and peak duration of the outbreak is uncertain and can vary according to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Left unchecked, the infectious outbreak is usually horizontal and then begins to deteriorate as the disease runs out of available housing.
But it is almost impossible to make any reasonable projections now as to the timing of that situation."
Senior Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "the pandemic could end by June" if all countries could be moved to comply with WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Tropical Hygiene <0x26> Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue circulating, perhaps for a year or two".
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical separation and other measures will be required "until the vaccine is available (maybe 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I don't think it's possible that this coronavirus - because it's so contagious - will disappear completely" and it "may become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The harm of such re-emergence will depend on the immunity of the group and the stage of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively unspecific and an infected person may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory sputum, loss of odor, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, hemoptisis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become very sick and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists the symptoms of emergencies as difficulty breathing, pain or constant pressure on the chest, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and eyes or lips become bluish; immediate medical treatment is advised if these symptoms are present. Further improvements of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, septic shock
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results confirming the infection, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact with infected people should be closely monitored and checked to ensure there is no infection.
China estimates an asymptomatic ratio ranging from slightly to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms begins) ranges from one to 14 days; most commonly five days.For example, the estimated fraction of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell at first 30% and then decrease to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spread are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; with close contact being at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that an unprotected cough will cause the droplets to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted through small droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may be generated while speaking. Respiratory droplets may also result when releasing breath, including while speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
The droplets may land in the mouth or nose of a nearby person or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretion to become sprayed and therefore result in airborne spread.
The virus can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then they touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that the virus can spread through stool, the risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of stool-to-mouth transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but infection may occur before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggest that transmission can occur before the presence of significant symptoms.
Few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by several countries during contact detection investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that while it is not very clear how easily the disease spreads, one usually infects two to three others. The virus remains on the surface for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, for a day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities advise to wash hands after touching animals, such as after touching other surfaces that may have been touched by those infected.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with clusters of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All novel features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in relation to coronaviruses in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which destroys its protective sheath.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that coronaviruses are genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (generation B) along with two threads derived from bats.
The virus is 96% similar at full genome levels to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in a specific part of the genome sequence between viruses from pangolins to viruses from humans.
The differences across the genome so far have found that at most 92% of the genetic material is shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove pangolin as an intermediate host.
The infection by the virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, although the contraceptive eventually through transcription reverses the polymerase chain response (rRT-PCR) for infected secretion or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with most of its imaging features overlapping with the process of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for screening or as the first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19".
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-1, with the first being issued on January 17.
The test used real-time reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be performed on a sample of respiratory or blood.
Test results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
Typically this test is carried out with a nasopharyngeal swab but a throat swab can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests have proven to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the U.S. a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging features of radiographs and computerized tomography (CT) for symptomatic opaques include asymmetric peripheral glass opacity and absent pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiology Association is gathering an online database to look for imaging for confirmed cases.
As a result of stagnation with other infections such as adenovirus, the imaging of verification by PCR has a limited specialization in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although imaging is less specific to infections, the method is faster and more sensitive, suggesting consideration of the method as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
A circular neural network based on artificial intelligence has been developed to detect cili imaging of viruses with both radiographs and CTs.
Strategies to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing on tissues and putting the tissue directly into the trash container.
Those who may have been infected have been advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also proposed to prevent transmission. Many governments have blocked or advised to avoid all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached the level of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some community members do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers who take care of a person who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact detection is an important method of determining the source of infection and to prevent further transmission.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement asking for limits on this surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to login close to a user with another cell phone.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash is ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop the vaccine.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the virus.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly using soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands look dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by home soap, which destroys its protective bubbles.
The CDC further recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol according to the content when soap and water are not available for use.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be contaminated with a number of solutions (within a minute of exposure to the decomposition for stainless steel surfaces), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidon-iodin.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate kroexidine, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if COVID cases are suspected or confirmed in facilities such as offices or day care centers, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by the sick person should be decommissioned.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with bent arms or tissues during coughing or sneezing, and remove any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing masks can limit the amount and distance of travel of expiry droplets spread during talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is the main source of infection without proper hand hygiene care."
The WHO has recommended wearing masks by those who are healthy only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of people with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by community members.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made from fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the community, especially when in close contact (1 metre (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks while using public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to wear fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibit public exits without wearing a mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government stipulated that everyone entering the grocery store should wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public places.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks daily since mid-March, asked intercity train and bus passengers to wear face masks on April 1.
Panama has been obliged to wear face masks when going out, while recommending home makeup for those who can't afford face masks.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social confinement (also known as physical isolation) is accompanied by infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and physically isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are now obliging or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum assembly size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if no known COVID-19 transmission in the region) to 50, and then to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings by more than two people. Older adults and those with hidden health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune system face an increased risk for serious illnesses and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible while clarifying the distance as possible to the area with a physical outbreak of community. By the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the term imprisonment
The use of the term “social imprisonment” has led to the implication that people should undergo full social isolation, rather than encouraging them to be in contact with others through alternative means. Some parties have issued sexual health guidelines for use during pandemics.
This includes a suggestion to have sex only with someone who lives with you, who has no virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been suggested to those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine to the entire population living in the affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those belonging to high-risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have previously traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to undergo self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of possible last exposure.
Strategy in controlling the epidemic is curbing or suppressing, and reducing.
The prevention is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate those infected as well as introduce infection control and other vaccination measures to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to curb the spread of the disease, efforts are then shifted to the diagnostic stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the health care system as well as the community.
A combination of preventing and reducing measures may be carried out at the same time.
Pressure requires a more decisive step to curb the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of managing the transmission of infectious diseases is trying to lower the epidemic peak, known as epidemic curve leveling.
This reduces the risk of health services being overloaded and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the transmission include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures targeted at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; so environmental measures such as surface cleaning have been targeted to curb the spread of the Chinese.
Other countries have also taken various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced large-scale screening and local quarantine, as well as issued warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provides financial support to those infected who quarantine themselves and imposes high fines on those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and fined the highlighting of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States showed that reductions (slowing down but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and emphasis (retarding epidemic growth) had major challenges.
Optimum reduction policies may reduce health care claims that culminate in 2/3 and deaths by half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and the health system to be overburdened.
Straining can be an option but should be maintained as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if that comes first), as the spread will immediately bounce back when preventive measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to mitigate the pandemic has resulted in social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Eating cold medications given over the counter, drinking water and resting will help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
Steroid use may exacerbate the consequences.
Some of the compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also stated that some "traditional and at home treatments" can provide relief to symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by WHO as a basic epidemic response measure.
The ECDC and WHO regional European offices have issued guidelines for key hospitals and healthcare services to mobilize resources at various levels, including focusing lab services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures when necessary, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and improving intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about where the first case (called an empty number patient) originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei was slowly increasing.
The case is mostly associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, has zoonotic origins. Clusters of unknown causes of pneumonia were observed on December 26 and treated by Zhang Jixian doctors at Hubei Province Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues about "a coronavirus like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, had been warned by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, had been scolded by his superiors for stirring up the matter.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public notice on December 31 and notified the WHO.
Sufficiently unknown cases of pneumonia have been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubles approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese territories, aided by China's New Year migration and Wuhan became a major transportation hub as well as a major railway exchange.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of March 26, 2020, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.

During this notification, doctors in Wuhan had been warned by police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" about human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party chief secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to prevent the spread of the virus.
Under what has been dubbed the "largest quarantine in human history", a quarantine siege was announced on Jan. 23 that halted travel in and out of Wuhan, which has extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of at least 57 million people.
Private vehicle use has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) are cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.

After the transmission entered the global phase in March, the Chinese government took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has enforced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On March 23, mainland China was only one case of domestic spread within 5 days, in this example the traveller returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that cases of domestic spread had been essentially blocked and that the transmission had been controlled by China.

The airline schedule was also affected and thus the schedule was changed. South Korea introduced a program that is considered to be the world’s most dispersed and organized program to screen populations for detecting the virus, and isolate any infected individuals and track and quarantine people associated with them.
The screening methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via a mobile app, a pilot virus test with results available the next day, and an enhanced test capability that allows up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean program was considered successful in controlling the epidemic despite not quarantining the entire city. The South Korean community was initially divided against President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.

Several Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian rejected preliminary notifications that the coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan, agreeing with conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the U.S. or Italy.
The U.S. administration under Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" saying that "China's censorship has produced a virus that has now turned into a global pandemic", which has subsequently been criticized by some critics as being racist and "trying to shift focus from its administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast acquired a U.S. government channel outlining communications tricks with a clear origin in the National Security Chamber, with the strategy being referred to as "everything is about China.
We are informed to try and keep this message disclosed in any way, including media conferences and appearances on television.

On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military medical teams, special decommissioning vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted "high-level political sources" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or little useful to Italy".
The source accused Russia of misappropriating its "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media report and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent cargo planes with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "while offering aid to friends in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that when U.S. medical equipment and materials manufacturers gain momentum, they will also be able to retaliate if necessary."
NATO's "Defender 2020" military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Balkans, NATO's largest combat exercises since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country is struggling to fight the epidemic as a result of lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States' sanctions on Iran. The outbreak has prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts expect the situation to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened as a result of the pandemic.
South Korea criticized "an obscure and passive quarantine effort" after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at a government-determined site.
South Koreans were initially unclear with President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for Moon's dismissal of things deemed to be the government's mismanagement of the epidemic, or praised his response. The pandemic has allowed the country to pass emergency laws in return.
Some commentators have voiced concerns that the move will allow the government to strengthen its grip on power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow prime minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree permanently, suspending parliament and elections and punishing those considered to have spread misinformation about the virus and handling the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus epidemic has been blamed for several incidents of supply shortages, stemming from the use of equipment to fight the rising epidemic worldwide, panic purchases, and disruption to factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about drug and medical equipment shortages due to increased consumer demand as well as supplier disruptions.
Some areas also saw panic purchases that caused slippery shelves from essential items such as food, toilet tissue, and bottled water, causing shortages of supply.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100 times.
This demand has led to a price increase of up to twenty times the usual price and also caused a delay in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, with the WHO warning that this would endanger the health of workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provides new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China.
The activity has caused a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and has been banned by the Australian government before. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and Wuhan provinces, as well as the ongoing high demand for food products, both areas have survived severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy to counter the accumulation of goods and the illegal sale of important products have been successful, avoiding the severe food shortages that have been expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with significant agricultural production has not seen a significant reduction, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food racks are only temporary, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials release pork reserves to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to store reserves for such emergencies.
Damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China has been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to control the spread of the virus, and retail sales plummeted by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and production hub, the virus epidemic has been seen to pose a major threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economic Intelligence Unit has predicted that the market will remain downhill until a clearer image emerges of potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic collapse caused by the epidemic on world growth could have surpassed the SARS epidemic in 2002-2004.
An estimate from experts at Washington University in St. Louis put a <0x24>300<0x2B> billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reportedly been "in turmoil" after falling oil prices due to lower demand from China.
The global stock market fell on February 24 as a result of a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about coronavirus transmission, several U.S. stock indices including the NASDAQ-100, the S<0x26>P 500 Index, the Dow Jones Industry Average reported its worst fall since 2008, with the 1,191-point Dow falling, the biggest fall in a day since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
All three indexes ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, the GmbH Scope Assessment confirmed China's credit score rate capability, but maintained the Negative Survey.
Shares collapsed due to fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall on March 16.
Many believe that there will be an economic downturn.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of central and state banks.
Central banks reacted faster than they did during the 2008 financial turbulence.
Tourism is the sector most affected by travel bans, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and the government's recommendation not to travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while regional airlines at British Flybe have been buried.
The impact on the cruise ship industry is at a level never seen before.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic happened by chance when Chunyun, a massive travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several public-run events have been cancelled by state and provincial governments, including the annual New Year's festival, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass rallies, including Beijing's Prohibition City and traditional temple parties.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and provinces, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to February 10, ordering all workplaces not to reopen until the date.
The region represents 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of infection response to the highest level and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year’s celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with a reduction in business hours or temporary closure.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a fall of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in walking traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping malls around the world are implementing additional measures, for example improving hygiene, installing heat scanners to check visitor temperatures, and cancelling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a pandemic-driven recession could cause an additional between 14 and 22 million people to experience extreme poverty in Latin America compared to those in the situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the nearly 300 million migrant workers from rural China have been stranded at home in rural areas or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
Coronavirus transmission could wipe out 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to an estimated by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. Emergency in India has left tens of millions of foreign workers in India (who are paid through daily pay) unemployed. A survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households are experiencing some sort of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since it underwent in the emergency in mid-March 2020.
By mid-March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary non-working benefits and 1 million British employees applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany had sent their employees to a government-subsidized short-term employee scheme known as Kurzarbeit.
The short-term work compensation scheme was implemented by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sector has been deeply impacted by the pandemic, affecting the organization's operations as well as individuals - both pay-eaters and free-workers - around the world.
Organizations of the arts and culture sectors try to enhance their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to communities, maintain the safety of their workers and communities, and support artists as much as possible.
As of March 202, all over the world and at varying levels, museums, libraries, show venues, and other cultural institutions have closed exhibitions, organising events and performances have been cancelled and postponed until uncertain time.
In the feedback, there are intensive measures to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and increasingly plummeting fall as a result of the pandemic is the cancellation of religious services, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology seminars, and fashion shows.
The film industry was also affected. The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian Lent season of repentance, had been cancelled.
Many bishops have suggested elderly Christians to sit at home rather than attend church ceremonies on Sundays; some churches have held church services via radio, live streams online or television while others have offered past-guided worship.
With the Roman Catholic Bishops of Rome closing churches and small churches as well as St. Peter's Square vacated from Christian congregations, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and shrines.
Iran's health minister announced Friday prayers were cancelled in areas affected by the epidemic and tombs were later closed, while Saudi Arabia blocked the entry of foreign pilgrims and residents to shrines in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused significant disruption to the sporting calendar around the world since World War II.
Most major sporting events have either been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, Euro UEFA 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak affected plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "re-scheduled to a date after 2020 but not beyond summer 2021". Casinos and gambling locations around the world have been closed as well as live poker matches have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has caused many gambling feet to switch to online, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in their new registration rates. The entertainment world has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling tour concerts.
Many large theaters such as Broadway also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute and introduce their work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to jokes and entertainment in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, increasing prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and roughness have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still limited in China) have captured racist sentiment portrayed in various groups around the world saying the Chinese deserved the virus or received what is claimed to be a fair retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Most residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their region of origin.
There is support for China, both on and offline, as well as against those in severe areas hit by the virus.
Following the development of the outbreak into the new hot country, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, could also become victims of suspicion and xenophobaia. People in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed a lobbying petition to ban Chinese people from entering the meeka country in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan fence has spread on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported an increasing degree of racist harassment, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that critics consider to be racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked a bus carrying Ukrainians and foreign migrants from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, who share borders with China, and study in India's main city have reported experiencing disruptions related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The Bharatiya Janata Party's state unit president in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese people have destroyed the environment and "that's why God rewards them for their actions."
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, calling it "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents have been tampered with by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "disposal".
Many newspapers with paid ads have released them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to the plague available with open access.
Some scientists choose to share their results instantly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for 2019 respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods for detecting the presence of the virus as well as methods for detecting antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and is designed only to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
The test is used to confirm a very new or active infection.
Antibody detection (cerology) can be used for both diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests show the number of patients who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report or who are asymptomatic.
The exact death rate due to the disease and the degree of group immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
As of March 2020, no country has expected data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is considerable diversity in the number of tests that have been performed across countries.
This diversity is also likely to significantly affect the reported death rate of cases, which may be overestimated significantly in some countries.
Using transcription of reverse chain reaction polymerase (rRT-PCR) real-time tests can be performed on respiratory samples obtained through a variety of methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with a swab of the throat is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Then the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to double in the lungs.
For those infected tested in the second mingu, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from inside the airway using inhalation catheter or the material causing cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription of polyemerase (rRT-PCR) reactions, and became the basis for 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom has also developed tests by January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kid, a kilnical grade (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Product Administration for SARS-CoV-2 detection kits based on PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Revel-Counselling Diagnos 2019
One in three genetic tests in the old version of the test kit resulted in uncertain results as a result of damaged reagents, and bottle neck tests at the CDC in Atlanta; this averaged less than 100 samples per day this successfully processed throughout February 2020;
Tests using two components were not confirmed to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and before then state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020 LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also makes the COVID-19 test available nationwide as of March 9, 2020.
No quantity limit has been announced; specimen collection and processing must be carried out according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test has been developed and produced by VECTOR National Centre for Virology and Biotechnology Research.
On February 11, 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic reportedly developed tests to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that could be done in 3.5 hours in high numbers, thus allowing one machine to perform about 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests that use isothermal nucleic acid enlargement technology instead of PCR.
Given that this test does not require a series of temperature-changing cycles this method can give positive results in as fast as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to accelerate production to deliver 50,000 tests a day. Tests that use monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to the new coronavirus nucleocapsid (N protein) proteon are being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that the test can deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes as fast as a flu test.
In March 2020 a review of the paper concluded that "the chest radiography has a small diagnostic value in the early stages, while the findings of CT [computerized tomography] may have been present even before symptoms begin."
Typical features of CT include the opacity of multilobar dual ground glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior scattering.
The dominance of the subpleura, the opening of the madness and the merger is formed as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specifically, with many of its imaging features acting with the process of pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test for diagnosing COVID-19". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infection in an individual starting 7 days or so after symptoms begin, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring. Assessments can be done in a central laboratory (CLT) or through a point-of-care (PoCT) test.
High-grade automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to carry out these assessments but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
For CLT a single peripheral blood specimen is commonly used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT a single specimen of blood is usually obtained through a puncture on the skin.
Unlike the PCR method of structuring measures are not required prior to evaluation. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provide the agency with the alert as needed and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples within a few hours and therefore much faster than conventional PCR ratings for viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection begins. In early April, the UK found no antibody test kits purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has prepared a scheme that sees patients suspected of staying at home, “an emergency office will give specimen tubes to patients”, they spit into the tube, send back and get test results soon. The British NHS has announced that it is pioneering a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of patients infecting others if they go to the hospital or need to sue a
The past centre has helped South Korea perform among the fastest, most comprehensive tests compared to other countries. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Medical Specialists said on March 2, that they had a capacity of 12,000 tests a day in ambulatory settings and 10,700 were tested in the previous week.
The expenses are covered by health insurance when the test is requested by a medical professional.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Jerman has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, pilot tests have been offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests performed in Germany is unknown, as only positive results are reported.
The first laboratory survey revealed up to the calendar week of 12/2020 as much as at least 483,295 samples were tested including 12/2020 weeks and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Language Hospitals developed and tested methods for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by collecting samples and only further testing if the combined samples were positive in Wuhan.
With the construction being monitored by BGI founder Wan Jian and taking 5 days, the model has shown the cases in Hubei will be 47% higher and the corresponding cost of handling the quarantine will double if the test capacity does not reach the target.
Wuhan's laboratories have been quickly followed by Hou Yan's laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020 the total daily amount is 50,000 tests per day. The open source, multiplexed design released by Origami Assays has been released that can test a total of 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 assessments. This balanced design can be carried out in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid operators.
As of March, the lack and insufficient amount of reagents have made it crowded for mass testing in the EU and in the UK and in the US.
This has prompted some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to remove the RNA genome for further testing.On March 31 it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was testing more of its citizens for the Coronavirus per head than any other country, and was on the right path to scale the level of the test to reach the majority of the population.
This is through a combination of past driving capabilities, and the purchase of large-scale population-capacity processing laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Hou-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China)
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world on this scale to be operated outside of China.
Different tests targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German method for the production of kits sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own kits.
The German method was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control did not exist until January 28, delaying existing tests in the U.S. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of its eruption, and the country and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing by health experts.
On the other hand, experts say South Korea's broad willingness to make tests helps reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The test capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for improving the testing program as the best way to slow the pace of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and the supply of chemical sweeps and regens to be limited.
In March 2020 China reported problems with accuracy on their test kits.
In the United States, the test kit developed by the CDC has a "weakness;" the government subsequently issued bureaucratic sanctions that had prevented private testing. The Spanish state purchased the test kit from Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the result inaccurate.
The firm explained that inaccurate results may be the result of failure to collect samples or use the kit correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would retract the kit that returned the wrong result, and would replace it with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits the Chech Republic bought from China gave the wrong result. The country of Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that this kit be thrown into the Danube.Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health told the test kit that Turkey bought from China had "a high fault rate" and did not "use it". The UK country bought 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced this test kit should not be used.
The test, followed by quarantining those tested positive and tracking those in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, Italy's first COVID-19 death site, conducted two rounds of tests on an entire population of nearly 3,400 people, about a ten-day interval.
Nearly half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases found were quarantined.
With travel restrictions, it has eliminated new infections altogether.
With aggressive contact detection, entry travel restrictions, tests, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has moved slower than in other developing countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and grocery stores.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has begun advising its citizens to sit at home on March 28, but schools will reopen in time after the holidays on March 23.
Several other countries have also controlled the pandemic by aggressively detecting contacts, entry travel restrictions, exams and quarantine, but with less aggressive emergency orders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with more tests, relative to the number of deaths, had lower mortality rates, perhaps because these countries were able to detect those with only mild or indirect symptoms better.
WHO recommends that countries with no national testing capacity and laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for verification tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are found in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "Positive as % test" column is influenced by the country's test policy.
Countries that only test individuals admitted to hospitals will have higher positive scores as a test percentage compared to countries that test all people, whether they show symptoms or not, the rest is the same.
Handwashing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands that aims to remove soil, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the transmission of many diseases, such as diarrhea and years, which are spread through the passage of stool to the mouth.
Individuals can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
The five critical times during the day that saw hand washing with soap are important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the child's back or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or birds.
If there is no water and soap, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning children who have used the toilet.
After blowing the nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal feed, or animal feces.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before handling medication or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in medicine, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and lower the rate of infant death at home birth.
A 2013 study showed improved hand washing practices would lead to a small increase in the height growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, the death rate in childhood associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, for example washing hands with soap.
This simple step can reduce the death rate from the disease to almost 50%.
Interventions advocating handwashing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about one-third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in episodes of diarrhea can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap is the only effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as automatic behavior is carried out in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the leading ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five years of age, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, instilling the habit of washing hands with soap before meals and after using the toilet could save more lives than any single vaccine or drug mix, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and dying from acute respiratory infections by nearly a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Hand washing can also protect against impetigo that is transferred through direct physical contact.
A minor adverse effect of washing your hands too often is that washing your hands too hard can lead to skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itching, a scaly skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is common among healthcare workers.
Handwashing too often is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times throughout the day where hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transfer of stool to the mouth: after using the toilet (picking, coughing), after cleaning the child's buttocks (changing diapers), before bribing the child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or birds.
Other times when proper hand washing should be practiced to prevent the spread of disease include before and after treating cuts or cuts; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal stools or handling animals; and after holding garbage.
Hand washing with soap is low in most countries.
In 2015, a study of handwashing in 54 countries found that on average 38.7% of households had a practice of handwashing with soap. In 2014, a study showed Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States was almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest rate of 23 percent. Some behavioral change methodologies now exist to improve the practice of handwashing of a country with soap at a critical time. School students were handwashing in groups at a time.
The Essential Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large-scale action to promote the health and education of children.
Worming twice a year, plus washing your hands daily with soap, and brushing your teeth daily with florida.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin can be improved by adding soap or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an efficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are insoluble in water.
However, the proper drainage of water helps with cleaning.
Due to its reusable properties, ketul soap may store bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated kernel soap found the transfer unlikely because the bacteria were removed when washed with foam.
The CDC site still states "liquid soap removed without using hands is better".
Antibacterial soaps get a high promotion to people who are important to health.
There is no evidence to date that using an antiseptic or a recommended disinfectant selects antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistance to organism strains.
So, although antibody-resistant strains are not chosen by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protective agents, this advanced formulation may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and further skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, bulbs, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the Faculty of Public Health at the University of Oregon shows that common soaps have the same effect as antibacterial soaps of the consumer class.
Water is not too hot to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce faster at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, soapy warm water is more effective than soapy cold water to remove natural oils that have soil and bacteria.
Unlike many people believe, scientific studies show that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial content on the hands.
A hand cleanser or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand cleaning agent.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, non-water-based hand sanitizer alcohol rubber (also known as alcohol-based rubber, antiseptic hand rubber, or hand sanitizer) began to become popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated alongside thickening agents such as Karbomer (acrylic acid polymers) into gels, or humectants such as glycerin into liquids, or foams for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohols.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide will further increase antimicrobial activity. A hand cleanser containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol is an efficient germ removal.
Alcohol dehydration kills bacteria, multimedical resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and several viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rubber cleaners containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction 3.5 logs, equal to reduction 35 decibels) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% (reduction 4 to 5 logs) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after use. Hand cleaners are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand cleansers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) types of viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Adequate hand antiseptics or alcohol rub should be used to soak or protect both hands properly.
The front and back of both hands and between the ends of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel becomes dry.
Fingertips should also be well washed, by rubbing them on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands instead of rubbing hand sanitizers, especially when the hands look dirty.
Increased use of this agent due to its ease of use and rapid killing activity of microorganisms. However, it should not replace proper hand washing except in the absence of soap and water.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effects of drying alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused a significant reduction in irritation and dryness of the skin compared to soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol and other substances in alcoholic hand rubs are rare.
The tendency to further reduce irritating contact dermatitis becomes an attraction rather than using soap and water to wash hands.
A non-water agent, though effective, does not clean hands of organic matter. It just disinfects.
This is why hand sanitizer is less effective than soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as the pathogens are still on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends heavily on its ingredients and formulations, and historically it has been less successful than alcohol and alcohol scraping.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohols that have been shown to decrease their effectiveness after use many times, possibly due to progressively inappropriate reactions on the skin.
Most low-income people are not able to have soap, instead they use ash or soil.
Ash or soil may be more effective than using water alone but may be less effective than soap.
Concern exists if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms that may increase rather than reduce the spread of the disease.
Ash is also a soap-like disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap if soap is not available.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends proper hand-washing techniques to prevent disease transmission including the following steps:
Hands are wet with warm or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because the standing basin may be contaminated, at the same time the water temperature does not appear to have an effect.
Wash your hands while rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than just water.
Stir for at least 20 seconds.
Coagulating creates a shift, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and coagulates by longer discarding more germs.
Rinse well with flowing water.
The rinsing in the basin can stain the hands again.
Dry it with a clean towel or let it dry by air.
Wet, moist hands are more likely to become dirty again. The thumb, wrist, the part between the fingers and under the fingernail is the part that is always overlooked.
Microorganisms may be stored in fake nails and peeled nail polish.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent hands from becoming dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are a variety of inexpensive options to facilitate hand washing if there is no tap water and/or soap, e.g. pouring water from hanging cans or pumpkins with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. If the water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as "tippi pipes" and other cheap options.
Tippi pipe is a simple technology that uses a jag suspended with a rope, and a foot-operated lever to pour a little water over the hands and a handful of soap.
An important part of the hand cleaning process is effective hand drying, but there is debate over the most effective form of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more studies have shown that paper towels are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in most bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the level of hygiene when using paper towels, warm air hand dryers and more modern jet air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the number of bacteria at the bottom of the fingertips increased on average by 194% and in the palms by 254%.
Drying with a jet air dryer causes an increase in the number of bacteria at the bottom of the fingertips by an average of 42% and in the palm of the hand by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the amount of bacteria at the bottom of the finished ends is on average reduced to 76% and in the palms to 77%. Scientists also conduct tests to determine whether cross-pollution is potentially occurring from other bathroom users and the bathroom environment of every type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at an alleged speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms out of the hands and units and potentially contaminating other bathroom users and the bathroom environment by 2 meters.
The use of a warm air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels do not show significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study done by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt assessed different methods of hand drying.
The following changes are found in the count of bacteria after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to paper towels for drying.
Hand washing using hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative option when traveling when there is no soap and water.
Alcoholic hand cleansers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Washing hands for medicine had long been an obligation when doctor Ignaz Semmelweis of Hungary discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing illness in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices that warn hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that its use could reduce the rate of infection.
Wash your hands in medicine for at least 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gel to squeeze and rub each part of your hands.
The hands need to be rubbed together with the fingers inserted together.
If there is dirt under the nails, a feather brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, we need to rinse them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying the hands, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open the exit if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting dirty again when touching the surface.
Washing hands in a health care environment is aimed at removing pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and avoiding spreading them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that less permanent hand washing is at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thereby spreading microorganisms.
One study showed proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of blood flow infections related to catheter by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a document showing the standard of washing and rubbing hands in the healthcare sector.
A hand sanitation guide by this organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and confirm hand hygiene, if a demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" to Wash Hands:
After being exposed to the blood/fluid of the body
before the asymptomatic task, and
after treating the patient. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (the soap is "curative" or "antimicrobial") gives the killing action to the hand washing agent.
Such killing acts may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very widespread. In order to 'wash' one's hands for surgical surgery, there should be a pipe that can be turned on and off without touching with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine laundry, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterile brush to rub and other sterile tools to clean under the fingernails.
All items need to be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2-6 minutes.
It takes a long time (10 minutes) to rub.
When rinsing, the water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
After finishing hand washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and surgical shirts are worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic before and after treating a sick person.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit of handwashing comes from the first 20% of washing, and very few added benefits are gained when the frequency of handwashing rises above 35%.
Washing with regular soap produces more than three times the rate of infectious diseases transferred to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand rubbing with an alcohol solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds, each indicates that hand rubbing with alcohol reduces bacterial contamination 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce A H1N1 influenza virus and Clostridium dificil spores out of hand. Interventions to improve hygiene in health care environments can involve education for staff about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and written and oral reminders to staff.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most effective in different health environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and essential tool for achieving good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities at home, at school and at work makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behavior.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing pipes close to each private and public toilet are extremely rare, although there are cheap options available to build hand washing stations.
However, a low rate of hand washing can also be due to an ingrained habit of lack of soap or water.
Promotion and advocacy for hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioral changes in the population.
In order for this to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
A systematic review of 70 studies found community-based approaches to improve handwashing at LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. An example of handwashing promotion in schools was the "Three-Star Approaches" by UNICEP that encouraged schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene conditions.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one to finally three stars,
Developing hand-washing stations can be part of a hand-washing promotional campaign conducted to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns trying to change behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted the use of handwashing emojis.
Several studies have considered the overall cost of hand washing in developing countries related to DALY.
Yet one survey shows that promoting hand washing with soap is much more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health – especially for people in vulnerable conditions such as new mothers giving birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Forence Nightingale, the "modern nursing founder" of England.
At that time most people still believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health care-related infections caused the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more vigorously promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness about in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "right hand-washing techniques" are hung next to hand-washing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands from" something, means declaring one's reluctance to take responsibility for the thing or share involvement in it.
It derives from the Bible verse in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase with more widespread use in some English communities.
In Macbeth by Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth began compulsively washing her hands in an attempt to wash the imagined stain, which represented her guilt feelings about the crime she had committed and that she influenced for her husband to commit.
It was found that people, after recalling or rethinking unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and appreciate hand washing equipment more.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to be involved in other payment "laundering" actions, such as voluntary work.
Religion prescribes hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolically, by using water without soap to wash hands, is part of the hand washing rituals found in many religions including Bahai, Hindu, tevilah and yadayim netilate in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also prescribes clean hand washing especially after certain actions.
Hindus, Jews and Muslims are required to wash their hands after using the toilet.
Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews and Muslims are also obliged to wash their hands before and after meals.
Workplace hazard control against COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is an application of occupational health and safety methodologies for hazard control to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace hazard control depends on work sites and work tasks, based on risk assessments for sources of exposure, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors for each employee who may be exposed to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers, whose basic infection prevention measures are proposed including hand washing, encouraging workers to sit at home if they are sick, breathing ethics, and maintaining routine hygiene and disinfection at work.
Jobs with moderate exposure risk include jobs that require frequent or close contact with people who are unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but may be infected due to contagion in an ongoing community or international travel.
These include employees who have contact with the public such as in schools, work environments with high population density, and some retail environments with high volume.
Danger control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures including ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing controllers, and having personal protective equipment in the event of collision with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare and mortuary workers exposed to people known to or suspected of having COVID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, which increases to a very high risk of exposure if employees perform aerosol production procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from people known to or suspected of being infected with COVID-19.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure and personal protective equipment suitable for work tasks.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have a number of effects in the workplace.
Employees may not be present for work due to illness, need to take care of others or are afraid of being exposed.
Trading patterns may change, both in terms of the goods requested, and how to get these goods (such as spending outside peak hours or through shipping or driving services).
Lastly, shipments of goods from geographical areas directly affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. Preparedness and plans for the response of infectious diseases can be used as a guide to protective measures.
The plan addresses the level of risk associated with a wide range of work sites and occupational tasks including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community environment, and risk factors for each employee such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also outlines the necessary controls to address those risks, and a contingency plan for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Plans of preparedness and response to infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational plan recommendations.
Objectives for response to the outbreak include reducing contagion among staff, protecting people at high risk for severe health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the response taken.
A hazard control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard control according to effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control, and the last is personal protective equipment.
Engineering control involves isolating employees from work-related hazards without depending on employee behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in a work policy or procedure that requires the actions of an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative control but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected on the basis of hazard to the worker, properly installed according to suitability (e.g. respirator), properly worn consistently, constantly inspected, preserved and replaced, if necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs at lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
Recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging employees to sit at home if they are sick, respiratory ethics include closing when coughing and sneezing, preparing tissues and waste containers, preparing for telework or shift work if necessary, discouraging employees from using other people's tools or equipment, and maintaining a cleaning and disinfecting routine at work.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers who have acute respiratory symptoms sit at home until they are free of fever, signs of fever or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing drugs or other symptoms-altering medications, and a flexible sick leave policy, allowing employees to sit at home to take care of sick family members, and employees know about this policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure-risk jobs include jobs that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of an unknown or suspected COVID-19 patient, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the ongoing community transmission around a business location, or because the individual recently traveled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include employees who have contact with the public such as in school, work environment with high population density and some retail environments of high volume. Engineering controls for this group and higher-risk groups include practising air filters with high efficiency, increase ventilation rate, installing physical barriers such as sneeze plastic and rallying windows for customer service. Administrative control for these groups and higher-risk groups practising appliances, including pruning apparing appliances to the apprentices of the apprentices or apprentices, improving the apprentices, increasing the apprentices of the apprentices and the apprentices, installing the apprentices of the apprentices, installing the apprentices, installing the apprentices, installing the apprentices and the apprentices, installing the appliances of the apprentices and the apprentices, installing the apprentices, installing the appliances of the apprentices, the apprentices the apprentices the apprentices, the apprentices the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices the apprentices the apprentices, the apprentices the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apprentices, the apps, the apps, the user the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the user the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps the apps, the apps the apps, the apps the apps the apps the apps the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps, the apps
Workers in this risk group rarely require the use of a respirator.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew to look after the sick person, and giving a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crews should wear disposable medical gloves when treating a sick traveler or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in biohazard bags, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard control includes delaying travel when sick, isolating and notifying the medical center on board immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up measures should be taken in the cabins of isolated people. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been inside the school building regardless of community spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education and choir classes or dining in cafeterias, adding space between tables, staged arrivals and return times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with symptoms such as flu.
When there is a high contagion in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, the extension of school discontinuation can be considered. The CDC considers the overall health risks for members of the enforcer who perform routine activities to be low.
Legal enforcement officers who must make contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 person are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians including proper personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers need to clean and decontain their belts and duty equipment before re-using with sprays or household cleaning wipers, and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for laying and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers health care workers and mortuary workers to be in the high or very high category for exposure risk.
High-risk jobs include health care delivery, support, lab and medical transport workers exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
It becomes a very high risk of exposure if an employee performs an aerosol production procedure on, or collects or handles specimens from a known or suspected COVID-19 patient.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, several dental procedures and examinations, or the collection of invasive specimens.
The high-risk mortuary jobs include employees involved in preparing the bodies of people who are known or suspected of COVID-19 cases at the time of their death; it becomes a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional engineering controls for this risk group include an isolation room for COVID-19 patients who are known or suspected, including when aerosol production procedures are performed.
Ventilation with special negative pressures may be appropriate in some health care facilities and morgues.
The specimen must be controlled with Level 3 Biosafety alertness.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends patients who will enter isolation to different waiting places depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 cases. In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of patients who are known, or suspected, to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol production procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 or better respirators must be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program including fit tests, training and medical exams.
Other types of respirators can provide higher protection and increase employee comfort. WHO does not recommend covering clothing because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that is not spread through body fluids.
The WHO recommends only surgical masks for check-in personnel.
For those who collect respiratory specimens from, treat, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol production procedures, the WHO recommends surgical masks, eye protection, or face protection, protective suits and gloves.
If the aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given the insufficient global supply of PPE, the WHO recommends to minimize the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, by allowing only those involved in direct care to enter the room of COVID-19 patients, using only the necessary PPE for specific tasks, continuing the use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the individual PPE supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for COVID-19 patients.

CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in a very unusual situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes our interconnectedness in the world and the responsibilities we have towards each other become clear.
We haven't had a challenge like this before, but we know that our best response depends on the kind of empathy, collaboration and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern that we have seen among all our colleagues by e-mail, phone and chatter is a remarkable confirmation for the extraordinary human beings we are lucky enough to be able to work together.
I am so grateful and proud to be your partner.
Last week, some people shared their appreciation for our work.
This reminds me of how meaningful the world is today when it comes to referring to Wikipedia, and how powerful it has become because this critical resource remains online and is available to all.
Your work makes all of this possible, whether you keep your website active or your paid co-workers or our community safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially nowadays.
This is a moment that not only what we do but the way we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Coordination to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In the discussion, we considered what we thought would be a response in line with what we were dealing with and the best way to ensure this organization survives at the moment.
Together, we want to eliminate stress and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to slow down a bit, that's okay.
To all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We don't announce holidays - if you can work at regular hours, missions can use you.
However, the world is now unpredictable. Whether you need to take care of loved ones, buy kitchen items or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We won't record your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have been told, but we told him.
There's no need for a sick day or PTO - just tell your manager and help your team review the calendar and schedule to ensure key areas of work are covered.
(If you've been diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan in T<0x26>C Ops so that the T<0x26>C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the appropriate attention from management).
Those who are paid by the hour will be paid in full.
We have notified and affirmed our commitment to honor the commitments of our contractors and staff colleagues who are paid on an hourly basis.
Each person will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be very satisfying to us, especially in times like this.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We only ask you to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can customize it accordingly.
Some work is considered important.
There are some things that we need to keep going.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust <0x26> Security, and Fundraising teams (among them) do critical work that may require additional assistance.
We will begin the process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is important to our mission.
There is so much to do for all of us, we will only focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now won’t hurt later.
We don't plan to move "double to chase what's left behind" as soon as this pandemic passes.
You are not expected to work overtime to meet a deadline that is currently unrealistic.
We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and will strive to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What Happened to the APP?
To adjust to the actual reality and expectations of our daily working hours, we want to adjust the delivery timeline of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to recommend an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgeting to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and care of their loved ones while helping those who need or want to work with reduced working periods for the next few weeks.
The extension of the timeline greatly reduces the workload and stress of current plans throughout the organization.
We will introduce our proposal to the Board next week and will notify representatives and teams of the next steps as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office status, disclosure and cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our SF colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we have hired an antivirus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antivirus solutions to disinfect every surface as well as lobby and elevator systems that reach our level.
The building adopts a distinctive duty-care protocol in using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We felt comfortable that the office would be well-prepared when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which shares COVID-19 protocols with us and all staff members are based in DC.
As of last week, our DC office is turning to remote setup fully in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some NYC-based co-workers know, we're also talking about a one-stop lodging in Brooklyn.
The conversation continues, but may be postponed.
Some of our colleagues worked remotely for the first time.
Our longtime colleagues know that it can be an adjustment and want to give you some advice:
Limit the meeting period to an additional one or two hours at most.
If a longer session is needed, consider ways to divide for a few days.
Determine meetings clearly, have an agenda and send reading material in advance.
Create default videos, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connection.
Having a leader to handle each meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and track the list of speakers, and someone to help to take notes (or do notes collaboratively).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headphones.
Make use of your health care payments for snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties channel in Slack to chat with your co-workers about distributed tasks
The HR Operations team is looking at an ergonomic webinar guide to support improvements in tasks distributed across the Foundation.
Over the past few weeks we have asked all community grant recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editaton until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We tell them that we understand our requests for cancellations and other restrictions may be impossible in completing their agreed grant activities and that no action will be imposed for delaying or modifying those goals.
In the coming weeks we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiment of the entire global community seems to be a grief at the disruption but a relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and vice versa.
Forward, CRT strives to develop a single page about Meta-Wiki to provide space for communities to monitor impact and comply with our communications with them.
Stay in touch with COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time in touch with each other.
We're here together and we're here to help as much as we can.
For now, you can continue to search for information from this email, and all other important COVID-19-related information on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will make sure all of these pages are updated and all the information is in one place.
We also strive to ensure regular communication with staff who are in a highly affected country at the moment.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, or coverage challenges, or any help you need, don't hesitate to inform and collaborate with CRT.
We are here to assist in providing support and being a contact if needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive matters, please email Bryan Judan - Director of International HR Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a waiver of our work and responsibilities.
However, all of this is a recognition at this point, our work and responsibilities may need to be adapted in ways unlike the past.
These are the steps we believe as necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, provide our movements with the support they need, and the world service that they can count on.
Our mission is to wait for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create space for important tasks to arrive in the weeks and possibly months to come.
We need you all to make it a reality, and we need you all to take care of yourself and your family so that you will be at your best when that need arrives.
Now, please... wash your hands and don't touch your face!

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that connects to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 deals with the activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) associated with reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a reliably targeted drug for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as the center of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 is a zinc that contains metaloenzymes located on the surface of the endothelium and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the M2 N-terminal peptidase domain and the C-terminal renal amino acid carrier domain.
ACE2 is a single pathway type 1 membrane protein, with its enzyme domain actively exposed to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer domain of ACE2 cells is attached to the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is twinned on the cell membranes of most type II alveolus cells of the lungs, small intestine entrocytes, arteries and endothelial cells of the veins and soft muscle cells of the arteries in most organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a balancer to ACE.
ACE attaches the hormone I angiotensin to the narrowing of vaso angiotensin II.
ACE2 instead attaches phenylalanine carboxyl-terminal amino acids to angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and its hydrolysis into angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also attach a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]- bradikinin, appelin, neurotensin, dynorfin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the distribution of the neutral amino acid carrier membrane SLC6A19 and is indicated in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as a major entry center into cells for some coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the SARS-causing virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19-causing virus).
In particular, binding to the nail protein S1 for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in the enzymatic domain on ACE2 over cell surface results in endocytosis and the translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosomes is located between cells.
The admission process also requires the infiltration of the S protein by the TMPRSS2 hose serin prosthetic, an inhibitor under current study as a potential therapeutic. This has led some to hypothesize that reducing ACE2 levels in cells may help in fighting infection.
However, various professional associations and regulatory bodies recommend continuing standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia is also reduced for patients treated with ACE inhibitors who have a higher risk for pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality rates, although the results were less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombination of human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to increase pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with induced lipopolysaccharide acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour effect.
Some findings recommend that rhACE2 may be an expected drug for those with intolerance to classic renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases surrounding enhanced angiotensin II.
The b'COVID-19 app is a mobile software app designed to help with contact tracking in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, which is the process of identifying people ("relationships") who may be in contact with infected individuals.
Many applications are developed or proposed with government officials supporting in some provinces and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building relationship tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy concerns are raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of user applications.
Less disruptive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to log user proximity logs on other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check if they have ever had contact with those infected with COVID-19.
It is used across over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is in use.
The app was developed by the local IT community, launched as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopCorona!", an application based on Bluetooth to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide quick feedback to health care authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, apps are awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the relationship tracking app is at an advanced stage of development, and will be available for launch in a few weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geo-restriction applications for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists a number of potential practical problems with applications-based systems, including a false positive and potential lack of effectiveness if the application implementation is limited to only a small percentage of the population.
Dealing with concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple set limits on the type of organization that can add coronavirus-related applications to its Apps Store, limiting them to "authorised" or reputable organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented the same restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed concerns about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, particularly about whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be halted once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement asking to limit such surveillance.
The organization declares eight conditions on government projects:
supervision shall be "legitimate in terms of law, if necessary and proportionate";
Extensive monitoring and monitoring should have embedded clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
data security and anonymity shall be protected and shown as protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid further aggravation of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties shall be defined in law;
to be protected against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Significant engagement by all "relevant stakeholders" should be required, including public health experts and marginalized groups. German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also issue a checklist.
The Google/Apple plan's proposal aims to address ongoing surveillance problems by removing tracking mechanisms from their device's operating system as soon as they are no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking rather than apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have a huge potential privacy problem.
However, not all systems with a centralized server need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy preservation systems have already been created that use a centralized server only for mutual communication (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system is used to track relationships.
Instead of using specific applications, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and the merger of all these generates notices via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to major changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Countries including Germany are considering using a centralized system and privacy preservation.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not been published.
Relationship tracking with privacy preservation is a concept organized with important body review literature dating back to 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working for privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log user proximity on other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinating effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, rather than a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy Preservation Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, FKA Contact Event Number, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocol and Other Relationship Mechanisms (Choleft)
In this protocol, the personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and all the matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy preservation techniques when collecting and using location or data intersections to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technology that was also originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive locations and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by a number of unified groups on equally important methods and large overlapping protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global usability for tracking and warning applications, an important aspect of achieving widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had already made open source for the BlueTrace protocol used by the official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for relationship tracking that they claim will preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy preservation cryptography.
They also publish the core technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system intends to be launched in three stages:
Launch of tools to enable government to create coronavirus-preserving privacy tracking apps
The integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android plans of Google and Apple to address the ongoing implementation and surveillance problems by first distributing the system through an operating system update, and then removing it in the same way as soon as the threat passes.
Repositioning a drug (also known as changing the purpose of a drug, re-profile, re-assignment or therapeutic conversion) is changing the purpose of an approved drug for the treatment of a different disease or health condition from the reason it was originally developed.
This is an ongoing scientific research effort to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and recovery plasma transfer. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 medicated proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analyzing the binding site provides an affordable project to develop effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are proteases such as papain, RNA-dependent polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribophosphatase.

The CDC has said that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said that they use the drug when "there is no other option".
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of the use of hydroxychloroquine prevention.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "clearly effective".

A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no advantages can be observed".
The drug is designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to discover a compound that will bind to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There has been criticism in the scientific community about directing resources to alter the purpose of the drug developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was invented and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against various phylo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronavirus-viruses.
One issue with antiviral treatment is the designation of resistance through mutations that can cause disease and more severe transplantation.
Some preliminary pre-trial studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. There are several clinical trials underway including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and the other for those with more severe disease.
There are three clinical trials underway for intravenous vitamin C for those hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19, two controlled placebos (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).

The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there have been many attempts in progress to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase 1 safety study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The transmission of major epidemics worldwide in 2020, provides investment and proportional research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are using the published genome to develop a possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
Declared in April, the imperative of CEPI's initiative for accelerated vaccine development, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platforms aimed at progressing into Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase 1 developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus vectors (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vectors)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (referred to as in-planning or under-design).
Phase I-II trials perform preliminary safety and immunogenic tests, usually randomly, placebo-controlled and multisite, while determining effective doses more accurately.
Phase III trials typically involve more participation including control groups and the effectiveness of tests on vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 are still in human assessment) are still in "practical" research.

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities gathered resources for supercomputer access from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologic effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits other than their preventable disease.
A randomized trial in Australia was aimed at enrolling 4,170 healthcare workers.
There is a possibility that vaccines in development are not safe or effective.
Preliminary research to assess the effectiveness of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2 transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, suggests the need for stage 3 biosecurity restraint measures to handle live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. Moreover, no vaccine has been proven against MERS.
As MERS spreads widely, existing SARS research is believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy against MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, there is one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that has completed phase I of clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Posts on social media promoted conspiracy theories that claimed the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, lost sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually five days but may start between two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 patients have recovered. The virus is especially spread between humans during close contact, often through small droplets produced through coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets are produced during exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or on the surface instead of being an infection for long distances.
People can also get infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
Viruses can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
Most infectious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and in subsequent stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (cRT-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect themselves of carrying the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the ordinary public are different, with some authorities recommending not to use them, some recommend their use and others oblige their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or virus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease is recorded in most countries throughout the WHO's six regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or exhibit flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and congestion.
Symptoms of anxiety include difficulty breathing, persistent pain or chest pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms appear.
Less commonly, upper respiratory exercises such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarea are observed in multiple percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only data overcrowding and palpitations.
In some, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of patients who show symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected exhibit symptoms.
The role of this asymptomatic carrier in transplantation is still not fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that it may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportions of those infected do not show symptoms are currently unknown and are being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KDCC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain asymptomatic while staying in their hospitals.
China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in their daily cases on 1 April; out of 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a lot of viral load.
Talking loudly gives off more drops than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause droplets to move up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not innate, the National Academic of Science suggests that a possible bioaerosol transfer and an air collector at a position in the hallway outside people's rooms show positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiration secretion to become an aerosol and thus cause congenital spread.
Although there is concern it spreads through feces, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is highly contagious when people are asymptomatic; although the spread is possible before the appearance of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that although it is entirely unclear about how easily the disease spreads, a person infects two to three people in general. The virus persists for several hours to several days on the surface.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable for a day on the cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products weaken the protective layer of viral fat, deactivate it and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant substance) were less effective. In one Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken for median for two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with clusters of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All novel features of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in naturally related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soaps, which leak its protective bubbles. SARS-CoV-2 is almost related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organ most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells through the enzyme-converting enzyme angiotensin (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolus cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface of a glycoprotein called a "nail" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injuries are found in 12% of infected people who are hospitalized in Wuhan, China and more often in severe illness.
High rates of cardiovascular symptoms, due to systemic inflammatory reactions and diseases of the immune system during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are involved in heart function.
High incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to weak prognosis. Autopsies of those who died due to COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolus damage (DAD), and lymphocyte intrusion contains inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for ACE2 expression epithelial cells in the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secretion T cells have been shown to correlate with monocytic inflammatory intake of IL-6 secretion and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic intrusion was also reported during an autopsy.
WHO publishes several testing protocols for diseases.
The standard method of testing is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rPT-PCR).
Tests are usually performed on respiratory samples obtained with a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nose swab or sputum sample may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used but these require two blood samples to be taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate the coronavirus strain and publish a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infections by viruses.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (possibly detecting an active infection and whether a person has been infected in the past) are under development but are not widely used.
China's experience with testing has shown an accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first care start test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University recommend methods for infection detection based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Opacity of bilaterally crushed multilobar glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution is common during early infection.
Subpleural dominance, many pavements (a thickening of the lobular septum with multiple alveolus fillings) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Some data can be found on monoscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung unification and pulmonary edema
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytes, hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, space-between inflammation with lymphocytic invasion and multinucleate giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: damage to the diffuse alveolus (DAD) with diffuse alveolus exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Recovery of pneumonia: the preparation of exudates in alveolus cavity and fibrosis of the space-between pulmonary
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulanization (DIC), leucoeritroblastic reagent
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water and for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the shoulder in the absence of tissue.
Cleanse your hands after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of fabric face coverings in public places, in part to limit evacuation by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups through the closure of schools and workplaces, limiting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include for the public to be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from them.
No medications have been identified as effective at preventing COVID-19. Since vaccines were not expected until at least early 2021, the main thing in managing COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemic’s peak, known as “deflecting the curve”.
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear dirty, before eating or after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
Again it is recommended to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol but only when soap and water are not available. For areas without commercial hand sanitizer, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help get rid of bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not the active ingredient for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects they are carrying the virus to wear a simple face mask.
The oxygenation of the estracorporeum membrane (ECMO) is used to deal with the issue of respiratory failure, but its advantages are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be useful for those with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and China Healthcare Commission have published recommendations to take care of those hospitalized with COVID-19.
Critical care professionals and pulmonologists in the U.S. collect treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care settings when implementing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals taking care of those infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends putting the person in the Congenital Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and built-in precautions. The CDC provides guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended equipment are: PPE gowns, respirators or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators (rather than face masks) are preferred.
The N95 respirator is approved by the industry settings but the FDA has already allowed masks to be used under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
It is designed to protect against innate particles such as dust but is effective against specialized biological agents not guaranteed for off-label use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face protectors or as a final option, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but some percentages require it.
This type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related to respiratory failure is being actively studied for patients in hospitals with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high-flow nasal cannula or two-stage positive airway pressure.
Whether these two provide the same benefits to critically ill people is unknown.
Some doctors choose to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are usually frequent in older adults (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of the health system to handle a sharp increase in the number of severe enough COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% of those admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilator support and 1.4% died.
In China, at least 30% of patients in hospitals with COVID-19 will eventually be admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators are capable of controlling pressure and high PEEP is needed to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of ventilator-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on ventilators for longer.
Research for potential treatment began in January 2020, and some antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears to be the most expected.
While new drugs may take until 2021 to be developed, some of the drugs currently being tested have already been approved for other uses.
Antiviral drugs may be tested on people who have severe illnesses.
WHO recommends volunteers participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA gives temporary permission for plasma recovery as an experimental treatment in case for their lives that are serious or vulnerable.
It has not yet gone through the necessary clinical studies to show it is safe and effective for disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID.
The app can detect 'close contacts' using surveillance data and thus the risk of potential infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also warns local health authorities. Big data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people they connect to in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of those infected with the coronavirus.
Steps are taken to enforce quarantine and protect those in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutche Telekom shared aggregate phone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia is implementing facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italian provincial health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people continue to move around".
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid called on the global for a creative solution to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience stress as a result of quarantine, travel restrictions, the effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying. "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession is the perfect thousand that harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease will cause mild effects with little or no symptoms, resembling a common upper respiratory disease such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness take three or six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may be at high risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but the data for COVID-19 is lacking. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs that cause pneumonia.
In most of those severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly become acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal freezing and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Abnormal freezing, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, has been evident in as many as 6% of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function was observed in 4% of this group.
At least 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, with five days spent for hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospital admission and death.
In the initial case study, the median time from the appointment of early symptoms to death was 14 days, with full coverage of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of post-mortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolus damage with exudate cellular fibromisoids in both lungs.
Changes in viral cytopathy are observed in pneumocytes.
Images of the lungs show acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was observed with increased troponin levels or cardium stalls.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those admitted to hospitals with existing health conditions, the availability of regional medical and socioeconomic resources may also have an impact on mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality rates from conditions differ due to their territorial differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The lower count of light cases can lead to overestimation of the death rate.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by cases of infection in the past can mean the current death rate is overestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have at least 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers. Concern has been voiced about long-term follow-up of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some patients recovering from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.
This may also lead to the syndrome after intensive care is followed by recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known if the infection previously provided effective and long-term immunity in those who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but in cases with recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a positive test for the coronavirus at a date that has been reported.
All of these cases are believed to be worse with prolonged infections than with re-infections.
Viruses are considered to be natural and come from animals, through overindulgence infections.
The exact origin is unknown but as of December 2019 the transmission of the infection as a whole was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study for the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest start date of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are usually used to measure mortality rates.
These figures vary by region and time and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the period since the initial transmission and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO designated the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for death from laboratory-certified SARS-CoV-2 infections and U07.2 for death from SARS-CoV-2 infections without clinically diagnosed or epidemiological laboratory confirmation. Death ratios compared to cases reflect the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The total varies by region. Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed to die from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) individuals who die from the disease.
These statistics are not subject to time and conform to a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not everyone develops antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about the number of people infected.
At the center of the epidemic in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) has died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread by Carnival parties, and transmission to younger people, causing comparatively lower mortality rates, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially classified as such.
The German health system has not yet been overridden.
In the Netherlands, at least 3% may have antibodies as assessed by a blood donor.
69 (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its death rate varies for both men and women.
The mortality rate was higher for men in the study carried out in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is those in their 50s, with the gap between men and women arousing only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact reasons for these sex differences are unknown but genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
The immunological differences based on sex, lack of prevalence of smoking in women and men forming co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals are men and 72% of the total deaths due to COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked sex-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that blues diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on men and women.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women and they have a higher exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the abbreviation CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for the time when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographical locations (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, in accordance with international recommendations for naming is intended to avoid stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the WHO uses the "Covid-19 virus" and the "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both diseases and viruses are commonly referred to as "coronaviruses".
During the initial transmission in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were commonly referred to as "coronaviruses" and " Wuhan viruses".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in line with 2015 guidelines on location use for diseases and virus names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers manufacture health care materials such as nose swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needs an immediate ventilator valve, and the supplier can't deliver it in the required time scale, a local engineering novice turns around and produces 100 required valves overnight.
After the initial spread of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and incorrect information emerged regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread online quickly.
Humans are able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral imitation in pigs, ducks and chickens.
There are no medications or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being undertaken by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated a "Solidarity Trial" to assess the effects of treatment of four current antiviral compounds with the most expected effectiveness.
There are no vaccines available but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous efforts on SARS-CoV are being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under investigation.
First, researchers are aiming to build the virus vaccine as a whole.
The use of the virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at gaining immediate immune response in the human body against new infections with COVID-19.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, is to create a vaccine that is sensitive to the immune system of some virus subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research focused on the protein S that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a novel technique for creating a single vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies should be tested for safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic codes copied from viruses that cause disease. Increased reliance on antibodies is proposed as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials have already been approved as treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Purpose-altered antiviral drugs cover most of China's research, with nine phase III trials of remdesivir for some countries to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates is available, as of April 2020. Several current antiviral drugs are being assessed for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir as of Mach 2020.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with the use of remdesivir lovingly.
Phase III clinical trials were conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, used to treat malaria previously studied in China in February 2020, gave preliminary results.
However, there is a call for a review of the research equivalent.
The Korean and Chin authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, admits that double the dose is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use permits for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of medical experts treating those infected with COVID-19. China's 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to induce SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for advanced in vivo studies after showing low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early increased protein sedation by transmembrane protease serina 2 (TMPRSS2) is important for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine together or without azithromycin have major limitations that prevent the medical community from using this therapy without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms can be a complication in the next stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has anticytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing a non-random phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, this means to counteract such developments, which are considered the cause of death for some infected people.
Interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroidal refractory cytokine release syndrome influenced by different causes, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, there is no randomly controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those recovering from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method for passive immunization.
This strategy was tested on SARS with no conclusive results.
Virus neutralization is a mechanism of action in which passive antibody therapy can be an intermediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms however, such as cellular toxicity reliance on antibodies and/or possible phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced are in development.
The production of the recovery serum, which consists of the fluid portion of the blood of the recovered patient and contains specific antibodies on the virus can be increased for faster execution.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, was later infected and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
