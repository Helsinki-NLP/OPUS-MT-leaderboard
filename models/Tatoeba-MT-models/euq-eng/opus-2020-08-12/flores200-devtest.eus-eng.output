We can begin to live in a purer way of life, we can meet with mobilization for the surroundings, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to a certain amount of future suffering.
It's like sympathetic treatment in many cases. But if we want only the temporary solution, we need to find the origin of problems so that we can fix them.

The traffic flows between the driver and the individual vehicles and the flows of traffic between them.
