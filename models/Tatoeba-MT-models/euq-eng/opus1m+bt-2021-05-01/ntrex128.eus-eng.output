The members of the assembly of Wales have stated their concerns because they will take them as a croquet?
Some of the partners of the Union have stated a disadvantage to change their name as MWP (Galestic Lawy).
This idea has been created after we have developed plans to change the name of the assembly of the Galese Act.
The members of the political council are concerned with this plan because it's a good thing to laugh at.
A member of the Laborist Party on the cross has said - Of the Words of Twp and Pwp?
If you're outside Wales, it means Twp.
In his part, a member of Scotland has said that the whole group is not very happy - and has suggested to search for names instead.
Again, a member of the conservative party in Wales said - opened up to the new ideas, but also explained his uneasiness for the rites that might bring MWP changes.
In order to understand this conflict, it must be considered that the English letters of Wales and Yorkshire are similar letters.
Besides, the commissioner of the assembly, who is making the legal draft of making changes of names, said: \"In regard to the members of the Union, they will have the sole care to choose the descriptions they intend to use.\"
The assembly of Wales, according to the custom of the 2017th of the government of Wales, has power to change its name.
In June he published the results of a public consultation which had been suggested by the proposal, and in general the law of Wales received many statements of union.
With regard to the names of the fellow-citizens, Commissioner was chosen by the Galesians or WMP (in the sigl) but the name of MWP was decided in a public consultation.
On the other hand, the members of the Union suggest a substitute opportunity, but it may be extremely difficult to choose an opportunity with one mouth; especially for Presidentes, Elin Jones, who has had to send you a few weeks with changes.
But the legislature of changes that will be done will affect the action of the assembly; and the rest will cause a rule to avoid the action of the members of the Union, and the system layout of the assembly will be handled with the help of that law.
When the change of legislation is disputed, the members of the Union will be allowed to decide on their names.
The Macedonians will be parted in a refrigeratorium to change the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday and decide whether the country's name is under the name of the Republic of Macedonia?
With Greece (which has a province named Macedonia) it is arranged to solve the great account of the last tencades which have been made to be solved by Greece.
The government of Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring people in the North is a reinforcement of its country, and has long been prevented from entering the Union of Europe and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is an enemy of the plebiscence, said that he will not see the vote.
Nevertheless, the followers of the Reverendum (including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev), say that it is only the price of getting into EBan and NATO.
The bells of San Martin church lose their voice from the affairs of the churches of Harlem.
-I have spoken with the aged people so long, and they say you could find a tavern and a church in all corners - - it means Mr. Adams.
Today, there's nothing at all?
He says the disappearance of the tablets is normal.
- People use other methods to socialize?
- The bartenders are no longer the neighboring rooms used to meet people?
As to Eliza, he's worried that the money you got for the hots will not be enough for the sales, and we'll be back at the beginning point first or later -
and the churches may be replaced with houses, and the temples of the neighbourhood will be built by persons who do not care to take care of them.
- People who are going to buy the apartments of property will be white people - and so the churches will be shut up because they are not the members of the church congressions?
The congressions of white people built before a black Harlem metropoliti was the unit of Metropoli in 1870 and built a decade of San Martin.
In 1930, the original congressive congression went from the neighborhood.
After that, a Regression of black people took the relevoir.
Revendor had taken the black congression of John Howard John Johnson's, and Howard organized a booty against the 125ent street of Harlem, who didn't hire or climb the black people who didn't hire or climb.
In 1939, the church had so many damages, but Father Johnson's churches designed to build up several plans again, and made the carrillage.
Reverendo David Johnson, the son of Johnson, and the heir of San Martin, called the bell of the poor driver -
The listener who rang the July gave him another name -- the treasure of the curb -- and the invincible historical -
Agend, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, has also stated that it has been the first carrier of a black musician in the whole world, the musicians, Dionysius A.
Mr. Merriweather explains that San Martin has not replaced his musician.
In the last few months, St. Martin has seen several artifacts of architecture and counteracting, some of those that are brought by lander leaders or bishops.
The controversy of the Parrotians (a corporation composed of Lacrificial arts), on the other hand, sent a letter to July by the contractors, to make sure that the costs will be passed to parish - because the parrot has nothing to do with the architects and contracts sent by the architects.
Some ecclesiastics present their complaints for the lack of the transparency it has given them.

The scheme for supermarket Sainsbury is entered into the cosmic markets of the United Kingdom
The supermarket Sainsbury's supermarketed hand has taken Boots, Superdrugs, Debenhams stores, and now offers several experts of beauty and specialisation.
As long as the sales of the Mods and domestic product are diminished, 2,8 millions have been invested in the sector of the United Kingdom, which is increasing without limitation, the greater herds of beauty will be constructed and tested at 11 dates of the country. If the results are good, they will be opened in the next year.
Thanks to the investments of beauty, TVs, microwaves, and domestic products can take advantage of the superimposes they sold.
According to Sainsbury's supermarkets, he's gonna double the offers of their beauty and offers more than 3,000 products, Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. Pawaw.
As for L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees Marks, there will be more room in marked fields like those areas which can be found in Boots.
Besides, the supermarket presents his zenity-Boutique, which is a completely vegetative product, the more young buyers require such products.
Besides, Frragance Shop will test the producers at two of Sainsbury's supermarkets; the first was open at Croydon (on the South of Londres), and the second, Selly's (Birmingham) will open at the end of the year.
It is the cause of the purchase of online purchases, and of buying food in small stores every day, that superimposes must work their heads and ears to attract the customers.
Mike Coupe, the manager manager of Sainsbury's supermarketed manager, said that the sales porters will take a style of great leaps, and that supermarket chains will reduce the services and the threatening of their competitors.
The supermarket Sainsbury's superintendent opened the Argos in hundreds of shops and opened the Habitas for two years ago, which, by the way, the sale of food has been established and profitable to them, are more profitable than the chains they have purchased.
The supermarket tried to open up the collections of beauty and medicine again, but the strategy failed.
Then he joined Sainsbury's Boots at the beginning of the year 2000, but this association ended because the process of diverging the profits in the supermarkets had been burned.
A new strategy was organized when the supermarket Sainsbury's supermarket sales sold his 281 decades to Celesion, which belongs to the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, 125 million years ago.
The Lloyds will have a function in the arrangemental plan: a large collection of luxury that can be guarded by the skin will be added to four stores, while the rest are La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, accompanying supermarket directors of Sainsbury's supermarkets, said, \"We improved the look of beauty so our clients can find the best environment.\"
We have also hired great experienced employees to provide detailed advice with the products.
We designed our set of marks to fill up all the requirements, and, thanks to the comforts and easy positions, our models of beauty offer a modern and easy choice in front of those who use the obsolete methods?
Peter Jones:%haint - is Holly Willughby, after he's abandoned the 11 million francs offer.
Dragons Den Star Peter Jones-had gone? Holly Willughby TVrs, after leaving an offer related to 11 million francs an offer related to the history of 11 million francs, to Mark and Spencer and ITV.
Willougby won't have time for Truly selling home products and components.
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Patrow's Goop Mark.
At This Morning, 37, Instagram used to introduce his resignation.
By the resignation of Holly Willugby's division to accept the contracts offered by Marks and Spencer and ITV enpres, Dragons - the star of Den program was very angry at the very moment when he had done his business with them.
By our source, on Tuesday, a sudden meeting was made at the head of the Marlow squad, and, by the way, Jones-he was angry when he heard the description of the most famous woman in our TV-that he would accept the new contracts of 1,5 million francs, and that he could no longer spend any more time on the products of Truly's house and components.
The business is compared to Gwyneth Patrow's Goop Mark and doubles the number 11 million francs of Willoughby's 11 million.
When Willughby, in 37, left Truly's business in Instam, Jones left the U.S.A. went out to a house on holidays.
A source said, \"It's always been among Holly's priorities.
By this decision, the future of the two tencades will be confirmed.
However, the decision to give us the mark has been made out of our mouths.
No one could believe what had happened to Tuesday, for it was when he was closing the mark.
And even more, the Marlow Research store is full of products to sell?
According to the view, millions of francs are about to go to This Morning (which is the most income of the United Kingdom); the company has invested a great deal in several products (otherwise, cushions, candles, and products) and home products will have to be regenerated.
Again, this conflict may be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughtby and his husband Dan Baldwin have three children and his wife, Tara Capp, ten years old.
Wilghby and Cappie made the Truly mark on 2016 and Jones, 52, 52, had entered March as the director.
Two couples always organize their holidays together and have 40 percent of the TV center in Baldwin.
It's going to be the ambassador of Wilghby Môt McPartlin, and replaces the I'm the I'm of the I'm of the I'm Clebrity program.
A source of Jones reported last night-that he wouldn't say anything about his businessmen?
That's a bad conversation, yes, but then we became sorry?
He was jesting about the bad words he was supposed to bear because of the Communications, commenting all about the leadership of North Korea.
Why the President Trump gave you such things?
Trump used his -thetele-general - his voice to answer his waistcoat:
- I didn't give him anything.
After the first meeting made of the Singapore, Mr. Trump said that he wanted to arrange a second meeting and that, thanks to that, a step very important is taken in the direction of the nuclear arm of the North Korea.
However, the nuclear unarmed process stopped.
After the meeting and three months of June, the leading diplomats of the North Korea, Riong Ho, who told the leaders of the NBE, in general meetings made on Saturdays, the North Coast has not seen any appropriate answer from the United States, in regard to the steps of the Ionian armament.
Instead, the punishments established by the United States have been severed to the preservation of the country.
Trump, on the other hand, has a more positive approach and has declared that in the last speech.
-The relationship with the North Korea is better than ever? he said.
- Anyway, we were at a declaring war with North Korea?
They could kill millions of people in this war.
But now we have this extraordinary relation between our hands?
Besides, the efforts to improve Kim's relations have been brought to good results; others have finished the tests done with the missiles, the process of releasing the hostages is improved, and the retarding of the rest of the United States has begun.
He also explains his extraordinary point of view in regard to the conversations with Kim.
- It's easy to see the President's work, but instead of having 100,000 people who want to get into the country, we have 200 people here - he said he pointed personally.
The Indonesia, and the earthquakes have destroyed an island and killed hundreds of
After Lombok had landing, for instance, the help of uninhabited institutions was not necessary.
Although the 10 percent of the population of Lombok had been shifted, the earthquake was not declared as a national disaster (a precondition is required for assistance).
-In so many cases, as it were, the government said clearly that no international support was needed, so this is a challenge - says Mrs. Sumbung.
Save's organization of Child is forming a group going to Pallau, but the volunteer still doesn't know that the volunteers can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, the representatives of the agency of national disasters, according to the statement that the officers of Indonesia are working in Palermo to allow the support of international agents.
Indonesia, though it endures so many earthquakes, the country has, in order to resist the rage of nature.
The fortifications against the Tsunamis are built, but there are still too few forts on the coast.
Palou doesn't have the try to warn people, even though they're in a warning, maybe they're so dead.
When the weather is good, traveling among the Indonsia islands may be a challenge.
Furthermore, natural ruins hardens the efforts to implement the logistical.
A hospital sea was anchored with Lombok, and now goes to the Pala; but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the disaster.
Wedo President's campaign on the Indonesia substructions of Indonesia was founded on projects and invested a lot of money to improve the roads and railroads.
However, the funds have been reduced, and the administration of the President is in a narrow state of the year as soon as the election of the year comes.
Mr. Games have problems to control the tyranny of the Indonesium secrecy, e.g. most members of the reflexion have taken a more conservative standpoint of religion.
Therefore, more than 100,000 persons have died, and ten thousands have lost their houses, because the banks of the Christians and the reflections have been carried into the streets; others, the machetes, the bows, the arrows, and the like are used.

State of Parliament Cromwell - To renew history - is the final goal of inclination
If this disappears, justice will be poetical-as Talibans destroyed so many religious objects, the puritanic phantoms of England did the same with various historical and cultured objects in the country.
But Mr. Cromwell is a suggestion of Mr. Crick's comment - he's trying to renew history?
John Goldsmith, the representative of the Cross-Cromwell, said, \"It is an influential dispute about the dissolution of the Oliver Cromwell statues outside the palace, which are not yet an objective Cromwell.
Cromwell has never asked or organized the miniature of the civil wars in England.
Maybe we should sacrifice another Cromwell for his ancestors, Thomas, his actions on the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive picture of Cromwell, part of the 19th century's opinions and the story of ours, and so many people still believe that the actions of that person must be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said this to the Sunday Telegraph newspaper, less people than in the age of age, but many people still believe that it was a defendant of the Cromwell Parliament against foreign pressures; in this case, we are now talking of a monarchy.
The substance of historical discussions will remain the exact representation of the person.
Nevertheless, we may safely say that a conflict in the midst of the age of 17th has been the starting point of the development of our country, and that the famous Cromwell was part of the parties who had taken part in that part of it.
-Lorda Protector - may even be reason to celebrate and remember all achieved achievements with title?
A pig kills a Chinese peasant.
A pig attacks a peasant and has killed him in the south market of China, according to the means of local communications.
-In Yuan - he's found the man whose name is dead, his body had an art cut off, and he was soaked in blood in a markethouse of the Guizhou Province Liupshuanshu, according to the paper of South Chinaming.
On May 30, 2005, the pigeon fits for embroidered pigs in China's Qingi province.
Normally, on Wednesdays, he travels from the province of Yunnan to sell his cousin to 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the body of the dead man and saw that the side shop door was open.
He also declared that there was a great pig in the pig's mouth in the pig's mouth.
The report of the court analysis has confirmed that 550 francs had been killed by the peasant.

By burning security cameras, you can see how to enter the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
They found his body one hour later.
The animal that killed him wasn't at Yuan or his cousin's.
The pig is locked up to avoid more attacks and to let the police collect the evidence of the police.
The Yuan's family and the market leaders are negotiating for his death.
Despite the odds, some pig attacks have been registered before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the Msachusetts farm, and the man took serious wounds.
Ten years before, a pig of 650 francs surrounded a peasant from Wales in his dealer until the wife of a man's wife disappeared.
In 2012, the pigs of a peasant in Oregon ate his body, and after that, a peasant from Manitoba on the news of CBC News isn't a waging animal, but if they taste blood, it can function as an advocate.
- They love playing.
They're just like the kids and they're very curious. They don't want to hurt you.
\"You need to show me respect,\" he said.

Wherever there are places in the desert, 1-4-inch dangerous waters, the sudden floods, the floods of dishes, and the earthly streams.
The rains created by great tropical humps can water 2-3 inches, and in particular places; especially in the South Nevada and the South of Arizona.
In South West we hope to collect 2-4 inches, especially in Arizona.
As tropical rains are on the side, they can produce sudden floods and dispersal conditions.
It is not recommended to go to the desert if a tropical storm is given.
The rainfalls may make the rocks heavy streams and the storms can bring the winds of the waves and the dust.
Besides, the pressure is going down, there will be rainbows in the south coasts of Califernia.
It's raining and it'll be half-in-inch water and it'll be possible to create small dishes and staggering roads.

More than 20 million people have seen the declaration of Brett Kavanaughen
More than 20 million people saw in the sixth-channel News of the Supreme Court Candidate Brettt Kavanaughen and Christine Blasley Ford's declaration, the latter accused Kavanagh for the sex work of 1980s.
In the meantime, the political conflict followed, and the precincts of the channels interrupted the final Friday program to give a last minute's program-the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake agreed to make an inquiry with FBI for a week.
According to the magistrate of the Senate, Kavanaugh was quite certain that he was drunk and tried to undress his dress in a high school party.
Kavanaugh had said that it was quite certain that it hadn't happened.
According to Nielsen's data, about 20.4 million people touched the statement on Friday.
The company calculated the average of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Changel and MSNBC channels.
However, this number was not made for the other channels at once available, while the others, the PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Bussi-Ntwork.
Besides, Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who watch TV in the offices.
For an example, we can say that the number of spectators can be compared with a fund of football or with the recompenses of Academy.
As for Fox News Channell, there is a very acceptable declaration of Kavanaugh in the channel, and above all the declaring that he had been 5,69 million spectators, Nielsen said.
The second ABC was with 3.26 million inspectors.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC got 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million, and CN2 was 2.52 million, depending on Nielsen.
After the declaration, the public interest remained.
It was the drama of Flake Friday.
When the government of the moderate republican Party announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNNN and CBS channels recorded Kavanaugh on Friday to take a manifest elevator in the direction of Magistrate.
He saw himself directly in the CN Channel looking down as the marshals quarrelled.
-I'm here, in front of you - a woman said.
- Do you really think it's true?
And he added, \"You have a mighty power, but many women have nothing.\"
Before he closed the doors of the elevator, Fla said that his office had published a notification and that he would give more details in the meeting.
The chains of cable and television were sending directly every hour the inspection, while the Magistrate-he voted for the sentence to be the Senator Kavanaugh.
Nevertheless, Fla said he would vote after the arguments against the candidate for a week, and remember that he was asking the democrat to do so.
After talking to his friend Chris Coons Senator democrat, Fla had hardly thought of anything.
When Fla had spoken to Coons and so many senators, Fla made her final decision.
Flaka's decision was powerful, because the Republican votes are not sufficient to allow Kavanaugh.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation to examine arguments that are against Kavanaugh.

There is a great nervous anxiety in this country where it seeks to find independence, after the election of October at the 1st, which was illegal in the government of Madrid, but it was a day to celebrate the Independents of the Catalan.
Most of the voters voted for independence, but the citizen's share was very small because of the number of people who wanted to share the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, 1000 wounded after the attack of the police, because the voters went to stop the voters at the election, so they made violent quarrels.

Narcis Termes, 68, is an electricist, and he went with his wife to the independentation, and he said that Catalonia has no hope of independence.
We spent a wonderful moment last year.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck - he said.

Meng's throwing through Livingston wins 1-0 in front of Rangers
Dolly Meng's first skirt has confirmed the height of Livingston
Livingston was impressed by the Rangers and Steve's Warrd makes his second failure as commander of the Ibrush Club.
Dolly Meng's launch was decided that the Gay Hubbernian party was climbing up the second part.
The warder team remains unpaid during this period of Premiership and against Herts Leader (which has eight points more) on the next Sunday.
Before that game, Rangers will have to play with Rapid Vindna on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Livingston team is not defeated, and there are six games left for this time; the Holt coach does not know what the failure is since the last month the Kenny Miller was replaced by Kenny Miller.
Livingston loses a lot of chances in front of the strongest visitors.
He had to face the Holts' team before he went in; he has a terrible right to the Rangers, and he has a number of problems.
Scott Robinson went on, but all his efforts were lost in front of the door and then Alan Lithgow turned his efforts to the door after Craig Halke's head.
The guests were satisfied that they should be playing the Rangers, but they knew that the visitors might be bothered by any means.
And in that mood there came a solemn punctual punctual.
Rangers had given a free throw and Livingston produced an open space, declan Gallagher and Robinson were combined, but this last time, if he touched the ball, he put the skirt in the middle of the door.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers was dependent on the group, but the family defense was incomprehensible, and the porter Liam Kelly spent the game without trouble.
This example went on in the middle of the second part, but the throw of Alfredo Morels asked for Kelly's full skill.
Scott Pittman couldn't mark the gorilla for Alangers' porter McGregor and Lithgow avoided Livingston' play.
The walks went back into Livingston's area and the house players took out again and again, and asked for two regrets for defiance of Halt Glant's representative, and the other one held the ball with his hand, but they turned aside.
Livingston Game - Amusing - a analysis
Scotland BBC
It was Livingston's unique game and the result was perfect.
They've made extraordinary gestures for me, and they've made great choices to climb up the steps.
The style of game and group has almost not been changed since they arrived at the first level, but Holt has been an unusual coachman, which has been set up directly since it arrived.
He had several heroes.
Captain Halkettt's work has been terrible, organized and handleed, Menga has been responsible for Connor Goldson and Joe Word all the time.
Rangers didn't have much inspiration, though.
When they're at wards they work very well, but they've forgotten the standards they've established.
The last scene has been too weak, and only once they have defeated the family's defense, the Rangers must be quick out of the middle of the board.

Trump expressions in West Virginia
The President scrutinized the situation and mentioned the situation about Brettt Kavanagh, which he had chosen from the Supreme Court, in the middle of the election of the Republicans.
- Everything we've done has been playing in November.
We have five weeks of the most important election in our life.
He's one of the great -- but I'm not candidate, because I am, that's why I'm in every place to deal with great candidates - he said.
Trump added, - you can see the terrible group of Democrat's ends, and you can see what's going on there.
And there is no doubt that they should take away the power of using any necessary resources, see the celebrity, the waiting.
They don't care who hurt them, who goes over them to control and get power, so we don't give them that.
Democrats said, \"They have purposes to stop and disturb.

Laborists won't survive the great irons.
It is intolant with those who say what they think
When the actibists voted against me in my place, there was no great surprise.
I'm the last of the list of unsuccessfully welcomed from Laboristen's MPs for telling you what we thought of.
John Ryan, my partner in Parliament, received a treatment like that, because he had spoken for anti-semitism.
In my case, the censorship of censorship had criticised me to avoid being agreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of an economic renouncing policy, in the security of the nation, in Europe, the leaders of the country did not agree in matters like that.
We want the meetings about the East Notingham meeting on Friday - we want them to have pleasurable and productive meetings. -
During the eight years I've been carrying Toky Labourt's MP, that was Friday GC meeting.
Unfortunately, at this time, it has never been remembered that politicians, respectable-to-do word for ever.
It remains at the same time that there are different aspects of the laborist side, and that opinion is allowed to the leaders of the party.
When Jeremy leader became the leader, we had the same political views to turn into the 180 degrees, and I would never admit that when they began to accept the views, - both with the safety of the nation and the only market in America.
Every time I spoke in public -- it doesn't matter what I said -- a lot of views between the middle political networks and what I wanted to get rid of, as they say, of what I shouldn't have to be in the Laborist Party.
That's not just my experience.
For I know that I have better luck than some of my fellows, because the opinions which have been thrown against me are political.
Every day I depend on those who are to resist the sexism or the race with professionalism and honesty, but never with shame, but not with friends who are to face.
It is one of the most disagreeable parts of this time that it is considered as a normal level of revolt.
Jeremy Corbyn, the Laborist party he announced the previous week, should raise it to the culture of Tolerance.
In fact, we don't get the single opinion - when privation is made tighter in each corner or the rules of the party.
For the last two years, I've had a lot of notes to get down on my head so I wouldn't talk so much, so I'd be - saying.
But I'm not in politics for that.
Thatcher's carelessness drove me down the room, and I entered public services that needed me most, as a local counselor or the minister of the government.
I have never concealed my political beliefs, not in the last edition.
No one in the East Notingham will doubt about my political point of view, and the disadvantages I have now with the leaders.
I shall say to those who have reinforced the mutation of the Friday, when the country is addressed to our houses, to Brexite, and to the public services, I do not understand that I lose time and energy in dispute with the leaders of the lab party.
But my real message is not to push Notingham, but to my electors, whether it be a member of the Laborist Party, I am very proud of working for you, and I promise you, that I will not leave me to work for your best interest, nor with Political threats.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is the leader who has not yet lost a game.
The two last games of surprise had changed the final result, but no doubt Ayr deserved triumph on the wonderful and amusing game of Tennent Champion.
They're on the first rank of the board, and they're the only ones who haven't lost a ten.
In the end, they had a better defence, and the chances they had taken better advantage of, the house and Peter Murchie's coachmen have a perfect right to be happy.
\"We've been tested until now, and we haven't lost one, so we have to be happy!\" he said.
And Robyn Christes of Melros added: \"My honors to Ayr, because they used the choices better than we did.\"
The trial of Grant Anderson's 14th minute, Frazier Clem, before he put Ayr, but the yellow note that had been taken from Captain Rory Hughes, left by Warrors for the game, had given him points, and Jason Baggont had not managed to solve it.
Climo had prevented the leadership of Ayr by repentance. After the first part, he had worked his only job and Ayr 17-5 went to rest.
But Melrose began the second part, and Patrick's rehearsal of Anderson, the Baggot, with five points, had reduced the difference.
Then there was a long pause because of the terrible levity of Ruaridh Knott, which took him out of his hand and arrived at Ayr when he returned to the game when Stafford McDowall's enslavement turned into Climony.
Then they took out the yellow card from Blair Macperson Ayr, and again Melros had done more of a man who had done more good to him than to the trial of Bruce Colvine.
The house came back and, when Struan Hutchinson had pulled out his yellow card to prevent Clem's ball from stopping him, MacPherson strode forward from the line, touched the floor behind the board of the Ayr Group.
Climotto strangled him, as he had done from the beginning, at the fifth session of the house Kyle Row had caught David Armstrong's kick, and Gregor Henry pulled his wings out of his house.
Still Game's star will start a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Actor in Ford Kira wants to jump into the world of hostage, because he has been informed that they have been named the director of a restaurant chain.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis's paper at the famous sight of BBC, together with the Greg Hemphills who have been a writer and one of the stars.
The couple announced that the next period of the show will be the ninth, and it seems that Kiernan Craiglangen is planning the rest of his life.
On official records, Adriftmorn is the director of Limited.
The actor didn't want to say anything about the story, though Scottish Sun magazines said Kiernan Glasgow that he wanted to put in a mark of most important things?
\"The sea is ours,\" said Bolivia, \"the courtroom expects to reopen the road to Pazifico.
The main house of seamen's patrols in La Pazen.
The public buildings have a blue flag.
From Lake Ticcacaa, in the bases of the Amazon ships, can be read: - The sea is our right.
Rebuilding it is our duty.
During the inner Bolivia, the XIX rustle wars on the coast of the century are still alive because they still want to sea in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps stronger than at the last tencades now, because Bolivia expects to solve the courts after five years of October.
-Bolivia has a good time, with a sense of solidity and tranquillity, and of course she waits for the result, says Roberto Calzadilla, the Boliviar diplomatic diplomat.
Many Bolivians will continue by means of the gigantic screens divided throughout the whole country, because the court court court will give the right to the demands of the Bolivia -- after the negotiation which lasted the decades - has been forced to necessitate the supreme path to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charming president of the Bolivia, who has made several remarks about the Monday resolution that has been selected next year.
-We are very ready to return to the Pacific Ocean, he said at the end of August.
Some of the analysts think that the court will not decide for Bolivia, and therefore it will not change much.
The United Nations of the United Nations at Herbeheres has no power to provide for the land of Chile, and has stated that it will not determine the results of the negotiations which may be in it.
The international court's solution means negotiation was over and six months later - it wasn't difficult, Paz Zarat, an expert in international law.
And they've turned backwards for the last four years before Bolivia's cause.
-The subject of coming to the sea has been taken as prisoner by the administration of the Bolvian, said Zarat.
President Morales' rhetoric has spoiled all desire to do well in Chile.
The Bolivia and the Trolls are still going to play so many subjects, but it will be very difficult to keep discussing them.
Two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The President, Edward Rodrígue Velzé, the representative of Bolivia, is not agreed to those who say that the court resolution is particularly clever.
On Monday Bolivia is going to have a great chance to reconcile the Chile with -- and to finish 139 years of indifference, he said for both of them.
Calzadilla declared that Morales didn't agree with one of the Presidentes of South America that still use a political support for the sea.
-Bolivia will never renounce the right of getting to the Pacific Ocean?
- It's the chance we should see the decision through the past?
North Korean says that nuclear will not happen until he can believe in America
The Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong Hoe says his country is not disarmed until he can believe in Washington.
That was before the General of the United Nations.
He asked the United States on the summit of the Singapore, before the leaders of the enemy, to fulfill the promise.
He declared that Mike Pompey is a Secretary of the United States in the North Korea of the Sinpair Mike Pompey is more than three months of diplomacy to block the nuclear diplomat.
Rik - it says that the followers of chastises and the War of Korea will put North Korea at its feet.
Washington doesn't want to agree with that statement before Pyongyang made his move.
Kim, yes, and the President of the United States wants the second peak.
But there is a great scepticism about Pyongyang seriousness that the country is the only means of reassuring its security around him.
When Pompeo's plan is to go to Pyongyang the second peak between Kim and Trump.
In Paris fashion show the new line of massive hats on the way to High Street.
If you want to increase the collection of your hats or you want to completely block the sun, here's your answer.
Valentino and Thom Brown's designers introduced a series of curious hats in the collection of springs in 2019 which quivered in the style displayed in Paris Moda week.
In this summer the hats that are no practical have been brought into the Instame and these designs have led their visible designs to the passage.
Valentino's most remarkable pieces, with a wing like a feather, covered the heads of models.
We have a kind of strange, rather strange hat, and a kind of pine-but not a design to warm themselves.
Thom Brown also showed a collection of strange masks for Hallowe.
Many colored masks have lips full, and Hannibal Lecter's are rather than high tailors.
One seemed to be masked for the divan, with glasses and pipes, while another, watered icecake.
If you're the driver of the mod, you've got good news.
The style experts say hatefully will go out, even to your neighbours.
The high size hats follow 'La Bomba', the straw hat on the two foot, from Rihanna, and the number of famous people dressing up to Emily Rajkowski.
The culture mark behind the hat that has succeeded in social networks has led another object into the passage - the straw bag for the beach, almost as large as the bathing model.
It's been finished with the cinnamon bag and the white leather handle in Jacques' La Riviera 2019 News of the Pigonist Paris Moda.
Luke Armittage cebriti's stylist said at FEMAIL: -I hope I have a big hat and big bag for the beach to reach the main streets next summer, it would be difficult to ignore the great echoes of the giants who had been the designer. -
John Edward: Basic languages for global citizen
The independent schools of Scotland perform academic records, and continue in 2018, independently of the results of the examinations, which have been established in the sports which have been reinforced by the most excellent results of the individual and of the community, still in music and among the other projects of the community.
With 3,000 students at school, these schools, The Scottish Council of Independent Schoools (SCIS) try to give the schools the best service between the students and their parents.
The object of independent schools is to prepare them for high education, to prepare them as their chosen career, and as a citizen.
As an educational sector we can designed and implement a custom cultum in the school, we have seen that modern languages continue the usual choice from the students.
And Nelson Mandela said, \"If you speak in a language that understands anyone, you will come into his head.\"
If you speak in his language, you will arrive in his heart.
It is a powerful way of making associations with the people of other countries, and of making them trust in them, that we do not have to use the English only.
From the results of the last studyes of this year, we may see that the languages are at the top of the majority in independent schools.
The 68 percent of the students who learn foreign languages has acquired the best classification.
The data, collected at the 74 student school of SCIS, shows that the 72 percent of the students got the best classification in the Chinese Mandatory, 72k in German, 69 per cent per cent and 63 in the French.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are doubtless regarded as an indissoluble capacity for young people and children.
Languages, at the present time, work as an axis of teaching (i.e. science, technology, engineering and mathematician) in the quatroculums of independent schools.
In 2014 a committee in the United States found that one of the principal reasons for fulfilling the job was the ignorance of the language.
More and more, the more it becomes necessary to learn language, to prepare the young people for the future carriages.
With more work options required by language, these skills are indispensable in the globalized world.
If they've learned a second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future with the advantages of this whole life.
Being able to speak directly to the people of foreign countries, it will automatically be put to the head of an elective person.
According to the inquest of the EB 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 could not speak any foreign language, as a common interview, and among those who speak only of French only went up to two digits, 15 percent.
That's why it's so important in teaching languages in the present children.
To talk more than one language, which most commonly uses in economic development, will give you more opportunity to discover your children.
In Scotland, they differ according to the language which school teaches.
A number of students prefer more modern languages, and others who seem to be important to EB, like Mandarin or Japanese.
Those are the interests of your child. It will always be the wide language option to learn in independent school with the teachers who are expert in the field.
It is the purpose of the independent schools of Scotland to prepare children to be successful in different tasks in the future, and furnish them with tools.
We can't deny it at this time, in an international business environment, where languages are for the future of the country indispensable, so we need to reflect on education.
For modern languages should be understood as the ability to communicate.
The independent schools will continue their choice, multiplicity, and endurity to the young in Scotland.
I'm the two faut le faire.
John Edward School is the Director of the Independents in the Scotland Council.

President Donald Trump will start up the Rally campaign on Weeling tonight, West Virginia.
Trumpe's next week will be the first of five ralyses, and he will visit many places he has, others Tennessee and Mississippi.
The Republicans are in danger of losing the control of the Congression in November.
What time is Trumpe's mytina today and how is it possible to watch on the Internet?
Trumpe's turning up west Virginia at 7:00 this afternoon, 29 September 2018, Saturday.
You can see the Trump Mitina online in the West Virginia through Youtube tram.
It seems that Trump will correct the hearings of the named Brett Kavanaugh on this week of the Supreme Court until the confirmation of the Senate maintains the suffrage in the state of your sexual position.
But the chief object of this migration is to assist the Republicans in November elections.
So, the Presidente Trump says that the end of these five myths of the next week is to help the rebels in the Senate of the Republicans and the most in the house of the representatives -- according to Reuters.
-The Congression Congress is important, and the president will travel to the most possible states as the campaign goes in? The voice of Trump's campaign, which had not allowed Reuters to give his name to the agency.
Wesbanco Atraden, Weheeling, today's militina Ohio and Pennsylvania, and allows them to cover the communications of Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.

Ryder Cup8: Will attempt to continue on a single Sunday match.
After three sessions on one side, this Ryder Cup needed it.
The moment's key is a concept of sport, in which players believe, but not for competition.
So, where can you tell me the moment is now?
- They had a point of six, and now they have four, so I think the time is now, says Jordan Spiceth, when you're on a day's field.
Of course, Europe has an advantage over four points, from the twelve in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is not on their side, and they need support most of them, especially the Spiceth and Justin Thomas, who played together and got three points from the four.
Spieeth has been quite decisive, from the same to the Green, and is conducting with the pattern.
These yells of celebrating have been louder and louder as they move forward, and the piece is important, winting four all-squares after Thomas lost two after two.
15. He celebrated it with a different cry, like the besieged in the game, which means that the American team is not out of competitive.
- You've got to search for the Germans and take care of your game, Spieth said.
It's what these players have left.
To get 18 holes out of here.
The only player who ever got more than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days is Francesco Molin and Tommy Fletwood, the historical players in Ryder Cup.
The special but charming couples of Europe are four of the four, they have sworn to have failed.
- Morliwood - it was the only couple that didn't throw a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning they also took bogeys and the last nine o'clock on Friday afternoon.
This shift and the crowd of powers had turned into a couple of Sundays, and there was no more European players than Fleetwood and Molinar when the sun is sunning out in Lelf National.
It's better in different holes together.
But it's early to talk about the great Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson speeded up Sergio García's job, the best to four, as Alex Noren was equal to.
They put a Bogey in front of two doubles to victory the Spanish and the Sedians in a hole that was never too near.
But on Sunday, who wasn't helping me get out of your hole.
The four of them were fascinated by sight of each other, who gave counsels, who did not give them counsel, and at a moment saw how to change the strategy.
Europe had behaved better as a team, and had an extraordinary advantage for the finale, but the Fourteenth show that the U.S. team has the courage to fight, some, especially Statside.
Europe got a 10-6 advantage on Ryder Cup's financial advantage.
Europe has produced an extraordinary advantage on the financial advantage of Ryder Cup, after the Saturday quadrupe achieves 10-6 against the United States of America.
Tommy Fletwood and Francesco Molinari had won two great victories against Tiger Woods, and the four valid points from now on at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn, two years ago trying to recover the lost prize in Hazelin, was the main morning, and won three-1 series.
The United States offered a larger resistance, and won two games, but they could not exceed the difference.
On the side of Jim Fury needed eight points to hold the prize on one Sunday.
This is the only European who won four points after Feetwood, and with Molinari, after a magnificent weekend called Mllewood, is secondly four points in the story of Ryder Cup.
When we broke Woods and Patrick Reed, he finished the game very well with the tired Woods and Bryson Dechambea Americancrobea with 5 and 4 light.
Woods, after two games on Saturday had been played, showed them a touch of perfection, but he lost them since the 29 game in fourbals and foursoms, seven followed.
Justin Rose had rested for the fobal morning and Henri came back to win on the four four-and-twenty four-twenty four-year-old Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeka - the best and third world.
Europe did not find her way to the southwest in the fresh, cool day.
Three times the Jordan Spiethes and Justin Thomas set a reference to the Americans on Saturday.
They had won 21 a vague victory at Jon Rahm of the Spanish and Ian Poulter and then the Poulter and Rory McIroy had lost two holes in the four-and-twenty flats.
In the history of Ryder Cup's premises a group has only managed twice to get through four point-point differences, even though Furyk needed only a draw-out to hold the prize.
In two days, after the second best, they'll be ahead of him on Sunday's opposite.
The North Korean has given him a round nod, without trusting to leave their weapons.
The foreign minister of Korea told the United Nations on Saturday, that the punishments of the United States prevented their trust in the United States, and that in such a condition they would not at all leave a nuclear weapon.
Riong Hotz told the whole year of the world's organization that Korak - had been taken for the most significant measures in the world - to leave the nuclear arms and the misilians' tests to make the nuclear tests and the nuclear nuclear techniques and the nuclear weapons.
\"We don't see any good answers from America?\" he said.
- No confidence in our national security, no matter what, we can only leave our first arms?
The family complaints of North Korea with regard to the resistance of Rick Washington repeats that in the case of nuclearization - a process in the North Koresa would have been rewarded for slowly giving steps.
Kim Jong Time and Donald Trump tells the President of the United States and North Korea leader on the 12th of June.' Then Kim promised that he would denounce the peninsula of the Koror, and Trump swore to guarantee the safety of the North Korea.
The North Korea is searching for a way to form an end to the War in Korea, but the United States of America have stated that Pyonggy must leave the first arms.
Washington didn't pay attention to relieve the punishments established in North Korea to the international voices.
-AEB again say that he must leave his first arms, and continue to increase the pressure of punishment, to oblige them to attain their purpose, and - it's against the expression of the war?
- Zigor is a uttopia that we don't know about them.
The problem is, the follow-up penalties increase their deficiency.
Rik hasn't mentioned it at the beginning of the week in the United Nations the second peak between Kim Trumps announced by the United Nations in the United States.
The minister, on the other hand, mentioned three meetings in the last five months between Kim and Moon the leader of Korea and South Jae, and added, \"If the other party were South Korea instead of the United States, the denudation of the Korrea would not be blocked.\"
Nevertheless, the tone of Rien's speech would be quite different in the past where North Korea had declared that they were gazed at the United States in the NB.
This year, before the United Nations, Trump, who declared that he was going to cut North Korea - because he had the courage to take out his arms, but he declared that he was still to do it, and that he would continue with penalized North Korea until he was denuced.
On Wednesday, Trump declared that he hadn't had time to do it, even if it's three years or five months, no matter.
China and Russia believe that the National Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps given.
But the Secretary of the United States, Mike Pompey, declared in front of the NB Security Council, on Thursday, that we must continue to repress the penalties of the Council without failing, until we find that its disappointment is real?
The security council has suspended the penalties which have been inflicted since the North Korea 2006 in Pyongyang as an attempt to lock up the nuclear program and the Balistics.
Pompeus was joined by Ri, and then he announced that Pyongyang would revisit the second peak.
Pompeus has been at North Korea for three times, but the last trip did not go well.
When he came back from Pyongyang in July saying that there was only one thing for North Korea after he had been accused of the petitions that those people do in those hours -
The North Cordelia swore that in a meeting with Moon they would leave the places and nuclear complexity if the United States take a measure of their own:
Kim said to Kim that he was looking for the measures corresponding to him -- Trump said they were the securitys of the Singapore, and he tried to direct it to Washington's normalization.
The students of Harvard have learned to rest properly enough for themselves
This year of Harvard College will make more sleep to subgrade the subgraded grades, to try to face the culture of those who learn to spend the evening's coffee.
A teacher saw in the best schools in the world that students lose their reward in the way they take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, the medical professor of sleep in Harvard's School and the specialist in Brigham and women's hospitals, designed the school that thinks he's the first EB.
When he had given a speech about the effacy of sleep at school time, he began to learn.
\"A girl in my back came up to me and said, 'Why do I have to do this alone now, only the last year of my school?'
No one said how important it was to sleep, which surprised me,\" Telegraph said.
In the course of the year the students are presented to them the influence of schools and sports, and even to improve their welfare.
Paul Barreirka, a psychiatric psychiatric psychiatric premises in Harvard, and the medical service in college, explained that the students had decided to start learning that he was only sleeping during a week.
A long-time study takes several interactive tasks.
In one section, the image of a bedroom is where students can see the effect of the cafe, curtains, coaches, training books, and the effect of the cafe and light that presses books, and that too little in sports performance to see the influence it makes, and the habit of getting it to bed.
In another section, it is shown to sharers that too few sleep should strike their hearts, and that they might increase the danger of depression or can be cancer.
In a map of the Kanputus, an interactive icon, invites the participators to think about their daily customs.
\"We know that we won't change the habits of students at once.
But we believe they have a right to know if you choose to smoke cigarettes, as you have the right to know the consequences that it will be in your health.\"
It still exists -- it is said, the cultural culture to be performed by modern technology and students, and the more pressure increases the problem of the hour.
Good sleep, good-natured sleep, would have to face the stress, fatigue, and nervousness-the secret charm?' He said, \"and even to gain weight, because little sleep puts his brain to starvation, and we'll be hungry all the time.\"
The 19-year-old Raymond So, a chemical biology, has helped Professor Czeisler to design his lesson, and he had one of his first classes at Harvard.
He declared that the student had opened his eyes and that he had pushed him to part in one of his colleges.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask for an inquiry equal to the sliders before they entered an organization.
Professor Czeisler recommends the alarm to go to bed, and even to wake up, and to know the effects of the effective influence of the blue light and the LED lights, which may alter the cyrarchians, and may cause them to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Meng has passed the men of Gerrard
Ringer had another failure in Dolly Meng's Rington at 1-0th Steven Warrd.
They wanted to win at 4-1 St. Johnston first, but Gary Holtte's team made the second failure of the War team as an engineer in 18th, leaving his eight dots without the Hellespondence of the Rocks Champs Champion.
Meng had spent seven minutes before the strike was over, and Rangers' work did not succeed.
The Rangers are now down to the sixth position, while Livingston has gone to the third and are only on the side of Hibernia.
The problem might have been worse for Rangers because Calum Spencer had been treated by an object that had been thrown out of the outside.
Warder made eight changes and got Ayr Betfred to the finals of Corp.
Holt, she went with Livi 11 on her way through the past, and she took a point to Herts, and she would be glad to see how the clothes she had adjusted were drowned by her opponent each time.
Rangers subdued the property, but Livingston made their move more profitous.
Scott Pittmani Pittmani Alan McGregor would have to go in, but the half-bearer didn't take advantage of it.
A deep-shouldered launch at Keagan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halketttt, but his team was only able to get away behind the pole.
Rangers took control, but in the last place, hope seemed to be bigger than belief in their game.
It seemed to Alfredo Morels that he must have been a penitent at the edge of the quarter when he and Stev's Lawles crashed, but Steven Thomson didn't notice the appeals of the Colombian.
Rangers had only to shoot two in the first half, but Liam Kelly had hardly any trouble with Lassna Coullily's head and the light blow of Ovie Ejari.
The first skirt you got in 34 minutes might have hurt the change of the game, but nobody can at least deny the utmost effort they deserved.
Ranggers again did not succeed in fighting a ball at Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, and he decided to make a simple end.
Warder took the hands of Coullibly by changing Ryan Kent, and changed his change to Morelos, but Kelly ran the block off his line.
But Livingston was obliged to play the outside game, after the long walks of Lithgow and Halketttt.
The holt's team had the chance to increase his advantage, but McGregor held his head firmly before he came back from the courtroom.
The replacement of Ranggers, Glenn Midleton, had asked again for a penitentiary with Jacobs, but Thomson did not listen again.
Almanac: Geiger counter guesser
And now - Our Sunday Morning - an Almanac page of the Almanac: September 30, 1882, 1 136 years ago, and DENBORANTRANGE THE physior Johannes Wilhelm - Gaiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting radius and measuring it, which followed this invention came to Geiger's county.
Since that time, Geiger's counting has been the end of science, and the pop culture has become the protagonist of 1950-Bels of Coronado - just like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Cowboys.
Man: - What the hell is that?
Rogers: -Geig is an accounter, it's used to look for radioactive minerals, for example.
When you place these listeners, you can hear the atom effects produced by the radius of the mineral. -
Evans: - Yes, he's listening right now?
- Hens - he died in Geiger '45, that he was missing a few days before he was 63.
But the invention with his name is still alive.
A new cancer circlus bad cell can teach immunity system
A new cancer nucleus can teach bad cells to 'see 'and die to the immunity system
The jolly cell teaches the immunity system to be acquainted with
The method lies in the laboratory of the lucid manufacturing cells from the patient.
Then they can see a common protein and then reconnect.
The test carrier is giving very good results in patients with various kinds of cancer.
To a woman treated with a tinkling celestial system, they succeeded in disappearing more than 18 months in the oval cancer of the oval.
Their method is to see a protein, which is common to many cancers called HER2, and then in the news of the cells.
Bethesda (Maryland) The Institute of the United States Ministry of the United States Jay Berzfsky said, \"Our results show that we have a great future circus.\"
HER2 - it pushes the growth of multitype cancers, including the collapsion, both of them, and the canons, and the goods, Professor Berkofsky explained.
When we take the cells from the patients and get to the Carzinogenes-a similar approach is functional in treating a kind of leukemia.
Kaney came into a dynastic for the West Trump, dressed in a MAG hat, after the SNL occurrence.
It didn't work.
Kaye West was yelled in the studio when he announced President of Donald Trump in the United States and said that he would be a president in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, the Ghost Town, wearing a Make American hat, began to say badly against Democrat, and confirmed his position for Trump.
- Every time I talk to a white person, they say, \"How do you like Trump, he's a racist?\"
Well, if I'd been worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago, he said.
In this Sketch, the sales of Christine Blasey Ford, Bret Kavangh, a witness made in front of the Judging Committee of Sensat Damon.
Even if he hadn't blushed, he raised his insulting speech to social nets by Chris Rock.
It's not clear that Rock was trying to stop a joke on publishing.
Besides, he complained of the public in the presence of the West that he had been wrong about his hat among his wings.
- I've been beaten up among the wings.
They told me, \"Don't get out of that hat.\"
They're attacking me!
And then they say I'm in a place in the sink, he said, according to Washington Examer.
And West said, \"Do you want to see the place that was in the wind?\" And he said, \"I will put my Superman cloak in, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do.\" \"Do you want the world to go on?\"
Try to make love.
At least a couple of times after his words, he seemed to be ashamed of the public and the members of SNL sessions, as Vary told him, and a person in the room said to the magazine, \"The whole story was silent.\"
In order to replace Ariana Grande, a few days before, he had killed his friend Rac Miller.
The Web had surprised many people in the song of I loveit, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West took the protection of Candace Turner who's a conservative group, who published it, - one of the bravest spirits:
But the conversation-shower Karen Hunter had smacked it, because he was just West-he was acting just like he was, and that's wonderful.
- But I don't want to reward a person who does it harmful to the community (by buying his own music or his clothes, or his intervention? -
He's free.
And so did we, he added.

Game of Thrones star Kitington appeared at the toxic mushroom.
Kit Harton Jon Snow is known for the swordwoman's role in the biological series of Games of Thrones HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor is opposed to the stereotype of the hero, expressing that the young boys often feel hard to respect for such papers on the screen.

\"Personally and confidently, I think at this moment,\" he said, \"what have we done badly with masks?
\"What have we been teaching when men are growing up, considering the matter we see now?\"
Kit thinks that TV can also have its responsibility for the toxic malcontent, as far as it is concerned, as it is possible to have a very squalling character.
He went on, 'What's natural and what's teaching?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that the way it makes young men feel that they have to do that?
I think that's one of the important themes in our time.
It's obvious that something went wrong for young men.\"

GIB/Hisesa: China has reported that the upload of 14% has been in new cases
China has been informed that the total number of populations with GIB and Hiesta has been raised in 14%.
There are over 8,000 people in the country, as the health-gatherers have said.
There's more than 4,000 new cases registered only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases are transmitted by sex, which is a change to the past.
Traditionally GIB was quickly spreading through some of the Chinese zones.
But in this way the number of people infected with GIB was almost reduced to zero, as the Chinese guards said in a conference of the province Yunnan.
Nevertheless, the number of people in China who have GIB and Hiesa has got up 100,000 people.
Sexual GIB Transmission is a serious problem in the China LGTB community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in 1997, but the discrimination against the people is very widely expanded.
As for the conservative values in the country, it's calculated in research that they are married to a woman of 70-90 men who have sex with men.
Many transmissions of diseases happen for using bad sexual protections.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to the GIB mediation within the attempt to deal with the matter.
Maxine Waters refused the workingmen's data, and puts up his feet the dangerous noisies and the 'conspirators' and 'conspiracies'.
ord. Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday that a member of his team had published a personal information about the three of the United States' republican senators on the pages of Wikipedia.
Democrat of Los Angeles has expressed assertions - right-right-to-right-handed -- expert and web sites that had driven them.
- A lie, a lie, and more contemptible, - Waters said in a statement made in Twitter.
The information you published was the information of the three American senators of Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and page Hatch, both Utah.
On Tuesday an unknown person, published in Capitol Hill, heard a copy of the injunction against Brett Kavanaugh inappropriate sexual exportation.
The leak came after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
The IP address that identifies the source was associated with the Waters office and published by a member of the Wars' workgroup, as it was reported.
-It's a completely false and completely lieless all-' Waters went on.
-The member of my workgroupship, who have compromised personal information and security from those false allegations of fraud, has no responsibility for the leak of that information.
The allegation without the foundation is completely false and completely false.
Waters' statements were instantly received online by criticism, for instance, from Ari Flescher, the former press writer in the White House.
-That's the disrespect from anger, Freischer wrote.
- That shows that there is no character to be a member of Congress.
When they're accused of something they didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He doesn't need to show challenges.
He doesn't have to question the reasons for the accused.
He must be calm and in a good position.
Friescher's reaction on Waters seemed to wish to compare it with the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been too angry at the arrival of the Thursday.
Omar Navarus, in the half-representative elections of the legislature, declared his opinions in Twitter.
- If the meaning is true, he whistled.
In his statements, Waters said that his office had been observed by the facts that the authorities and the entity of compulsion the law had been held out.
-We assure him that those who have broken the law must know what they are? -and that they must answer before the law to every member of my workshop, and to every action which is harmful and dangerous to all the members of my society? -
Johnny English Strices Agriles Agrikats - a small-powered Rowan Atkinson Parodia
It has now become traditional to seek out the meanings of Brexit in any new movie with a British ray, and that is not applicable in the French parish act of Johnny English.
What kind of junk are we about to show ourselves about our satisfactory self-satisfaction? Can we get a new export option for our nation?
In any case, Johnny English has just published a license for ruining things in a large, large eye, and a bad face, that his name shows above all things, that it is only a large comic production designed for areas designed by the movies which are not English.
Although it is a special desire to obtain Glamour Lamour's flattery, it is a secret agent who has a little resemblance to Clouseu, Mr Bean's ray, and in the case of the 2012 Olympic Olympic games in London with one note of Charios of the boy Charios of Fire.
Even in the mysterious traveller and international man, we have forgotten that Barclaycard's advertising advertising on TV advertising.
If there's a fag or two in this last JE.
I loved how Johnny English approached the Helicopter with a helicopter armor in the Middle Ages and the pilgrim's crosses beat him on the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for the comedy is missing from his mood and his mood is too superfluum, especially when the film marks like 007 and Miss Impossible films -- even now when they get into the comedies.
The Ummore seems more correct to the adults than to me, and to me as absurd adventures to Johnny English are not as clever and intelligent as Bean's light in the silent films of Atkinson.
This is a systematic uninterrupted premises, the Great Britain has a serious problem.
A Ziberhacker in the Great Britain's superstitute, showing the identity of all the British agents who are working, and he's afflicted by the agent who's in the service.
This is too much for a first minister of character pompously followed, who is already losing political fame, Emma Thompson seems almost the best to the character of Teresa May, but the script won't help much.
The counselors of his intelligence inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he must recover someone who is retiring.
And that means that Johnny English is doing the same as he can. Now he's a teacher in an elegant place, but he's giving you the confidential schools about acting as a hidden optimistic, because English offers the spy of Rock.
They lead English back to Whitehall to make an emergency usage, and regroups with the Bouggh that was his first partner. Ben Miller interprets that character again.
He's a married man now, tied to a submarine squad.
So, in the Secretary Service of Your Grace, we're in Batman and Robin's share again, finding Ophelia Bulleta with the beautiful Fameletale of Olga Kuryl.
In the meantime, the sceptical mercenary of the Great Britain has enchanted the Prime Minister. Jason Volta is a smuggler, the author of Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their fascades, dressed as a waiter, they give a French restaurant a fire. They make chaos in the luxury of Volta's yacht, and the English makes a complete anarchy use of the virtual reality when he tries to see what it's like when he tries to get out of Volta's house.
All the stops look at this last sequence, but though pleasant and noisy, there's a lot of TV to children.
That's how it works.
And as it happened with other films in Johnny English, this is my idea: can't Rowan Atkinson give a paper that deserves its talents?
The British Party refused to work on a four day's work, but five days he's getting a plan.
He's studying a radical plan of Jeremy Corbyn, Laborist Laborist, who's seen the British work for a week, but he's got five days ahead of him.
The party seems to want to give the workers what they had previously saved through the revolution of artificial intelligence, to give them a few days' holidays.
The workers would have a three-day weekend, but they'd still have the same salary back home.
The sources have stated that the idea 'provids' enters in the economical agenda of the party, and that the country is trying to stand for the workmen.
Passing to four days of work, the union of the unions has received the support of Congress, as a way the workers are changing.
A scaffold from Laborist Party announced to The Sunday Times, \"Before the end of the year, it is predicted to predict a novel of politics.
\"It's not going to happen from one day to next, but there's a week of four days when the party comes to look at the view of the workman's work, and also with the general industry of the party.\"
The Party Laborist Party would not be the part of a man who protects such an idea, since the Vide's Party defended the four days' work week in the campaign of 2017 general elections.
However, the inspiration has not yet received the protection of the whole Laborist Party.
The voter of the Party Laborist Party said, \"Four days of work isn't the policy of the Party, and the party doesn't take it.\"
The Minister John McDonnelll used the part of the Laborists last week to determine the view of a social revolution of economics.
Mr. McDonnel said, no doubt, that \"to the conductors\" and \"speculators\" were to be taken away from public services in the preset.
In the plans of the minister of the drop-off minister, the current celebrities in the water-preset may not receive their entire share, because a laborious government may have done the wrong behavior.
In addition, he confirmed that the workers were plans to enter the seducated managers and to create Funs of the Inklusibly Inventors, which cost 10% of the workers of the private sector.
Lindsey Gram and John Kennedy call it - 60 Mintes - whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their opinion.
As for Judge Brett Kavanagh, the investigation of the FBI has at least postponed his denomination for the Supreme Court, and he has doubted whether the consequences of the investigation might take away his protection from the Republicans.
In a conversation sent on Sunday, - - Sixtt Pelley, the Correspondent of 60 Mintes - asked about the Republician Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Grady and Lindsey, if FBI could change their opinion.
Kennedy appeared more open than his partner in South Carolina.
\"Of course I did,\" said Kennedy.
-I said going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, made him known, I said, \"Did you do that?\"
He replied with emphasis, clearly.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be written on the stone.
-I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh and he'd be able to bear the accusation he would produce, he said.
-Mr. Fordor, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denied it firmly, he added - Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
- And everyone who speaks about him could not verify that.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see that anything new has changed?

But what success has Global Citname's success when he's 12?
Is it a original idea to ask people to do an action, or is it simply another case of what they call it? That is, to make people feel that they are making a real change by signing a online request or sending a joke?

Besides, the team has said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom, that the government would enhance the enlightenment of the mothers and children, it was announced that the Government of Power of Nutification would endanger the project.
In answer to the FAQ questioned at the website, what makes you think we can make you think that we can remove the final poverty?
Global Citname answered: - It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements against our earlier civil rights and apartheid, we shall also succeed, both stronger together.

US Ambassador has accused China with propaganda ?
An officer of China, having established an advocate of four sheets of commerce between America and China, accused Beijing the American press of opening his own propaganda.
The President of Donald Trump, the Chinese newspapers in Moines Register, the second diary selling most selling in the State of Iowa, had mentioned on Wednesday, after having tried to put him into the elections of the 6th US Congression. China denied the smell.
The accused Trump has marked the Reuters as he tried to break into the U.S.A.'s officers were making a new campaign in Washington to make China a pressure.
If it be natural that foreign governments place advertisement for commerce, they are locked up at this moment in a commerce war which is rising up, and each country puts a skeleton to the importations of the others.
The retrooperations of China, at the beginning of the commerce war, were given protection to the Republic of Trump as Iowa to attack the exportations of the States, as China and the United States have stated.
Terry Branstad, the American ambassadors in China, and the governors of Iowa for a long time, that is to say, of one of those who export most of the sales for the peasants to China.
Branstad has stated in an article of Sunday's De Moines Register, -China is attacking the propaganda by making the propastades in our free press?
-He says he's using the strong traditions for free press of America and for the press records in the China government by placing the advertisements in the De Moines Register-Branstad.
-From the agency, here in the press-table in Beijing Street, there is but a little dialectical voice, and there is no real reflection of the different opinions of the Chinese Americans in China, which the media is subject to the firm control of the Communist Party of China.
He added - One of the most popular papers in the Cushina had avoided the offer to publish his article - but he didn't say what the newspaper was.
The Republicans leave women's voters in the middle of legal elections with Kavanagh's debactators, the analysts have remarked.
As many of the republican republicans wait and defend the candidate for Brett Kavanugh to the Supreme Court in front of the several allegations of sex, the analysts have remarked, especially among women, that in the next half-wife elections of the law.
The emotions about this matter have been extremely large, and most of the republicans have been registered to show that they want to go on with the bomb.
It can't be delayed in these matters,' he said to Mr. Maxwell of the University of Granter Syracyse, as the professor of the University of St.
Reher said he has doubts whether the senator would have enough pressure for a FBI investigation to calm his voters.
-Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and not even in November,' Karine Jean-Pierre said, and the national votes of the MoveOni team, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning?' The protestors protested in the presence of the Senate protested that the Republicans who control the Judicature Committee decided to go on with the nomination of Kavanaugh, although the testimony of Dr.
-The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democratics will be excluded, said Stu Rothenberg, the independent political analyst of the news.
- People say they have had a great influence, that's true.
But it may have been more influenced, especially among women and young men with no fixed votes, between 18 and 29 years of age, if they don't often like the president?
Even before the public testimony was made against the candidate of the Court of the Supreme Court, the Republicans had suggested that he would be aggressive if the Republicans were determined to continue with confirmation.
-It has become a great deal for the Republican Party? Michael Steple said, the former president of the Republican Committee, according to the week he left in NBC News.
-It's not about the union vote, whether the last vote or Kavanaugh has to sit down on the chair of the accused, how the Republicans manage this matter, and treat the woman?
However, the Americans seem to be rather divided by the time they believe in Ford and Kavanaugh, but they seem to be doing a little more for the second.
As a new ink of YouGov shows that 41st of those who have contributed to believe in Ford's evidence, and that 35% of security or sure of Kavanagh.
In addition, Kavanaugh said %38 was probably lying in his statement, and 30% said the same thing about Ford.

He declared under oath that Ford, when he had been drunk by Kavanaugh, he had declared that he was drunk for 17 years.
Ramirez's candidates from the Supreme Court announced that they were at a party at Yale when they were students in 1980.
The one who invented Wide Web, plans to start a new Internet with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, who invented Word Wide, wants to start a startup with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the legend of Technology, Inrupt, is a company based on the Free Software platform of Berners Lee.
Solid allows users to choose which of their data will be stored and how people will have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Le was making fun of the intention behind Inrupt - to take the world to depend on being.
-We need to do it now, he said, about the startup.
- It's an historical moment.
App uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal data store - or a POD.
Contacts list, to-dos, may contain lists, calendar, music store, and other personal tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify: they are all available in a single browser and all together.
This is a separate case for the online personal data storage that is fully accessible to the user's hand. Information on a specific type that can be accessed by the user.
- It's called the company that can handle people by the cats.
According to the Executive director John Bruce, this is the idea behind Inrupt: the means, the processes, and the right ability to make it useful for all of us.
Now are those who form a company: Berners-Le, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a set of developers and a community of volunteers.
From this week on, the world's techniques could create their decadent apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said they're not talking about her and her team?
- We're not asking them for permission?
On a post that is published on the Sabbath, Berners-Lee wrote the Inrupt zenity of a new network built in Solid to protect the integrity and quality of the new network --
In 19994, Berners-Lee had completely changed when he created the Internet World Web Consortment at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Le was a voice of great influence on neutrality of the network.
Even during the Start of Startup Institute, Berners-Le, Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Date Institute will continue to be creator and director.
-I'm a very optimisticist about the next time of the Internet?
Bernard Vann, the First World Victoria They say he's been Corporated.
They say that as the first World War warrior, Victoria's only chalk in England who has received the Cross, in his own country, 100 years later.
Lieutenant Lukáš won his prize on the 29th of September 1918, at Bellenglise and Lehacourt.
However, a Frank had killed four days later, and he never knew that he had received the supreme British reward of military honor.
A memorial stone displayed by his grandson on the Rushden of the Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of the vilobes, Michael Vann said, 'It was a very symbolic stone to give his grandfather a reward and a hundred later display.'
According to the London Gazette, on the 29th of September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Channel - that he was very closed, and that under the constant fire of cannons and machine guns?
Then he ran quickly to the first line of fire, and, with the greatest courage, led the line forward until he found a cannon alone and threw it on the third floor of detachment.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German Frankiator on the 4th of October 1918 before the war was over.
Michael Vann, the 72-year-old, said he knew he could never do his grandfather's actions-but this gives a lot of humility?
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a flower croak after the defile.
Michael Vann said, \"It was a great honor to them to share in the file-and added: 'A hero of theirs proves that the protection of many people will be given to him?'
MMA's fans waited for the night to see Bellato 206, but Peppa Pig instead of it.
Suppose you wake up all night to see Bellato 206 people, and then don't let you see the main session.
The postcards of San Jose fought 13 in the sixth calendar, and it was to be right at night in the United Kingdom on the 5th Channel chain of the Channel.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight against each other, the inspectors of the United Kingdom were surprised and surprised when he changed to Peppa Pig.
Some didn't surprise them until little hours of the morning when they were awake to fight with him.
A follower -- described it as a bad joke - the change for Twitter's living drawings?
-A law of the government says that this was not proper for 6:00 in the morning, and had to change to the program for the kids? Dave Schwartz, the managers of Bellator and Communication asked him about the show.
-Peappa pig, - Yes?
President Scott Coker of Bellat Coker in the Bellato Avenue said they're going to examine the programming in the future for the American inspectors of the United Kingdom.
-I think when I think about repeating it, I think it's likely we can fix it!' said Coker.
- But it's six o'clock in the Sunday morning, and we can't fix that until our hour is Sunday, Monday at their hour.
But we're working on the work to fix it.
Believe me, when it changed, there were a lot of messages going forward and back, and all of them were not very pleasant.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government matter.
I promise the next time it won't happen again.
We're going to put five fights instead of six, as we usually do, so we tried to offer more people, and we missed them.
It's a situation that's going to happen unhappily?
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'expected'
Tom Daley says that the Olympian banquet had grown up under the rest of his sex, but this gave him the motivation of success.
The 24-year-old boy said that he didn't realize it was until he went to the second school school-that they weren't all like him?
The first Desert Island Discs in the 4th Radio Laverne, speaking of the first Desert Island, said to the others: \"Courage-to give them the rights of homosexuals.\"
Besides, he said parenting had brought the Olympian game less to win.
The common predictor of the program, Kirsty Young, has been taking some vacations for the disease.
After the first show in Laverne's program, Daley said in the face of all the others:
And he said, \"To this day, until the feelings which have been despised and different from others, have been true reasons for success and strengthening me?\"
He was-something-he tried to prove that, when they heard about him, he didn't want to disrespect the people when they heard of his sex.
The sporting sports won the bronze two bronze medals is converted into a profile of a profiled LGTB and part of the Commonwealth Games which were in Australia, and the more countries were used to degenerate homosexuality.
He said that he had given his opinion that he had the great luck he could live openly without being able to live, and to others - because he wanted to do it.
Three times in the world champion of the world, she said, \"Dustince Black the American filmmaker, whom she had known in 2013-that she had caught him by surprise!\"
She married to the winner of 20 years older than Daley, but she said the difference has not been a problem between them.
He said, \"When you're young and you've been through so many things that you've been through... - when he was 14, he died for the first time and he died with the cancer that three years later he's been hard to find someone like him.
The pair became the parent of a son named Robert Ray Black-Dack-Dacky, and Daley said his whole manner has changed -
-If you had asked me last year, the only thing I had in my head, he said.
And, you know, there are more important things than gold medals in the Olympic games.
My gold medal is Robbie?
His son has the same name as Robert's father when he died in 2011, after he'd been diagnosed with cancer in his head.
Daley said he didn't accept his father to die, and he asked for one of the last things: if he knew about the games in London in 2012, he wanted to be on the first line.
- I couldn't tell him - you won't be in the first row, Father?
-I was holding my hand when he stopped breathing, and I stopped breathing and didn't accept it until he died? - He said he wasn't invincible.
The next day Daley took part in the 2012s of the Olympic games and won the bronze medal.
-I knew it was what I dreamed of all my life-in the Olympic game to place it in front of the public, there was no better feeling, he said.
He also inspired his first song choice, which made him feel the whole process of preparing for the Olympic game, and still clinginging to the helves.

As Mickelson was not in shape, he sat on the bench on the Saturday at Ryder Cup.
The American Phil Mickelson will burn when he plays the 47th Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he'll have to improve his form to make it look bad.
Mickelson's mark was breaking up at once for the last two years, and yet Captain Jim Fury sent him to the seat in the fashionable fourbals and fouromies on the Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as it has often been for the United States, all the world was five times the principal champion had broken the day from one side to another, and the other to play the game in the field with the hope of directing what it suffers.
It was never the directest of the drivers, nor even the best moment in his career, and a four8-year-old player isn't the best opportunity for the race of Golf National, because the toughest players take him out.
And even if the field itself doesn't fear, Mickelson, on the nineth game, on Sunday, has to face the Moliner of Francesco Open Champion, the four games of this week's game, Tommy Feetwood.
If the Americans, at the beginning of 12 games individual under four, have a good beginning, it may be a very decided game of Mickelson.
Fury had trusted his man because he couldn't say much more.
-He understood very well the paper he had today, gave me a little knock on the back, and he told me tomorrow he would be ready, said Fury.
- He has great confidence in himself.
The point of the punta is the sporting sporter and he's been awfully giving these groups in the past and this week.
I probably didn't see two games playing.
I expected more, but that's how it happened, and we felt that we ought to behave like that.
He wants to be there, like everyone else?
Mickelson will overcome the burner of Nick Faldo as a player in Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may end the professional course of Ryder Cup which has not reached his individual mark again.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost 18 times, and stayed seven times in between.
He laughs, and he's a sarcastic and thoughtful person. He's a joke with people, and he's a great person to have his presence, he says.
- Little people have enjoyed playing against him this week, and it was fun to see him.
He does a lot more than he played?
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage of the company of Europe may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, has experience of having a great advantage in the turn of one last day, that Ryder Cup may become an easy situation.
In 19997, the Debulata who had been in Valderrama, had the advantage of the five dots under Seve Ballesteros against the Americans, but they were closely beaten with the 141st competition and the score of 131 and 1322.
- I always remind myself that we had a great advantage in Valderraman and scarcely won, and that we lost him in Brooklin, though it was a great advantage, - Bjorn said (Picken) after the 5 and 3rd class of 2018 on Friday, and that yesterday we earned 10 and 6 A.M.N.
So history tells us that all the members of the company have not yet ended.
We're going to have a lot of cherry talk tomorrow.
We'll go out into the field and try to do everything right.
Nothing is settled until the point has been on the clipboard.
We win the treason, and we'll put our attention on that.
As I've always said, I'm paying attention to 12 players for us, but we know what's the opposite, the best players in the world.
Bjorne said, \"I never want to anticipate anything.
Tomorrow.
It's tomorrow of the individuals, and that's something else.
It's strange to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you're alone, each golf player has to prove its full capacity.
This is the message to which you have been transmitted to the players: the best thing you have taken tomorrow.
Now, forget about your partners, because they also have to get their best out of them?
As Bjorne did not think that Jim Fury in the other group is going to act better than his own players, except Jordan Spiceth and Justin Thomas, who got three points from four.
Fury has been formed by the two changes in the course of the last day, as members of the Brookline winner, and later on, when the Europeans did the miracle of Medina. -
- I remember all the words he said - he said, when we asked Ben Crenshaw about the last day we asked how he would relieve the players of the 1999.
- We have 12 important games to-morrow, but we want to keep the advantage from the beginning, like Brooklin's and the Medicn.
There's a lot of advantage on the other side, there's a lot of pressure on these intermediate games.
We decided on that list of players, and we think we're going to do a great job tomorrow.
Thomas has a contract, and he's gonna have Rory McIroy in the last game, Paul Casty, Justin Rose, Johm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the middle order.
-I have chosen this group in this order because they are able to do the whole way, Bjorne said to the selected individuals.
They've retarded the building of the New German warship
The new German Margara had to be asked in 2014 for the old warship of the Homicide, but at least it will not be built until the next year, as the means of trading systems are more and more costly.
-Rheinland-Palz - The warship (Buertomberg) has been delayed until the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit has been mentioned by the Die.
The ship was to be joined in 2014, but the number of retributors have been forbidden to complete this project.
Marina in 2007 will replace the four ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class of the Bremen class.
It seems as if a powerful cannon, an anti-school signes and secret actions (for instance, restricted radar, and an infrared signature) of the air-custics and ships.
Besides, there will also be longer main main main main main main maintenance, the newfragatas can be out of their original ports for two years.
But because they are constant delays, these warships with the next technology (which are aiming to project their power) will be obnoxious to the service, says Die Zeit.
F125 fraternagata has finished badly in your conferences, because the German army officially rejected the request of the ship, and returned to the Blohm Blohm and Volsola in Hanburg.
It was the first time that the mariner returned a ship to the ship after he had delivered it.
The reasons for returning are not known, but the German communications quoted the serious defects of the soofware and hardware, so that the warboat might be in use for the struggles.
They were specially important software, the Baden-Wuertomberg vessels are operating on half-past 120 sailors, that is to say, at Bremen's class parties.
In addition, the ship has too much weight, and consequently it reduces its performance much, and it is harder to add news to the future.
7,000 tonne-Rheinland-Palz - the ship weighs the double ships of the kind used in Germany in the Second World War.
In addition to the wrong hardware, the price of the whole project (including the training) is also the problem.
3.50 million has reached $3.50, from 2200 dollars that would have to cost at first.
The problem of new evidences is even more important in front of the warnings they claim to reduce the power of the German marin.
A few months ago, Hans-Peter Bartels confessed that the available boats are being exhausted.
The Representative has said that the question has increased more and more because the old vessels have not been substituted after retreating.
He regretted not even a flaming party in Baden-Wuertemberg.
The Naalst Society has observed the secret life of the mouse
A new investigation has been made in a part of the country on Scotland, to find out how the bats are using them for food.
There are some more information about the behavior of these special mammals, in the future, to determine better about supporting them.
The scientists of the Scottish National Trust (NTSS) will continue to follow the common nano and soprano; and also the battering ear and the battering of the Daubenton, Wester Rosse.
There will be special recordings in the essential positions, and the bats will be tracking the activities that will go through the season.
In the United Kingdom System (NHS) workers will also make cellulators with manual detectors.
When the experts make a sound noise for all the writers, the rate of mouse calls will be known, even what each species does.
Then they will be map and report of the habitat, to get a detailed landscape of the mouse's behavior.
In the opinion of Rob Deware, who is the adviser of the natural protection of NTS, the most important areas of the bats will be determined, as well as how each species is employed.
By this information, the advantages of treating the habits are defined; for example, the production of the grasses, and for the bats, and for the species related to them, the best of how to keep the forests.
The squadron mouse-population of the whole United Kingdom or of the United Kingdom showed itself at the bottom of the century.
They are under threats of construction and development, which affect the habits and loses their habita.
Even the wind-turbine and the lightning brings danger, the paper to catch flys, the chemical treatments of buildings, and the attacks of domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind.
Yet, as they hunt at night, they are more useful to their ears than their eyes, at the moment of preying their prey.
They use a sophisticated coal ring on echoes to create bugs and obstructions on the flight road.
The NTS organisation is the economic 270th building, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 in Scotland, and takes the bats seriously.
He has heard ten of them, who regularly observe the observations, the examinations of the havies, and sometimes the rescue.
For the organization has created the first and only bat-servation in Scotland on the land of Dumfries and Galloway, eight of the bats of Scotland.
As David Thompson says that the land is manager over the land, the land is excellent for them.
- We have a good dream for Threav's bats?
- We have old raisins, and many years' trees; it's very convenient.
Still, there are still many things about the bats, so we shall understand what they require in order to be healthy.
Thompson has stated that it is very important to check if there is any bats before you do the jobs in the barracks; for if you do nothing at all, you can kill 400 bats and puppies, and perhaps the whole population of the place might disappear.
The mouse is protected by species, and it is illegal to kill them, to pursue or disturb them, even to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Frerrell, representative of the organization of the Saguzar.
He said, \"We must still learn a lot of things about bats, and we don't know how many species live with us.\"
Ronadaldo has rejected the attacks while his lawyers are in a hurry to sell the German journal.
The violation of rapping against him - he said that they are false, Cristian Ronaldo, and that those who have made it use of it by his name - that they only want to have a publicity.
They're preparing to report the German Der Spiegel who published his lawyer.
The prefect of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping Las Vegas in 2009 by a American woman named Kathryn Mayorga.
After that, he thought he paid $375,000 for a secret event, as Der Spiegel declared on Friday.
Acoustication has been fired and made a direct video of Instame for 142 million followers in the platform that the accused has said they are false.
- No, no, no, no.
What I said today is false news, - he said in front of the camera the Golden Bale has won five times.
- They're trying to get my name on cucumber.
It's normal.
They want my name to be famous, but that's what happens in my profession.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine, - the player said, smiling.
The lawyers of Ronaldo are preparing Der Spiegel to sell the defendants, which are the unacceptable public public publications that make the publications stand for.
Christian Schertz has been told that the player will ask for damage-as far as the nerve of the dog is concerned, which is one of the most serious breaks of personal rights.
It was supposed to be in June 2009 in a hotel and casino suit in Las Vegas.
After meeting them in a nightclub they thought they were going to the Ronald and Mayorga player's room.
Mayorga stated that Ronald had fallen on his knees after the fact that he thought he was a good man in the 99th, but - in a hundred days he failed. -
The documents say that the couple had sex-things, Ronaldo, but that his relationship was authorized.
Mayorga also said he had gone to the police, and had photographed his wounds in the hospital, but later he came out of the court to an outside agreement, - because surprises were terrible - and - because he was concerned about being humiliated.
She said 34 years ago, she wants to retrace the agreement because she's still traumatized.
At the time when an unexpected attack occurred, Manchester was on his way from the United States to the Red Madrid, and he went to the great group of Juves in Italy on the way to a hundred million dollars.
Brexit: The United Kingdom - Will regret losing auto-feature
He'll regret the United Kingdom - just to leave the auto-families headquarters - after Brexit - because Greg Clark said the business records.
He also said - That Toyota UK company told BBC that the United Kingdom without agreement from the European Union will stop the production of the factory in Burnaston (Derby).
- We need an arrangement, Clark said.
The Japanese automobile, as it said, may cause delays to be lost by retards on the customs without agreement.
The factory in Burnasto (the one who manufactures the Auris and Avens) was nearly 50,000 cars every year, and 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
- If the United Kingdom exits without agreement from the United States of the March Union, the production of our factory will be stopped, said Marvin Cook Burnatese Toyota in Toyoto.
Some other self-factors in the United Kingdom (like Hundred, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover) have been also declared to fear that if they come out of the European Union there should be no agreement between the frontiers.
BMW said to close his Mini factory for a month.
The main concern of automobiles are risks about the supply chain, - Brexit - if you do without a deal.
The production line of Toyota is current - and the pieces arrive at 37 minutes, either in the United Kingdom, or from the European Union providers, as they requested.
If the United Kingdom leaves the 29th of the March Union without agreement, then the absence of delays and fictions may occur at the limits of the March Union.
It wouldn't be possible to keep the Toyota more than one day in the Derbyshire factory, so the production should be stopped.
In Clark, for future relations in the European Union, Theresa Mayor is a plan because it's measured to avoid these tests in the customs?
We want the best deal to be an agreement, not just to make sure the current success, but also to use this opportunity in the future - he said in the Todaday program of 4 BBC Radio.
-And besides Toyota, other manufacturers have shown that it is necessary to follow the supply chains that are very successful. -
Toyota couldn't tell how long the production would be stopped, but for the long period, the difficulty of the manufacturer would be reduced to a competitive competitor, so he remarked that the jobs would be lost.
Peter Tsuvallas, the manufacturer of the union United United United United States, said that the members are more and more preoccupied, - I hope we will not recover these jobs if we lose them.
A government vote has said: - We have presented a definite and trusted plan for future relations with the Union. -
Maybe retard a meeting between Trump and Rosenstein on the White House
The important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein... could be postponed for a week... while Brettt Kavanaught is on its way forward for the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Robert Muller overlooks the work of special counselor Rosenstein. In the United States elections, the connection between Trum's assistants and Russia is being conducted by the president's belief that Mullerer is investigating the justice of the United States.
Trumps fired the general prosecutor and consequently put Mullee's independence in the last few months of Washington.
On this month New York Times has been informed that Rosenstein had considered the conversation with Trumps to take a secret microphone, and to remove the president from the post of the United States by 25th Constitution.
Rosenstein cancelled the information.
However, on Monday he went to the White House, while the information they told him he was going to break out.
Instead, he declared that he would have a meeting with Trump on Thursday at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he'd rather not release Rosenstein, but then the meeting has been delayed not to conflict with the judiciary power of the Senate, in this committee, Kavanaugh, and one of the women who accused him of making sex, Dr. Christine Blased, testified.
In Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the accusations against Kavanagh, so that the vote of the Senate has been delayed even more.
Sarah Sanders Fox News that is Trum's press secretary appeared on Sunday.
When they asked him about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, \"There is no date yet; it may be this week, but I should understand to postpone another week when everything is happening in the court of court.\"
Still, we'll see, I always like to keep the press known.
Some reporters won't agree with that expression, because Sanders didn't give him the 19th of September's press press of the White House.
Chris Wallace asked the reason why.
In Sanders, it wasn't lacking the press press press press records - it's supposed to be frightening - but he said - I know it's really great.
Then he suggested that the right relationship between Trump and the press will grow up.
- The president works a lot more questions than his predecessors, he said - and he added, without telling us about the proofs, - We have tried these statistics. -
Sanders said they're going to keep the presses, but if the court can ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than to ask me.
We often try to do this, and you have often seen that we've done it in the last few weeks, and that will replace the press, when we can speak to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from the White House when it comes out of the White House, when it comes to partakes of open sessions, or in the press conferences where diplomats visit when they visit.
She doesn't usually do her own press conference.
The president of the United States has shown the possible reason for it in New York this week when he made an enamel appearance in front of the reporters he had collected, and sometimes strange.
The city secretary in the Army Department has written a letter to the European Union employees who work in Scotland NHS system because of the concerns of Brexit -
He has written to the workers of the European Union who work in the Scotland State, to thank for the whole country, and - Brexit - to stay there after the Scotland.
The United Kingdom has written that the letter is less than six months to leave the European Union, the Parliamentaries of Jeanne Freeman Scotland.
The State of Scotland has already agreed to take over the cost of the cost of the European State of the Union working in public services.
This is what Freeman said in his letter: - Through the Urdal, the negotiations of Brexit-Brexit - have advanced between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and we hope to make a decision for autumn.
Nevertheless, the government of the United Kingdom increased the preparations for an uncommon exit.
I know it's a very worried time for everyone.
That is why I want to confirm every worker's contribution, even his nationality.
The fellowships of the European union, and outwards, bring useful experience and capacities, and improve the task of health in the favor of the community which we serve and serve.
Your house is Scotland, no doubt, and we hope to stay with us.
Christion Abercrombie has been optimistic after he has suffered a wound in his head.
Christian Abercrombie Tennessee Theater of Tigers has been opulently opulent after having suffered a wound on his head on Saturday after 31 and 27 lost in Vandert Commores, because Mike of Tennese.
Rod Reed Tennessee's chief coach, a bit earlier than the rest of the game's rested on the head wound.
- He's gone down to the lobby and lost the hurricane, Reed said.
The ex-pugs and personal mediates have given the oxygen to Abercrombie, and have taken him to a oligarchy to make a deeper examination.
A representative of the Tennessee State State Representative (Tennessee) said Chris Chris from the operation in the WSMV and was on the media center of Vanderbil.
Harris said - No detail of the wound or its anguish has been given - and they are trying to determine when the wound was wound in the Tennessee State.
He's in his second year with red-hot Abercrombie, and he's having his first time when he's transferred from the Illinois of Tennessee State.
He made five loaves before he left the game on Saturday, and made all of it 18 badges all the time.
The foreign Buyers will have to pay more taxes above the ring when they buy goods in the United Kingdom
A foreign buyer is to pay more taxes above the ring when they buy goods in the United Kingdom, and he will be used to help those who have no house, according to the plans of the maintainer.
This strategy is the purpose of neutralizing the young suffrage that Corbyn had to attract the voters.
The kingdom will be to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom to raise the taxes above the ring
If they think of the public treasure, they'll collect more 120 million million dollars a year, so they'll help people with no homes.
A foreign buyer is to pay more taxes on the turbree when they buy goods in the United Kingdom, and he will be used to help those who have no house, as Theresa May said today.
This strategy is the purpose of neutralizing the young suffrages Corbyn, which Corbyn has succeeded, and has promised to pay more taxes to those who have the sum of right prices, and to pay more taxes to those who have most income.
In the United Kingdom, it will be for the persons and empresss which pay taxes not for taxes, and for the efforts of reducing the persons in which the government sleeps in the street will be used to reduce them.
Overload, which is added to the taxes above the current ring (including the upper taxes for the second houses in which two years were entered and bought for the benefit of the advertising), may be a per cent until three percent is completed.
If they think of the Public treasure, they'll collect more 120 million dollars a year.
It is calculated that those who do not live in the United Kingdom 13 are bought, and that the prices are raised, and it is harder to get into the property for those who want to buy it for the first time.
The rich lands of the city, especially the capital, have become the neighbours -- for the foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the city.
To help the young people buy their first apartment, Boris Johnson has made a claim to restrict the taxes on the tint.
Leave the soil buying, and leaving the prices of goods at large, and asked May to let the house of reasonably well-depthed housing pay away, the Big Britain - the Britain of Britain.
Corbyn, on the other hand, has introduced some attractive reforms around the housing, others on control of the rents and - unreasonable homeless -
In addition, he wants to provide more townal powers to build more housing.
May said, \"I said I would declare my Presidente to be the first of the British dream to improve the life of each new generation.\"
It means you're going to fix the housing plan.
Big Britain doors are always open to them, working and trying to organise their lives.
Nevertheless, to men who do not live in the United Kingdom and are as easy for foreigners as to be bought by the British population, which is not just as easy for the British population, as it is to be bought.
For too many people, the dream of having a housing has been too far away, and the worthyness of those who have to sleep in the street is still here.
Jack Ross: - It's my greatest desire to train in the Scotland Team -
The head of Jack Ross Sunderland has his greatest career - to be an trainer of Scotland.
The Scotch Scotch Scotch of 42 is enjoying the recompense of the northern club in the third place of Legue One, three points from the first position.
This summer he came to the stadium of Stadium's Light, when the St. Mire Group returned to Scotland Premiership.
- I wanted to act as a player for my country.
I won a leag trophy, and that was all, - Ross said in the BB Scotland Sport.
- But I saw the Scotland Games with my father in Hampden, and I've always had the desire to come back.
Still, I would only have had the opportunity to handle the club.
Amongst the Sunderland coach, Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Samlarice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kanee, Gus Poyet and Paul Canio.
The former of Alloa Athletics has said that he had not felt so nervous as to follow them; for Barnsley and Ipswyn had refused to offer the band to train them.
\"I must ask myself: 'May I bring the club back to Premier Legue?'
As the structure and installation of the club must be in Premier Lege, no doubt he said -
- It won't be easy to get here, but I won't see myself as a successful man if I don't do that.
I've only been working for three years as an coachman in Dumbarton's assistant, and after one of Herts' training workers for 15 months.
Then he helped Allora get him back to the third grade, and thanks to him, he'd been a champion the next time he came down from St. Mir.
Ross says he's feeling more comfortable now than when Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkir, Strerr and Hamilton was in the Academical groups.
He said, \"It was my time to cross the road for me, maybe.\"
- I really thought it was the best function for me to be an coachman than to be a gambler.
It's strange to say that, for I was a good gambler, I did well to make life, and I lived in a number of important fames.
But it could be hard to play.
You have to bear a lot of things every week.
I still have to bear the stress and pressure of the job, but I'm happy to be an coachman.
I've always wanted to be an coach, and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable in my skin than ever.
All conversations will be given in September 30th, while on Radio Scotland radio Sound Session 12:00 and 13:00 (BST)
Five-thirty on Saturday is the best time for a drink, according to an inquest.
Thanks to the summer heatballs, a lot of money in Britain got up, but the pressure increases for the restaurant chains.
Pub and bar chain sales are 2.7 percent, but the restaurant's got down at 4.8 percent, as the data says.
Peter Martin says he works in the CGA company-heavers who collects data as Peter Martin says, 'Because the vegetables have been constantly playing, and the group of England has remained more than thought in the World football box, where the harvest data is equal to the equanimal data, where the public entries have been 28 percent, but we can still lower the restaurants.
Even if the restaurant sales were down at 1.8, they'd been even worse in July.
The public and tavern that specialize in drinks have been much better surrendered, and it has been more than the reservation of restaurant sales.
Even the pubs that specialize in the food have suffered under the sun, but not as many as the restaurants.
Apparently people just want a drink.
The pub and tavern's drink sales have gone up 6.6 last month, and the food's for the last few more than 3 percent down.
Paul Newman, who is a responsibilities in RSM company, has said, \"The result is continued from the end of the April.\"

An advertising for a milk-responsive cross-referenced opinion on the Internet
One of the milk-travellers' company has created opposed opinions on the internet, compared to cows with the jets.
- It's a silent promising exhibition for the first milk in the world - to make a presentation of what's said, Elvie's technicians' technology has triggered an inspiring advertisement for music video, to show the freedom that gives new devices to the mothers who make milk.
They dance in a jar full of four women full of straw, with a song that has these words and a song like:
That's stupid. - I'm getting some milk, I'm getting some milk, I'm getting milk, I'm getting milk, I'm getting milk. -
However, this advertisement published by the company on the Facebook page has been discussed on the Internet.
77,000 notices and hundreds of comments, the video has produced various reactions in the audience. Many have said that milk-surrogate doesn't take it seriously.
- It was a bad decision to use cows for publicity of this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and divided into milk, but they steal their young to a few days after their birth, - a user has said.
Elvie is discrete in one of the breasts of milk (Elvie/Mother)
Somebody said, \"Very traumatic, of course, for mom and baby.\"
But why don't they use them so they don't take away their children to make a publicity for a mother-in-law?
\"No one else has added this:
But some of the others defended the advertisement.
- I think it's a great idea.
If I still give my breast, I'd buy one.
I felt like a cow when I went out to milk.
He's a little crazy, but that's what his purpose is.
- A user wrote it.
\"It's a laugh,\" said another, \"they have to do it in the marketplaces or in the bathroom, because they feel like they are.\"
He has no intention of praise or judgeing milk.
At the end of the video, ladies show that they have been dancing on the chest of milk.
Many women who milk themselves feel as if they were cows in the campaign.
Elvie is extremely quiet, and has no cable or tattoo. She can be moved carefully on one of her breasts, moving as she pleases, so that little children can be in arms or in the street.
Anaarin Mother's partner and executive director reporter commented: -Elvie is a revolutionary product, so he asked for a bold and provocative presentation.
We wanted to show the process and all its challenges between the women and the milk-wives, and to express the freedom of milk in a manner entertaining and closely entertaining.
It's not the first time Elvie attracts attention to the milk shop.
At the Moda school of London, Marta Jakubowski for the product came in with two children.
Hundreds of children were taken in the quiet, silent camp at the border of Texas.
The number of Emigrate children in the backstage have grown very much at last, though they have been the same guards of the frontier every month; it is one of the reasons, that Trump's reformation and hard guides have been more difficult to take children to protect them.
Until now, the unwritten immigrate ones have been most protectors, but now they are afraid to protect their children, because they lose the power of stopping in the United States.
The danger grew in June; for the federal authority said that the other adults who lived in their house should send fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with the immigrate authorities of immigration.
During the week, one of the officers of the United States and customary immigrations of the U.S.A., Matthew Albenc confessed to protect the minors who had arrived unaware that they had been arrested by dozens.
This age, which later confirmed that the 70 percent of them had no penal presumption.
- Almost over 80 per cent of the people who live with them, and many of them are criminals.
So we're still meeting them, Albenc said.
In order to process a more rapid state of children, the officers have created new rules, according to them, they must appear at the court in a month, and not as in the case of 60 days, in the statement of the workers of shelters.
Many of them will appear in a call through the video conference to ask an immigrationist state legal.
If they don't decide that they're not adequate to receive help, they'll be released at once.
The more time the children passed in watch centers, the more chances to increase their anxiety and depression, the more they might be attempted to entangle or to escape by the energetic vulnerability or by reports that have been made on the system during the last few months.
The defenders of the children say that such troubles are increased in the great installs like Tornillo; for it is so great that there is more probability in not seeing children's affairs.
Besides, they have said that if children are led to the camp to prepare emotionally, without time to say good-bye to their friends, they may increase the trauma which they already have.
He asked the Siberian to get away immediately with it, France, and Turks.
In the General of the United Nations, the Minister of the foreign affairs of Walid, Walid-Mule, has also called them back to his home, although the war of the country has been in his eighth year.
Moulelem, who is the successor of the Prime Minister, has said that the foreign force is illegal in the country of Syria, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and will be treated like -
- In a moment they must get out of the country without any conditions, he said in the committee.
Moulem said that the war against the Syrian - terrorism is almost over - 36,000 people have died in this war since 2011, and millions of people have had to leave their houses.
And Damascus said, \"Siry will continue to fight in the holy battle until we wash all the lands of Syria?\" And from the terrorists, too, the presence of foreigners.
U.S. 2,000 soldiers in Syracuse, one most of them advocate and arabian forces against President Bashard.
France has 1,000 soldiers on the land where war has destroyed them.
As for the theme of the refugees, Moulem said that there are suitable conditions to return to them, and - he cast some of them to some westward countries that push the refugees to the refugees to stop them.
- We call the local community and the Hungarian institutions to get back to them, he said.
- They're just humanitarians, they're just pleasurable?
The United States and the European Union have remarked that no help can be made to rebuild Syria, till the Ossad and the opossess arrive at a political end of the war.
Newly, Russia and Turkey have made an agreement to create a shelter in the last fort of Idliben; if we believe that the diplomats of the United States have been able to promote the political conversation.
This agreement between Russia and Turkey had been avoided in the province of three millions of inhabitants.
But Moulem said that the agreement is at the end - it has its agreements clean, and has stated that military action will have yihadsists, including Al-Qaeda's close-topped Nousra front fighters, which will be done.
The courier of the United States in Staff, expects the first meetings of the new assembly, and the members of the oligarchy, to begin to form a constitution of war, and even to extend the course of elections.
Mouelem has set up several conditions in which the government of Syria shares in this assembly, and that the work of the assembly is to be renewed, and that the article of the constitution must be restricted, and no one else must enter it.

External money is entering the bar at the most equal elections in the United States Congress.
It is no surprise to know that the money is entering the barbar on the 17th of Pennsylvania; for the congress has been rebuilt, and consequently they are fighting for a chair.
This division of Pittsburg, which has recently been rebuilt by the frontier, is the Conor Lamb, who obtained his chair in the special elections of another diversion.
Lambio has a new trumpet, the same as the Kith Rothfus of the Republican Party, representing the 12th Disturbation of Pennsylvania, which is distinctly leveled with 17th.
In January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania established that the constitutions were Manipulated against the republicans; and consequently the borders of the maps were declared as necessary.
17. This new diversion has caused a close competition for the funds of the campaign in the principal source of the parties: the congression of the democratic campaign (DCCC) and the national Committee of the Republican Communciation (NRCC).
Lamb became known to Pennsylvania because he had won in March the special elections of the Pennsylvania 18th Congress.
It was the chair of a Republican in the last decade, and the president Donald Trump won it with the advantage of 20 points.
In the political stages, the democracies have a certain advantage.
The US considered El Salvador punishing for China, but then he decided to turn back.
The diplomats have stated that the Domini-American Republic and Panama have already acknowledged that Washington has almost not asked to postpone them.
Trump had a nice meeting with President Juan Carlos Valan in June 2017, and Panaman was the owner of a hotel, until the concierges decided to throw up the group of Trumps.
The officers of the State Department decided to leave El Salvador, Domini, and Panama to the new decisions - according to the voice of the department, as Heatheruer of the Department, in the beginning of a month.
But the punishments were considered only against El Salvador, who got 140 million in the United States as helpful in 2017, others to control the traffic of the repugnance and support the development.
Amongst the propounded pennies there are comparatively aggressive reductions of help, which would be extremely harmful for the country of the Central America, because they are large edifices and murder rates.
As the inner viler advanced, the officers of North America and of the Central America delayed a higher conference about security and economic prosperity, which, as it advanced, was intended to succeed a meeting which had been made for the previous year, and the Immigranean endeavoured to avoid going to the United States.
But in the middle of September, the principal officers of the administration made it clear that they wanted to make a conference, and so they declared that the sentence of El Salvad was cancelled.
It is expected that the President Mike Pence is part of the conference that has changed towards the middle of October, the signal for the importance of the administrator at the meeting, as the diplomats say.
The three American couriers have returned to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominian Republic, without a message or a severe punishment.
A Volton's electrical voter in the White House refused to give an statement about the details the three American American officers had discussed. There were two diplomats between officers who had agreed to keep in exchange for the anonymousness which they had agreed to inform us of.

The prosecutor Robert Muller will soon be released to show whether Trump should interfere with justice; for there is a great deal of evidence in public point of view.
Besides this, Russia has attacked the United States elections whether Trump's campaign was being accompanied by Muller.
If the majority of Congress change, Trump will have to give him further instructions, while at any time it is necessary that he should appear before a censorship of his equals.
There are many conditions for that, however, and I don't mean that Trump's unfavourable dedication, or even the European equivalent of Trump.

The Americans are at this point in front of a series of inflexions.
What should we do if Trump fires the general prosecutor for Rod Rosenstein? It's Roseins who controls what's going to happen with Mueller's investigation.
Rosenstein's job has been in danger since this newspaper suggested that the president had been writing secretly, and that the president had stated that it was inappropriate for his office.
Rosenstein says that what The Times has been given is not correct.
-How shall we answer about Brett Kavanaugh, if the whole investigation which has been asked for the FBI, or if he receives any confirmation of the Judge of the Supreme Court, even though they have been trusted to him by the counterfeit and false testimony?

Leave Chequers and listen to it?
\"The Prime Ministers, to follow the job, must hold their word.

- Now, our (monger) and this is the question of our political class, he said.
- They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know that they won't let them come out with them?
I want you to address our political class to the public full of life, who is about to betray Brexit.
- We're fighting the army of the people who gave us victory in Brexit, and we won't rest until the United Kingdom becomes independent and self-connomous -
Meanwhile their side of the town was about to go through Birmingham before a deputation of two hours.
A few visuals lifted notes against Brexit after the party magazine this weekend.
Adonis, who had a laborious member, laughed at the conservatives of the conservatives, who at first had security problems with the party.
-They are the people that tell us that the ICT systems can function properly, and in Ireland, the whole technology of Canda Plus plus, of no limit, was added to the free trade of unbounded commerce -

Russian Grand Prix race: Lewis Hamilton obtained the title of the group after he won Sebastian Vettel
It was clear that on Saturday, since Valttatre Bottas Lewis was classed before Mercedes Hamilton, the orders of the Mercedes would be to die or to live.
At first Bottas was doing fine, and almost threw Hamilton out to defend his place, and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vetttel entered the box first, and Hamilton had to get into the final traffic, which would have to have been correct in the race.
One of Mercedes came in to the box later, and went out behind Vettel, but after one of the others Hamiltons, who had premeditated Hamilton; for he left the inner part of Ferrari, after a double movement to defend his post.
Max Verstapen was a 21-year year old, and the race began to run, and ended at the seventh place.
After that he settled himself in the first position in a large part of the race, and for the end he held the pneumatic races to finish quickly and to get Kim to the Raikon station and get the fourth place.
At last, 44 went back to the box, but it was not possible to live the rhythm left on eight o'clock, and Raikkon got the fourth position.
It's not a simple day, Valttrie's been doing a great job over the weekend, and it's been really cool.
The team has worked a great job on any of the people?' Hamilton said.
They were inappropriate gestures.
President Donald Trump laughed at the Senator Diane Feistein on Saturday in a marching order that Brettt Kavanagh of the Supreme Court, the name of Christine Forlas Ford, did not prove it.
Virginia was celebrated at the West when he spoke, the President did not give a proper reference to the testimony given before the Consciousness of the Senate's Committee.
-The only thing that can be found, and for the last few days you see what is going on in the Senate, that you see in anger, you see people who are angry, you see that people are false, false, and false?
- Because you see the riddles and leaks and say -O, I was not.
It wasn't me?
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you trust the letter?
Do you remember his answer?
Oh, no.
I didn't trust him -
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't trust him?' she added, imitated the reaction of the senator.
He went to the July with the details of the allegations against Kavanagh, which Ford sent to Fénstein, and was shot up in the September, but Féinstein refused the leak that happened in his office.
-I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't trust his story?
- He asked me to keep him in silence, and I kept him secret, just as he asked me to?
But what he refused was not welcome at the president's side, and he declared this in the phantom that he had celebrated on Saturday night.
Perhaps it was not him, but those were the most inappropriate gestures I have ever seen?
The president declared that the democracies are being used for their purposes.
- They're ready to do anything to recover their power.
They're evil, they don't care who hurt them to get over the power and control they're going on?' said the president, as the Medicaite has given him to know.

An analyst makes the chronology of the night they burned a woman alive
The prosecutor delayed the case on Saturday on 2014 in the new trial of a man who was burned by a woman of Mississippi alive.
Analyst Paul Rowlett had testified for some hours as an almond of the United States.
As he introduced the jury, he used the mobile phone records that were accused of Quinton Tellis 29, and Jessica Chambers killed the movements they had killed during the night.
Rowlett said that the woman died in the evening she had received a number of cell phones with the Telis Chambers, so she lied on the previous assertion in Tellis, according to the Claion Ledger.
According to the details, the mobile phone at Tellis was with the Chambers at the moment when Telis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then he turned to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the judge on Saturday, and testified that it was not that day.
When the prosecutor told him that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, \"In the palaces, where the truck was at Nashville?\"
There was another incoherence-Telis said he knew two weeks ago when Chambers died.
But, according to the mobile phone records, they met only a week ago.
Rowlett said, after the death of Chambers, Tellis had deleted the text messages from Chambers, calls, and contact information from the phone.
-He removed his life? Hale said.
Defense will begin on Sunday with the last seeds.
As the judge says, the trial will pass that day from the jury.
The High Breed, what's the hup-hop conscious?
A trio of hyp-hop music wants to challenge people who have a negative opinion of the kind of music, and they fill their music with positive message.
The High Breeds are saying that the Hipp-Hop music has abandoned political messages from its principles and social problems.
They want to return to his roots, and get him to know the hyp-hops again.
Some artists, like The Fugees and Common, have seen the resurrection of such hypp-hope in the United Kingdom by the Americans and Lowkey artists.

\"My wife sent him something she didn't want to tell him.
He's not a racist.
We're not a racist!\" Joel Plasco explained to the Post Log.

Paddington's publisher were afraid of a bear that wouldn't be satisfied with the readers, as a new letter has been shown
Bond's daughter, Karen Karen Karachel, who was born a little after this, said in a letter, \"It's hard to place it in front of someone who read it before.\"
It's very amusing to know now that we know about Paddington's great success.
Father BBC was a cameraman from the chain before he was inspiring to write a book for children, as he said, his father had a positive attitude for his work, and he added that he had a taste for the publisher of the book.
As for Paddington, he says it was an important member of the family, and then he was proud of success.
- He was silent, and he wasn't proud? - He said.
- But Paddton was so real to him that he almost felt as if he were a child who achieves something, that you are proud of it, though not really your achievement.
I think that's how he saw Padding's success.
Although he had been a creation of his imagination, he always confessed to Paddington himself a merit?
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello to her on the phone.
As soon as they landed, the daughter was taken to the Hospital Louis Postal 2 Hospital, but the doctors couldn't do anything to save her life.
-Nad called it a lot to say it was very serious, he didn't think he was going to leave? said Mrs.
- After that, I got a call from Nad, to say he'd die in two minutes and say I'd have to say hello to him.
And I did.
I said, \"Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors gave him the heart to beat, and the medicants were gradually exhausting and letting his system go.
He died a little before he thought he was dead, and it ended.
I could only sit and wait, knowing that everything would begin.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should have kept him-'
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laprouse, who had been afflicted by her daughter's death, went up to the plane with the rest of her travellers, and had forgotten her sorrow.
-No one knew? - He said.
-I was bent on my head, and tears went down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but in the flight, I felt sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved him?

The two women who have lost two women who loved suicide want to avoid losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphys put tickets on a Gales bridge, these cards have a phony and phone numbers so people can call for help.

Davis is 45 and lives in Lydney; he said, his son was a special gift for cooking, and he was smiling contagiously.
- They all knew it because of the smile.
They always said that his smile lit wherever it was?
But he left the job before he died -- it was in the dark place -- it was.
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother found his brother after he had taken his life.
'I wonder if it'll be dominated?'
Davis had created a number of cards which might help you tell them that the suitors are going to know that there is something wrong with you and that you can help you, even if you're a friend.
Don't shut up, you need to talk?
Mrs. Humphys and Mme. Davies have been friends for a long time, and she was one of her partners for 15 years old, and she lost her mother shortly.
-He didn't say he was sad, not even depressed? - He said.
- A couple of days before Christmas, we realized that he had changed his attitude.
On Christmas Day he was plunged; when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them?
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they must go on: - He leaves a gap in the family.
He's ruining us.
But we all have to go on and fight?

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at the head after the FBI research started.
-I thought if we could get something like what he asked for, like a limited or restricted investigation, we might get a little union, said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and he added that he was afraid that the Committee was cutting it down - in front of the annoyance of the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans want to investigate the case?
The opposite opinion is for time.
There are only five weeks left to elections, which will be the 6th of November, and the Republicans hope to produce bad results, and if so, they will be very weakened by the choice of the Supreme Court of the Country to which they please.
George W. Bush has made a lot of telephone calls to the senators, and he has put his pressure on Mr. Kavanagh's protection; for Mr. Kavanagh did his work at the White House, and he recognized his wife by her, Ashley, who was the personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI report?
In the Senate, where 51 republicans and 49 Democratic times sit.
There is not yet any light in the Senate where Mr. Kavanaugh can vote at least 50 votes; if so, the President Mike Pence would break the selection and introduce it to the Supreme Court.

The number of persons who escape from North Korea are down since Kim Jong-un took the seven years ago, as a legislator of South Korea has said.
Park Byong-segreeung, speaking of the data of the Attorney Attorney of South Korea, said that they had been fugitives in the year before, was in 2011 on the side of the fugitives.
Mr. Park said that the power of controls between North Korea and China has been very much influenced by the setting aggressors to the people's aggressors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
Almost all the fugitives in North Korea are offered to the inhabitants of South Korea sooner or later.
Seoul says more than 3,000 North Crees have crossed since the War of Korea was over 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which is the longest border on North Korea, and it is easier to cross than that of the two Demilitary regions which are hard to cross.
China considers them as an external immigrant, not as a refugee, and frequently subdue them.
North Korea and South Korea are still in the war, the relationship between them has been highly improved for the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries joined Pyongyangen to discuss the negotiations on the nuclearization.
In June, the correlative of the President of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un was an historical meeting between Singapore and nuclear penins.
But on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, who is the minister of the Outer Appears of North Korea, did not advance from the hour when the U.S.
-If we don't trust him, we'll never trust him in our national security, and so we won't leave our weapons first, Rie said in a conference of the United States of New York.
Nancy Pelosi-Chisteric - told Brett Kavanaugh, and he's not ready to be in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, who is the leader of the minors of the Gubans, told him that Brett Kavanaugh is the candidate, and that he is not ready to be in the Supreme Court.

-I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted like that, -
Kavanaugh denied that Christine Blasey Ford had been a sexual attack on both of them when they were teenagers.
In the first speech, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and sometimes he was almost yelling and talking about his family and his youth.
He also accused the Democracies of the Committee, and his repugnant allegations against Hilly Clinton to the president of 2016, the Liberals who have been angry for having lost the elections of the Liberals -- organized and insulted?
Pelosi said that the testimony of Kavanaugh is not in the Supreme Court, because he has shown that he has an indispensable opinion against the democrats.
- With these affirmations and the position he had against the Clintmont and the Democrats, he was out of his way? - He said.
Pelosi objected to the choice of Kavanaugh, and if the democrats obtained the majority of the Ordress in the House of Ordors, he asked if he would resist him.
-I'm going to say this, if he doesn't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not ready to be in the court, not to be in the court at this moment, said Pelosi.
At this moment, Kavanaugh D.C. is the judge of the court of the Circuit Court.
As Pellos added, as a democrat, he is concerned with the judgment of a law which Kavanaugh has made for available medical career, or against Roe v. Wade, which applies the preservation of justice.
At the confirmation court Kavanaugh's court he avoided questions when they asked him to turn back certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
-A hysterical and injectives can't go to the court and hope we'll take it right?
And the women have to order.
The speech of justice is the terrible rage of months and years, and he cannot free himself without weeping.
- When we get used to it we cry - Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
- I don't think it's weird, do I?
And she went on: \"A woman in a place where the executive was, and said to me that she was crying too, but that she was sore when she began to cry, and she said to the person who was talking to her, 'You can think I'm sad.'
But I'm angry?
And then he went on.
And I thought it was a great idea.
They're not in the wrong way to express the anger, because they actually interpret them badly.
I remember something that happened to me in one of my first jobs. He was in a office most of them.
- Don't ever let them see you crying - he told me.
- They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they'll feel good because they understand you?
Patricia Schroeder Kolodrad was a democrat then, and he worked with Gary Hart for his president's presidency.
In 1987, when M. Hart had found himself caught in a boat called Monkey Buses, and his wife was not a woman of love with another woman, and she refused the race, Mademoiselle Schroeder decided to be the candidate to be the president.

- There were already seven more candidates in the past, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
- Someone called White Eduard and seven gnomes.
He decided that it wouldn't go in until he had collected 2 million dollars a day.
The fight was lost.
He knew that 1,000 men had given him $10,000 to the men who only gave him $250.
- They think I have a discount? - he asked himself.
When he made a speech and announced that the campaign would not be going to officially, he was much moved to the public thanks to the people, who protected him from collecting money and representatives, so difficult was the frustration of the system, and the anger of sexists.
-You'd have thought I was so nervous... - she explained about the reaction that Miss Schroeder had seen.
- You'd have thought Kleenex was my career.
I remember thinking about this: what will they write in my grave?
- He cried -

-Weshington's politicians would quickly decide on some of the two countries that would produce economically economical conditions.
