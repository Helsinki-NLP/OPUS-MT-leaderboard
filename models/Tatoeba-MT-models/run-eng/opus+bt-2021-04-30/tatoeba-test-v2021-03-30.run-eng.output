You have to go there and bring them.
Why are you heck?
He looks like my father.
Don't stop him.
I'm new here.
I will not step aside.
We know what you do.
How's your father doing?
I know what they said.
Why don't we go together?
We'll meet again!
Rest!
I don't have a place to live.
You can.
Last year I gave birth to my firstborn.
I'm sure I've probably seen him.
You're a good man.
Where's your family?
It would have been better if you hadn't gone.
I'm not hungry.
I'm a college sweetheart.
I left my keys.
We're not alone.
I want you to know.
I wanted to ask, what's your profit?
No one knew what was needed to be accomplished.
It caused me to think of you.
I'm one of your nephews.
Why don't you learn French anymore?
It's not like you think.
I want to see you, pe.
I'm glad you're there.
When do you get up?
Tom knows why? Tom:
What's my watch?
We don't have any money.
I'm sorry!
I don't need it.
I said everything to my parents.
There's no other way.
I know what to do.
I know where he is.
It's very good.
Time doesn't just cool, it's even astonished.
I lost my pen.
When do you get up?
You can pick up the ink that's all the one you like.
He cooked all the tambourine.
They don't have money.
You're a good father.
Come on or?
I want to pack you up.
You want to get rich?
I have headaches.
If you don't hear it, they come.
This is my father.
I want to know, Nico.
What, I don't understand?
I don't think he's coming.
I can't believe it.
They say he's very rich.
His word was wonderful.
I don't want to cook.
Don't do it again.
He doesn't know her very well except for his parents.
I could have.
I don't think he's coming.
He's got a crush on her.
The sun shines in the east.
Why don't you do it?
It will be very good.
All right.
I remember where the past is.
You want to take them?
It's called ngwiki and?
You run away from me saying it.
My brother's not at home.
My parents call me down.
What do they do here?
You have a brother?
Look at this picture.
I'm in the car.
What are you capable of?
This is your mama?
Why does the sky look blue?
When you don't, they come.
This car is ours.
Nobody has a car here.
Pick us up!
I don't know the word.
You know me.
I'm glad he's alive you are.
We're the ones you're looking for?
Forget it!
What's this thing for?
It doesn't give me a privilege.
My daughter will be led in the sixth month.
I know these women.
I understand what you're saying.
I'm sorry.
Where do you know my name?
You want it or?
This is love?
You know where I live?
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December are twelve months of the year.
I have a question.
I heard you were married.
You leave or?
In the past he was a teacher.
I've got a crush on him.
Nagasaga!
Who do you consider me?
I see it, too.
You want to see it.
The oath is a debt.
He doesn't live with you.
I don't like these people.
You want something to drink?
You're glad?
No doubts!
No one listens.
I'd pretend it's for your sake.
Take a taxi that takes you to a hotel.
You're not coming, are you?
Nguyo is coming!
They give him.
I don't know how long.
Whom does this bag belong to?
Come back?
Kazibe!
No one knows what needs to be done.
Don't look down.
I'll ask him.
We're back.
I'll see you.
I know a lot about you.
All right.
I want to learn French.
My car's dead.
You know I love you.
I know him.
Listen!
I know what to do.
I know what's happening.
He's thrown the key to his car.
Why aren't you in my house?
I can see it again?
You know how to separate sheep from goats?
You don't know my brother.
I'm taking you to school.
I know Tom?
It's satisfied with you?
Come back again?
It's what makes me love you.
You're yours?
It's gonna get hot.
I'm asking you, give me a file.
It's on the eve.
It's overheated.
You know I love you.
This bed is so warm.
Our journey comes from time.
I took the money.
What do you want to watch?
How do you go to school?
You're new?
I know what needs to be done.
You like to learn?
You owe me money?
I don't know how.
I know how it's done.
What shoes?
I'm glad you're there.
This book is very good.
Thank you for killing us home.
I respect them.
Let me down too much!
He's strong.
That's five dollars.
Run to my mama's house.
It's perfect.
Your pants are dirty.
I'm picking you up.
Thank you for passing by.
You like to learn?
I'll give it to you.
Share it! Drink.
I want the same.
You're my friend.
What's our car?
No one knows what needs to be done.
What school do you attend?
You don't want to know!
He's a good prodigy.
Gives me a thought.
Take a book and read.
I don't have a home.
Thank you very much.
I know you said it.
I'm thinking of you.
He's glad.
I'm hungry.
You don't know me.
Don't look at me like that.
I thought you'd come home.
My daughter's gonna be led in the heaviest.
He was raised to his great-grandson.
I left you.
I want to go home.
They don't know.
I have my older brother.
I've done this robe for you.
How long do you want to keep it?
This morning I leave him before two o'clock.
I threw away my glasses.
Why are they here?
What is love?
We understand.
I like this book.
I suggest you read the notes below.
You're the woman I love.
I'll be interesting to you.
It's ours.
Where's your family?
Don't say this word again.
OK, I'll call it.
Where do we go?
I don't understand how.
You know where I'll be.
What's the purpose of your visit?
We are glad to see them.
I know this girl.
Stop that car.
How do I not understand.
You know what you're supposed to do?
We know you.
No, thank you.
Where do you want to live?
I love where I live.
Don't ask.
I have to open the window?
"With a Few Raindrops".
Where do you go?
You look even though you're so excited.
You have to go home.
He's living here?
You learn French?
You will be very repentant.
They're suing me.
What's my car?
I don't know how.
I saw my brother there.
I know what I do.
I gave a boy a book.
Who's your teacher?
I do it for you.
This girl's dressed up like a guy.
I don't have my brother.
It's sad, my oldest friend moved, moved to another town.
They live in your house?
You know I have to go.
Here's your book.
It's not my day.
How long has he been sick?
If he had kept running under it, he would not have had an accident.
He does not speak only English, he also speaks German.
I don't like you.
I know what's happening.
I know you know.
It's okay, sis?
I know what you're thinking.
You're burning.
Ijipo wasn't complete so I had to change it.
It would have been better if you hadn't gone.
This girl's dressed up like a guy.
I like to see you cook.
I have to fix my hair.
Too little?
The owner of something is my brother.
I'm glad for the happy one.
Do you have a moment to help me with something?
Give it to her.
I don't know how to take names.
You know what's love?
The wedding will take place on Saturday.
If I didn't eat I'd die.
Tell me your plan.
What is this book on the table?
I lost my pen.
Thank you for coming.
I'm a chef.
Someone's standing behind the wall.
I stole it from 'em.
Look it out.
You see?
They're looking at us?
You're a good dancer?
When I've climbed this hill I'm running, it's all the flow.
There's Nyoko?
We came to see you.
Bobo are kids.
Believe me to bow, Tom. Relax!
Don't forget to carry a letter.
I know you love me.
Where there's the will there's the way.
I'm going to school here too.
I don't have a brother.
"I'm hurting myself with the su on the toki".
What do you look at?
I'll rob you.
You know where he is?
What's your daddy?
Don't ask me again.
The Father Is Home.
Ijipo is superior to me.
These are Japanese?
Give me a book.
You're a good man.
The windows are oriented south.
If I forget to buy a sandwich.
I'll go to God's bottom.
I don't see you.
Where do you come from?
We're here for you.
I don't know where she lives.
There's a hundred people in the hall.
I understand.
The chimney has no teeth.
I'm not satisfied.
My dream has been the truth.
You can approach me.
I don't know what to say...
You know where he is?
I'm not an Assyrian in college.
Let me see.
You're home?
Do good to those who hate you.
Utahari is not the same thing.
Too little.
Assanser doesn't work under this one.
We're so excited.
This girl looks good.
Come on, look at me.
I'm not a very good carpenter.
You don't know me.
Tell them what happened.
I thought you'd come home.
I did it for you.
I love your car.
Who's your teacher?
You come home?
It's interesting to you?
It's complete.
No fanfare.
Did I love you?
I don't know him.
I'm glad you're there.
I need to be fucked up.
I gave you up.
Do not make sentences with no mistakes, you can make them in a different way.
I don't know what to think of it.
I don't know what to do.
What causes people to do as this happens?
Where am I?
You know his name?
It's gone money.
I want to borrow a car.
I want to go too.
It doesn't look good.
What's your watch?
We spilled.
It's all right!
I left my keys.
I don't understand this word.
I don't know you're here under this one.
I'm looking for you.
You see this house? It's my house.
Your car interests me.
They say he's very rich.
No one knows.
You go or don't you go?
We're not going with each other.
In the past there was a temple here.
I know you said it.
Oh, I'm cool.
Why don't you go home?
And you think so?
It doesn't give me a privilege.
What do you want to watch?
Why do you ask?
Nguyo is coming!
Don't look at me happy.
I'm sure you're pretty strong.
He takes what you want.
I know this girl.
It wasn't dead.
You're a good father.
You want a car?
I don't have money.
Do your schoolwork.
I want to accompany you.
I just know his name.
She looks like her mother.
I'll make you happy.
We understand.
How's the family doing?
I speak a little Spanish.
Confirm!
How old is he?
I have to figure out the reasons.
You're not my brother.
My family is small.
Tom knows the reason?
That's my home?
I like math.
I know how to do it.
Utahari is not the same thing.
It's nothing.
We see each other.
Hello!
What's Tom?
Relax.
Where do you get it?
I'm not sure about French.
When are you leaving?
They don't have money.
Tell them what happened.
This phone number is yours?
I don't cook.
It's not a Faransite.
Stop looking at me!
Sooner or later it will be.
They saw me.
It's all about travel?
I don't know you're here under this one.
He screwed his head.
You're home?
It's not something to brag about.
Come on high!
I like this car.
I know where I have to take charge.
Your O looks like your A.
How much does it cost?
Take them around.
It's not out there!
Where do you want to live?
Look at him.
No one listens to me.
Don't forget to carry a letter.
We're here because of you.
What do you see?
Why am I here?
Take off your shoes.
They know us.
When do you get up?
I'm not going to quit.
I'm from England.
You run away from me saying it.
Stop provoking me to say it.
The windows are open.
You don't have to come.
No one listens.
I don't ever forget the eyes.
I don't think he's coming.
All right.
Rice is cooked as follows.
I know how it's done.
No one asked you.
They want us to do it.
What do you see out there?
I knew it interested you.
I'm not going to look there.
What's Tom?
This is French?
The owner of the pubs is my sister.
From tomorrow we can go to work.
We have arrived.
I learn the French that pays for him.
Thank you for listening.
I know where they're going.
It's a fantastic book.
Our carryings are tired.
I know your father.
I learn French in the classroom.
You have to go home.
Where did everyone go?
You can open the window?
You're gonna go out this summer, are you?
What's my mommy?
It didn't happen now, when?
And your quest?
What's your car?
My father is not home to me.
No question.
You know something?
I don't have a crush on you.
You get it here?
No rich people live here.
In this gant there is an axe on the blade.
You know him.
I would be interested in seeing him.
My father's not at home.
Heba!
This phone call is for you?
You can kick a song.
Forgive me so much!
I know how to do it very well.
I'm not hungry.
I was going to say that you can approach me.
Where are we?
Love is blind.
Let me summon it.
I know you have it.
I'm not an Assyrian.
I'll try it.
Strong wind blows and I can't move quickly.
Maybe you don't like it.
I saw some of my sister.
I'm not quitting.
How much time will be left for you?
He looks like his Father.
What's that?
You're a success.
My house is next to the "house" of worship.
He's betrayed on a word!
All apples that fall on the ground will be eaten by pigs.
I couldn't cry.
I don't want to read them.
No one knows his name.
You know where they are?
Where do you go to school?
What are you?
What a point!
He gave it to me.
I don't see him.
What's the matter with ya?
Listen to me.
Why do people say that?
The carpets of the past are of great value.
I swear.
I don't understand French.
There's no one there!
Why do I have to do it?
It's Saturday.
So I did.
I'm a chef.
How many?
We don't have money.
I know you listen.
Take off your shoes.
I know what you look like.
I'm glad.
This car's new?
Why don't you come in?
He did not read this book.
I don't want to be rich.
You're sorry I said it.
The tortoise has no teeth.
That'll make me happy.
You can go.
When do you come home?
He did not read this book.
You have to get up.
We love you.
This book is new.
You know him.
He's a Frenchman.
I don't have a car.
Take care of your head.
Why don't you make it clear what you have in mind?
I want you to see him.
You can use this car.
He doesn't know me.
I'm a teacher.
I love her.
I'm not an Assyrian.
You want to see that?
Stop saying that!
I love you.
He came on his own.
I bought eggs and less milk.
One pipeline is missing.
I saw him again.
This is your mother?
We grew up together.
It was a plan for me?
You're looking for us?
I'll be in my car.
I don't like running.
He's a Frenchman.
He's a tall guy.
I know what they are.
You know how best to do it.
I have a car.
When are you coming to your house?
In the evening from six o'clock to two is the time to rejoice.
You didn't have to come.
You're supposed to give up alcohol.
Let's get it for your mother.
Where there's the will there's the way.
Where did you stop the car?
Call me between 1 and 2 o'clock.
You have a bazooka in your mouth, cut it down.
Let me do what - a pants or a jipo?
What book?
American?
What does it look like?
Stop looking at me!
I'm reading a book.
Read!
I don't know anything about it.
It's not what you think.
Come with us?
What's your stuff?
It's a mistake for me?
I don't drink.
Nguyo is coming!
I won't let
I'm cool for you, bitch.
We're glad.
Storage of cool, dry surfaces.
It doesn't honor me.
I take it.
I'm not hungry.
I understand.
Not well.
I learn French in the classroom.
Why'd it shut up?
I want you to go home to her.
She looks like her mother.
You're looking for me?
Put it on your mother.
You know I have to go.
What car?
You love him?
We're supposed to put a balance between 'output' and 'output'.
The snake swallowed a frog.
They don't come this below.
You know what you ask?
Open the window!
Welcome home!
This guy is their brother.
Why aren't you at school?
Why don't we go home?
I can come in?
You know I love you.
"Researchers found on 'human bones' in cave".
Our journey depends on time.
Can I see it again?
These steps can prevent the mold from being digested.
Here's the bills.
We are taught to eat at noon together.
Don't be angry!
It's not an appointment. We're just going to cenema.
I loved him.
Why don't we go home?
Sohoka in my room!
I'm new here.
I want to learn French.
I'll come pick you up.
I don't have my sister.
I sleep naked.
I've got bad luck.
The water is soaked.
If I had known I would have left.
I say what I think.
What price?
I know where we are.
Why don't they come?
I'm going to get my car.
Why aren't you in class?
We are university students.
I don't know his name.
I'm gonna leave and smell.
How do you go to school?
I'm sorry!
Stop it.
Don't throw me to say it!
You know what a caco?
You're sorry I said it.
I know his family.
I know what's going on.
I left my keys.
I take this.
It doesn't give me a privilege.
What's the reason for your visit?
Why don't we look at them?
He does not speak English.
I ate eggs yesterday.
It's okay, isn't it?
We know him.
I want a little rest.
No one asked you.
I'm not hungry.
I was in a bad mood.
I talked about everything to my parents.
I get up at 1 a.m.
Don't open the window.
Come on, look at yourself.
Why aren't you there?
Why hot?
All the days go to work on foot, except when there's rain.
It's ours.
Don't look under.
How's your sister doing?
Can we have a place to talk?
Where are you taking us?
I loved this car.
Why do you learn French?
I think so too.
I see you.
I know if you obey it.
He accused the man of theft.
I've done this robe for you.
I don't hear you.
I don't know their names.
Talk to me about your plan.
I know what to do.
They say he's very rich.
Your pants are dirty.
You're German, sco?
You like it?
"These glasses are for me?"— "Then the same is the Father."
You don't need to thank me.
What happened to you yesterday evening?
We want you to take it.
She looks like her mother.
That we're alone, let's have fun.
We came to see you.
You want it or?
It's not my car.
I don't know his name.
You want something to drink?
You don't know what happened at all, do you?
I know what's love.
Sico one.
The tyrant jumps.
What do you do here?
Here's the bills.
No one prepares me.
We learn in one class.
You got it?
It caused me to think of you.
You've got rice?
He's living here?
We'd go together.
We are born.
I know why you're here.
Why do you attend college?
What's the matter with ya?
Sooner or later it will happen.
When is Utaha?
I've stumbled on my toe.
I'm satisfied.
Listen to your mother!
Read this.
I'll give it to you.
What information?
Get out of my room!
This tea's a bad one?
You want something to drink?
I'm the youngest.
How much does it cost?
I want you to read this book.
I'm from Bresil.
I'm here to take you home.
We learn in one class.
You don't forget us!
I write on us.
Don't give the barangay sentences without a miss.
You have this money?
Too little.
It's his job.
Here's what you asked for.
He's my brother.
What are you looking for?
He buys you?
He's got a crush on her.
I want to see.
Stop giving orders here!
One time we go to the cinema.
You live here, sis?
You read this book?
What are we?
Why do we do it?
These are too long.
You believe I'm okay?
There are slits in it's remains.
He's my brother.
It's his job.
You know what they said?
I don't understand.
They don't know anything about it.
He's an American?
Coffee or tea?
What was going on in the bottom?
I'm sorry I left you in the dune.
We're on our own.
I like what I do.
My voice is crazy because of the cough.
You know what he said?
His word was wonderful.
When do you want to go?
I don't understand things like that.
That's better?
Those from Japanese?
I'll try.
He knows you love him?
We're losing expensive time.
Why don't you quit?
Start a sentence discourse that is appropriate for you not to be distracted by other languages.
What's his family?
Magdalena and Ania are best friends.
I'm glad for the happy one.
We should have lunch together.
Take one.
You have a brother?
We passed it together.
I believe in you.
I have to think.
What's the matter with Mary?
I'm kidding.
I have to finish.
I'm glad he's alive you are.
You think he's excited?
Why aren't you with me?
No one is at home.
Let me say it.
He loved her.
She's not pregnant.
Why don't they like me?
How many bills?
What did you give me?
Go outside.
Tom Carpenter.
I'm not rich.
He wipes a sweat on his face.
I'm not satisfied.
The shell!
I'll get involved.
How many nights?
We'll be able to.
Greetings and greetings.
You have to go home.
He looks like his Father.
You're told to lead me.
You know where she lives?
It doesn't interest me.
Why don't you go with me?
Give me your watch.
You have my money?
This damn is pretty good.
I thought you'd come home.
I don't have a brother.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't know how to keep names.
You can repeat?
I'm taking it.
You know these people?
This suit is for you?
Why do I do it?
I don't understand you.
This automaker factory.
I'm not an Assyrian.
We make sense.
Don't do it again.
Watch 'em out the window.
It doesn't interest me.
One pipeline is missing.
He's taking money.
He's glad.
A run in a car.
You want to know why?
You want to find them?
Remember your kindness and ignore more.
I'm the youngest.
What do you think this is?
We want lectures in the everyday language.
So it brought you here?
I don't understand.
I came to study.
No one said a word.
We are born.
It's overheated.
So I did.
I have to learn.
Thank you very much!
It's about him.
It cheers you?
You're ours.
The plan was one for me?
I don't have any more sister-in-law.
We are university students.
No new.
Come on? Yes or no?
Can't you get it back what you said?
No one saw something.
I'll try.
I wanted to ask, what's the test?
I know this girl.
What kind of books do you like to read?
He needs water.
Where did they take you?
All right.
It's interesting to me.
How many coffee cups did you drink?
This office is a mess?
This car is pretty good.
We hear.
Our burdens are exhausted.
We'll go with you.
Your data?
I know you have it.
I'm sorry to yell at you.
She lives with him.
I'm a teacher.
We came down and ran a hillbilly.
I can't remember any name.
You want to be rich?
I want to read this book.
I'm not lying at all.
I'm an Assyrian in college.
These are ours.
They don't want us to know.
It's not my car.
You've gone through the red light signal.
I know what I'm taught to learn.
I miss you so much.
I hear what you're saying.
I want you to go home.
We're taking all of us together.
Give an opportunity.
I'm not strong in it.
There's no one there!
It's not something to be proud of.
You understand French?
He makes me think.
It's on the eve.
This wine is for me?
I have my older brother.
They don't spend time in big.
You call me when you need help.
And me.
We broke up.
They're not rich here.
What does he want to achieve?
Listen to your mother!
I like math.
Nguyo is coming!
We're taking all of us there together.
We'll add in next week.
I like to watch you cook.
What do you do?
I'm taking a break.
And they come?
You know we love you.
You can separate sheep from goats.
I'll think about it.
No one listens to me.
I like to learn French.
"'We can take the beach this week's end'".
Why do they do it?
You're not coming, are you?
You have to go home.
How old is he?
I know you.
I won't let
He doesn't look happy.
I know where I have to take charge.
All days go to work on foot, except for the rain.
Thank you very much!
I don't want to quit.
What was going on in the bottom?
I'll see a drama.
It looks good.
I'm reading a book.
You know the owner of this car?
I'm taking a break.
You're a good prodigy.
Forget that.
I'm sure I saw him somewhere else.
Do you have a minute?
I like short hair.
You're planning to go to Congress?
Ijipo is fattened.
Don't send me.
They give him.
The shell!
Why do you think that?
I have sisters.
He's cut off his shitty shitty shitty shitty shitty shitty shitty.
He's coming with you?
He doesn't like us.
Hello!
It's not good.
I am assigned to learn French.
It will be very good.
I swear.
Enter.
Everything has a reward.
I've had the morning of a lot of missions.
It's very exciting for us.
Let's buy that.
I'm not a good man.
I know what I'm gonna do.
What do you want to know?
We know why you came here.
Grandma speaks softly.
I'll try it.
I like to learn French.
She's pregnant.
I wouldn't have come if I had known.
What do you think he is?
Can I open a curtain?
It was a day!
I know what to do.
I'm an Assyrian in college.
Listen to me.
Where's my money?
I've seen you.
You're home?
I know if you obey it.
I want to talk to you.
I'm interested in what I see.
I know what you're thinking.
Get away with it.
I learn the French that pays for him.
Your sister?
We are born.
They don't come this below.
The kids are going to school?
What are you looking for?
Where do you fail?
No one prepares me.
I'm not giving up.
Don't look at me like that.
He's taking money.
Why me?
I'll be back.
Make me leave you in the bud.
Get us!
This word comes from geek.
The bus is parked but not open.
You love him?
The road is a lot of noise.
I read his cheek.
Speak in French.
Dogs bury bones frequently.
Fill glass until middle or brown until middle?
Don't look at me like that.
Take him to the operating room.
We have often returned in disappointment.
Where do you know him?
Where do you want to go?
I have to stop.
It's too early for us to say that.
He's a good man.
I'll be interesting to you.
I want to see you again.
They're on my own!
I want to see you, pe.
Don't you expect it?
You're my friend.
Listen to me.
Why are you heck?
You're looking for this here?
The flowers you see are roses.
You're not strong in it.
We could go with you.
You know I love you.
We cook rice uku.
You're not my brother.
You're not coming, are you?
They come home to him.
I'm glad you're there.
I'll be able to.
You used to smoke, sis?
You can pick up the ink that's all there is to interest you.
It's not worth it.
It's a mistake for me?
You're a good cook.
This is a mistake?
You know what he said?
I was in a bad mood.
You want to know how?
The price goes up.
My left arm made a mess.
This real one is mine.
Smoking kills health.
Data drive is new.
I'm here to say goodbye.
I can't believe it.
Don't ask me what's wrong.
You need a plan.
You approach me.
You want to stop?
I love my family.
I don't want to be here.
You kids.
I need time to think.
This car is mine.
Close the window!
I don't feel French.
Don't forget to carry a letter.
I want to know, Nico.
You're entertaining.
I knew it pleased you.
That's annoying!
I knew it.
What is that thing you're looking for?
I loved you.
I don't know your name.
I'll take 'em a day off.
"Beware your head".
He has hundreds of books.
Don't listen to him.
Black is mine.
What do you do?
We want a complete sentences.
I'm still having a little knee pain.
This book doesn't have a call.
I don't want to see you.
He's a good prodigy.
You don't have to write a long letter.
Make me leave you in the bud.
You're a good prodigy.
What shoes?
"'This' has a fatality risk".
They rejoice.
You want to come in?
He loves her.
What's your daddy?
Read again.
I know you listen.
No one knows his name.
I'm gonna drive away.
You're not my brother.
He's working in the factory.
Let me say it.
Look there!
He's always without his mole.
I live here.
It's not worth it!
I know him.
Close the window.
The factory will start operating next year.
Prices rose.
This year I plan on reading as many books as possible.
I don't feel good about it here.
We are born.
The hand has five fingers: a thumb, a buck, a high, a low, a low.
I saw your father.
What are you reading?
No one is at home.
What's my car?
On the former the musée is always closed.
You have a car?
Why do they say that?
I don't know how to cook.
To store in a cold and dry state.
What do you think of Friday?
I'm glad he's alive you are.
It's about him.
"These glasses are for me?"— "These are for my Father."
I know what I'm gonna do.
He's not there.
Stop staring at her breasts!
This couch is yours?
If I ask you to give me a paper to write.
I don't want to know.
Don't forget to carry a letter.
If he had made you time he would have left.
The one who wants to marry him takes the initiative to communicate it well with his father.
He hears her.
I was going to make you know.
They're all very good.
How's the family doing?
You want to see.
We have arrived.
Let me read?
Why don't people like me?
I spend a lot of time learning the guitar.
It's not what you think it is.
I'm sorry I left you in the dune.
I'm hungry.
I'm not rich.
Why don't you listen?
Why do you have this?
What car?
I have to go now.
My car's dead.
We're home to him.
We are glad to see them.
How's your father doing?
I like math.
He doesn't know me.
Come tomorrow.
And I'm up.
My house is near the temple.
I know how they are used.
Get me out of here.
Let me see.
He's thrown the key to his car.
You're a new brat?
I'm sorry.
Why do we do this?
I'm sorry to insult you.
I don't have a car.
You're not coming, are you?
He's glad.
Because of you, I'm in trouble.
You remember?
Take it!
No one knew what was needed to be accomplished.
I looked at it in yu evil.
Namaki?
Because of you, I'm in a slut.
I want you to see it.
I can figure out things to bring you.
I don't like studying.
No one knows.
They want us to do it.
You live here?
Close all windows.
I want to go home.
I've had the morning of a lot of missions.
I threw away my glasses.
Some of the employees did not get used to the job.
What do you do here?
They're not happy.
They raise?
Use what is needed.
You don't want to know why?
He looks like his brother.
I listen to you.
Why aren't you with me?
I don't want your money.
It's the day!
I know what needs to be accomplished.
Mize I hurt my throat.
I've got schoolwork.
I knew you'd go there.
Don't go back!
Let me go buy a sandwich.
My daughter's gonna be led in the heaviest.
I know how to do it.
January is the previous month of the year.
I'm up to four o'clock.
I have to know.
Ishkola is sweet.
We meet there.
Don't have an ear for them.
I want to live with you.
Languages have complicated vocabulary.
In the past there was a church here.
We miss you too.
Who do you think I am?
Why don't you want to go?
You don't want to know what happened?
Why do you think that?
Why don't you try this goth? It's right with your pants.
My sister looks like Mama.
You can go there.
I want to see you.
It doesn't honor me.
Why don't you do it?
You have a sibling?
He's not a child.
I don't have any labs to read.
We're always playing at God's bottom.
"'Mpora mesquite mesquite' by hand".
This house is for me?
Why aren't you in class?
I think it's okay.
I don't know where I go.
I'm burning.
We learn French.
I want to see you.
How much time do you want to keep it?
He looks like his Father.
No one knows his name.
The window is closed.
Don't come back again.
It's a very good book.
This book is very good.
Go to the couch!
This bed is so sloppy.
I don't know.
It's all right, Timmy.
Listen to me.
You have to stop drinking.
Talk to me.
I couldn't cry.
He shaved his head.
I don't know.
He found the most expensive dress.
I just know his name.
He looks like your brother.
Stop looking at me.
It doesn't look like you.
I'm taking you with me.
It's all about travel?
I think it's perfect.
I'm not an idiot.
I'm here just because of you.
An Assyrian wants to see you.
Let me do what - a pants or a jipo?
I'm a college sweetheart.
She's slowly going so that a child can follow.
Room is good.
I won't let go.
I heard you stay for a few days.
I'm an Assyrian in college.
We go to the west.
If I heard it would make you laugh.
How's the door?
I like to come here.
Your room has two windows?
I've been working in this societé since last year.
They are extremely long.
I'll understand.
Why do you have this?
He did not read this book.
I live in Norway now.
I lay all day yesterday, because it was God's day.
What's your brother?
I've come to study.
I can't wash the dishes. There's a lack of water.
I'm on vacation.
He knows you love him?
I'm a 'baked smoke'.
It's my new car.
Get out of the car.
Well look how I do it!
I'm in the kitchen.
I would be interested to know your name.
You like it?
I know what's happening.
In the middle of what remains a fire broke out.
Don't drink it!
We don't have any money anymore.
How's the family doing?
Where do you learn?
I like what I do.
We don't have a car.
Say it again.
I'll make you happy.
I like to be here.
What do you look like?
He has a car.
Remember your kindness and forget the rest.
Don't force me to do it.
I have to see you.
Don't ask for money.
I know what they do.
You know what it looks like?
I'm glad he's alive you are.
Where you eat tonight I'm not safe.
You're kids.
They don't make you happy.
The bus stop is five minutes from here.
I think I'm welcome.
You're a good cook.
Let me have a taste for you.
What do you want?
Why do you ask me?
What's my watch?
Share it! Jools.
I saw him run.
Good question.
I like to read.
This girl's wearing herself like a guy.
I love you.
He found the most expensive dress.
Take off your shoes.
We don't know.
He loves her.
He's a good man.
It's interesting to me.
What's the matter with Mary?
Why are you asking me?
It's a good plan.
I'll rob you.
He doesn't look happy.
Forgive me so much!
You understand?
You're my friend.
What kind of books do you like to read?
He's not a child.
Why do you go?
I thought you'd come home.
"The factory that makes thousands of bottlenecks is a month".
It's so hot here.
I don't know these people.
You'll love him.
You're not coming, are you?
I'm doin' windows.
Why do I have to go.
OK, I'll take it from you.
I knew it would interest you.
Let me buy you a new one.
Ja hiyo!
You're ours.
Too big?
He loves her.
He likes to read novels.
Why don't you come in?
I don't know how long it takes.
Don't you know what a nest is?
Why don't you go with me?
Why do you ask?
Take what you want.
You'll love it.
He does not speak English.
The car's dead.
This wall is cold.
Why do you think so?
No one knows their names.
Take me.
What's your daddy?
I go to bed.
Can I use them?
Too tall?
You saw their eyes?
You know him?
They do not pay him on the moon but on the bottom.
All right, and you?
I'm a Chinese woman.
The owner of this car is my father.
Thank you!
She looks like her mother.
We know him.
Flowers and trees need fresh air and fresh water.
And I'm going to school here.
I'm here to kill you.
Tomorrow was five.
Nguyo!
We don't hear French.
We don't want to know.
I've got money for you.
I'm undercooked.
Don't come back again.
I understand what you're saying.
I know why you want it.
I think he's coming.
When Tom is there with you?
See how beautiful it is.
No, thank you.
What do you think?
He's not a child.
No one knows where we are.
It does not appeal to you.
It's ours.
He doesn't like us.
It will be very good.
He's a Frenchman.
You passed the red signal.
You want me to come?
I knew you were here.
Stop reading.
They say he's very rich.
I'm sure I've probably seen him.
What about this underside?
Your forehead's so hot. I'm sure you have influenza.
He understands her.
You're an Assyrian?
Good night!
I don't know where they are.
Why don't you come home?
I think I sat on it.
I was going to make you know.
My house is near the church.
I don't have my sister.
We're not told to talk about it right now.
I know.
I don't want this money.
What chef?
You can stay home.
Bring me two bucks.
This car looks like a new one.
When do you study?
The windows face south.
Don't give up!
And me.
Why aren't you at school?
This phone call is for you?
This phone call is for you?
We know.
The Father Is Home.
I don't know what you want.
Take one.
What's his family?
This idea was a bad one?
I'm on vacation.
You're sick, you have to rest.
Money left me alone.
The bananas look yellow.
No one else was there except me.
I said I was sad.
I know what I'm saying.
I was going to say that you can approach me.
My friend happened to you last week.
Take me home.
I'll find them.
We'll add to the lead.
He loved her.
What's your brother?
You're not coming, are you?
If he had stayed home to him, he would have no problems.
You don't look good.
That brought you here, Nico?
You'll love him.
I've seen him.
That's what I'm looking for.
Come on!
I'm not a nerd.
I'm doin' windows.
I don't like it.
My father is not home to me.
Don't go back!
You like it?
He's not there.
A guy jumps.
The school is over.
I'd do it again.
The money's gone.
We are university students.
I suspected.
I have to rest.
I think so too.
I'm taking you with me.
I've grown up with him.
Why is it so hateful?
I read this book.
I'm here to pick you up.
I think I'm welcome.
You know what you're supposed to do?
Give it to her.
You're all very good.
I think I'm welcome.
Take off your shoes.
I know you love me.
You're not my brother.
I'll look at that.
"This Under is God's Day".
I know.
I'll smell.
This damn is pretty good.
Welcome home!
We'll get rich.
You see this house? It's my house.
It's going away?
I'll do what you ask of me.
It's too long.
Let me see.
Thank you very much.
I need time to think.
I knew it made you happy.
That book I have, too.
What are you reading?
I speak three languages.
Where do you live?
"I'll cut 'em with 'em on the knife.
We don't know him.
Don't come back.
You know what?
We can start now?
He doesn't like us.
He likes to read novels.
Look what's right.
I don't need you.
There's a washing machine in the house?
God bless you!
I know where you live.
How much time will you spend?
Be sure to see this picture.
How do you feel about it?
I like math.
My neighbor is a carpenter.
Many trees fell.
You like it?
Go to the side!
You don't want why!
I respond.
It's what it's like.
Jana hiyo.
When he saw the blood the patient looked.
You know what they want?
What do you want to see?
I'll give you a book.
Where's he playing for?
I love you, too.
Not now, when?
I don't know where you live.
Why don't you get it?
Open the window.
Don't forget to ask more questions.
It's nine hours short of fifteen minutes.
We broke up.
I know you listen.
It's what makes me love you.
What do you know about what happened?
They'll know what they're doing.
We end up alone.
You know where it is?
We know.
I know how to get there.
What was your car?
In the night all the cats shoot.
This book is new.
There's no water in 'em anymore.
Sell me clothes on the line.
It's so hot, sco?
I know what needs to be done.
Nguyo!
I'm thinking of you.
You remember this game?
He's glad.
We don't have any money anymore.
I don't know what I want.
Thank you!
This one below is three.
You know?
Ask him his name.
They don't want to use them.
My dream has been the truth.
Where'd you come from?
I know you listen.
Well look where you go.
Don't forget to carry a letter.
He hears French.
I love her.
I suggest you read the notes below.
I'm not an Assyrian in college.
This knife is cool.
I listen to you.
I wonder about having time for another cup of coffee.
We love our park.
Why do you love me?
Don't look there.
I want you to read it.
Well look where you're going.
I was going to say that you can approach me.
It doesn't honor me.
This word comes from geek.
The owner of something is my brother.
Why do I have to do it?
Why aren't you here?
It's dead?
I know what needs to be done.
Don't forget to carry a letter.
You don't want to know this!
I know your mother.
The word doesn't taste good.
Find me what I want.
A tunic is made of silk.
I want a goose.
Where's my money?
Why do you ask?
You've got something in the mood, you want to get rid of yourself? You can tell me.
Thank you very much.
This girl's wearing herself like a guy.
I came to find you.
On God's days I'm not gonna.
Do good to those who hate you.
This word comes from geek.
This idea was a bad one?
Don't pick up a number.
My name is John.
You understand what's written here?
I have my brothers.
You know the owner of this car?
I'm not going to quit.
He's learning.
You want me to paint you on your hungers?
It's Saturday.
I need three-quarters of staff.
He had no more money.
It's not about money.
We don't know him.
Don't leave me.
You can leave it English.
Get out of my bed!
I understand.
It's supposed to stop.
My father loves me.
I don't want to get rich.
I have money.
My pants have been soaked.
This beer's a bad one?
I know these people.
I don't have a place to live.
We broke up.
They don't come this below.
What do we want from you?
What?
I am assigned to learn French.
How's your sister doing?
I don't want to get sick.
He's very interested in his new bike.
A good one that pleases people more than beauty?
Don't you understand?
I'm here to say goodbye.
