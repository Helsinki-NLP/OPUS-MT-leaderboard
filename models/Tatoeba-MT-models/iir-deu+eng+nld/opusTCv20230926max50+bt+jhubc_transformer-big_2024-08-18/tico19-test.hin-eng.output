The rapidly growing cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom which confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly across all countries, taking place at different stages depending on the country.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a rapid rise in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a group of unknown diagnosing-science pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China reported the novel coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as pathogenic.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, that is, respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia and most of these recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops as a more serious disease requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% of cases have an overview of severe care.
The fatality rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assess the cumulative prevalence trend of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases to Italy in the EU/EEA countries and the UK during January 31 - March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 further expanded geographically and currently the activity in the rest of the world of the COVID-19 pandemic moved from this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The first European confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported according to the WHO case definition in the 5th edition of EuroServation 2020, Spitri et al..
In the EU/EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases of people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on January 24, 2020.
As of March 15, 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) have reported COVID-19 cases, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone and 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between December 31, 2019 and that date.
Achieving cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, the National and Regional Health Authority and the World Health Organization reported COVID-19 cases are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the proliferation of active COVID-19 cases, we thus calculated a brief cumulative prevalence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases taking into account the natural process of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period January 1 - March 15, 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of reported cases in each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. as compared to Italy in the period January 31 - March 15, 2020.
The trend of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of a brief cumulative prevalence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the entire UK, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21 and rose sharply around February 28, 2020.
This was mainly due to a sharp increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but a similar growing trend was observed in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases compared to Italy in EU/EEA countries and the UK in the period January 31 - March 15, 2020.
This specifically shows that by March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported the total number of comparable cases from Italy cases only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparative pace in all countries.
This is despite differences in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for choosing patients who should be screened for COVID-19 confirmation, including holding and testing.
In early March 2020, physicians in Italy's affected areas reported a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
The figures for hospitalization of COVID-19 cases and/or intensive care units are currently only available at the EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% cases respectively (the figures are not shown).
They, however, must be collected in a versed manner to supplement the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The 2010-11 study saw a significant difference in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal per 100,000 population.
This means countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases at 90% risk for each EU/EEA country and UK with estimates for the health care capacity saturation is modeled in the sixth update of the ECDC’s acute risk assessment on COVID-19.
As cases so far remain flocked to EU/EEA countries and some areas of the UK and hospitals and intensive care units serve the commonly defined regional public, information about cases and intensive care beds should be made available primarily at the Nomenclature of Territorial Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience gained from Italy and the current trend in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for the continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is taking place in the affected areas of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC’s acute risk assessment, with a change in approach to mitigation from limiting, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is needed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, because if not implemented over time, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may be sufficient to provide adequate time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and respond accordingly.
The acute risk assessment also lists public health measures in addressing the impact of the pandemic.
To slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, countries have very few opportunities to further increase their control efforts and reduce pressure on health care.
If it fails, it is very likely that the health care systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a rapid surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed more than 3,000 people due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere around the world, resulting in disaster for humans.
Like its homogeneous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in 2003 among thousands of people, SARS-CoV-2 may also have been transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms by the baggage mechanism.
Although COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, it is much more transmissible and affects older men and women more than young people.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics on epidemiology, for-science, virology, diagnosis, treatment, forecasting and prevention of disease.
While there are still a lot of questions to be answered, we hope this review will help in understanding and eliminating the deadly disease.
Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unexpected and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were requested to stay at home for a full holiday and several weeks thereafter due to the outbreak of Novel Viral Disease.
The virus is much more similar to the coronavirus that caused the outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 and the associated disease was named COVID-19.
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to the whole country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 deaths due to the virus.
The WHO has warned that COVID-19 is the "enemy of the people" and possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months after the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 accounts have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, for-science, diagnosis, and treatment, which has resulted in the sequencing of the virus by isolate from many patients.
This review seeks to present the essence of research progress on new and rapidly evolving subject areas.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19's SARS and other diseases caused by CoVs, to Middle East respiratory syndrome (the outbreak in MERS, 2012).
We will also discuss the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some of the most important questions we have learned so far.
CoVs have been traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens for humans with mainly generating about 15% of the common cold 4 colds.
However, in this century we have faced highly pathogenic human CoVs twice, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible unhappiness and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Figure 1, the herd of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, was first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the sequence of CoVs was released.
The first fatal case was reported from Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
During this time, the pandemic rapidly spread to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infections were reported in health care providers, which indicated that human transmission from humans was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all its public traffic shutting down.
The first clinical study on the disease on January 24 reported that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health disaster.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation is increasing rapidly, the final magnitude and intensity of the outbreak are yet to be determined.
A multi-center study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients on 11 February 2020 presented a more up-to-date picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
People of all ages were infected with SARS-CoV-2, but mainly between the ages of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected individuals were over the age of 50, very few under the age of 20 and only 14 infected persons under the age of 10.
Males (0.31/100,000) were more infected than women (0.27/100,000) from SARS-CoV-2.
COVID-19 spread mainly in and around the herds in Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9 days) from the beginning to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to finish was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original fertility number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people rose sharply before January 23, 2020, which corresponds to widespread traffic before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a sub-family of single-stranded RNA viruses.
They can be divided into four generations, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The casing nozzle (S) in glycoprotein, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, connects to its cellular propulsive angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) and then merges the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cellular mass; after the replication of the viral genome, the cover forms the genomic RNA virions with glycoproteins and nucleocapsidad proteins, which later merge into the plasma membrane for the release of the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of beta-CoV, with more than 99.98% genetic similarity found in 10 sequential samples collected from Wuhan's Hunan seafood market, the original location of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in super-fine sections of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2, SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV, were found to be predominant.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 connects to human ACE2 with a greater weakness than SARS-CoV which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2, produces a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
The novel small protein coded by SARS-CoV-2, orf3b, and secreted protein coded by orf8 can also form.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play a role in viral pathologies and block the expression of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 has no known functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in a mixture with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which had free and closed compositions, was compiled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could combine two S proteins that provide evidence for the identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1, SARS-CoV-2 may become a medical target for drug testing to suppress infection.
Basic and Intermediate Nutrients
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans by a civet cat and camel respectively.
By caste comparison with other CoVs of SARS-CoV-2, bats were considered to be the basic nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, which intermediate nutrient has helped to infect humans by crossing the virus' species barrier is unknown and the transmission route is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed the snake as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans that included similar recombination with S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that pangolin - often with a long muzzle used in traditional Chinese medicine, ant-eating mammals have a potential intermediate nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity found in SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin.
However, the prevalence of a difference of 1% in both genomes throughout is still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are awaited for solid evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 5 days in artificial ambient dry environments with less than 48 hours and less than 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and at 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2, at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes and is sensitive to ultraviolet rays; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, parasitic acids, chloroform and other fat solvents can effectively neutralize the virus, but not chloroxide.
The entire human population generally lacks resistance to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4.4).
In general, after the virus enters the nutrient, it is the first time C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) of the immune system.
Through various pathways, the manifestation of virus reproducing factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferon (IFNs) stimulates the spread of the virus and accelerates the macrophages of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus in avoiding immune responses.
Soon, the optimized immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B> T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
T assistive cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can block T cell functions by killing T cells.
Triclosan resistance, including supplements and immunities such as C3a and C5a, is also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from the recovered patient deactivated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive response to the immune system generates a very large number of locally free particles that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and also multifunctional failure and death in the worst conditions.
Older people and pregnant women with sympathies of SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by the onset in the herd are more likely to be affected.
It is common that people who are exposed to a greater number of viruses or whose immune functions are combined are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study based on the demographics of 8,866 cases found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period and thus preventing infected but symptomless people from transmitting the virus to other people is very important for health authorities.
As a general practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus usually require 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a major and early symptom of COVID-19 with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced breathing difficulty and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients experienced a rapid increase in the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity and cogulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and pulmonary imaging abnormalities should also be screened for the virus for premature diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for breathing difficulty and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of the herd generated by transmission from the family herd and the symptomless person.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and breathing difficulty (55%) as the main symptom.
However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them needed ventilation support and this is in line with the higher fatality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also seen in patients with MERS.
SARS patients observed that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), breathing difficulty (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and about 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
The COVID-19 death rate was 2% as of February 14, when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
By comparison, the mortality rate of SARS as of November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases based on a June 2012 demographic study.
Earlier studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 had a R0 of 5.71-7.23 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 6.47 higher than SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with regard to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data indicates that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less deadly than both of the latter.
Therefore, controlling the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The herd usually begins with a single family or a group of people or a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence or contact with infected persons or patients in Wuhan or other affected areas within the last two weeks from the beginning.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients discharged from the hospital can re-convene the virus, which warns of extending the quarantine time.
The number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in patients in the early stages is normal or low.
For example, white blood cell count including lymphatic cell count 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L &lt; lymphopenia with 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L and increased aspartate aminotransferase levels and virology were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin increased in the blood of some patients and increased C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, a product of the fibrin collapse present in the blood, the level of D-dimer, was increased and the lymphatic cell count continued to decline.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by bilateral macular images or ground glass ambiguities in the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, gas exchange is seriously compromised due to uncontrolled inflammation, substance accumulation and progressive fibrosis.
The action of type-I and type-II pneumocyte decreases the active levels and increases surface stress and thus reduces the lungs' ability to flower and increases the risk of lung function stopping.
Therefore, the worst findings of chest radiography are often parallel to the most serious condition of the disease.
The first pathological analysis on COVID-19 on February 18, 2020 saw the viscosity of pneumocyte in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, the formation of haeline membranes and the porous leakage of lymphatic cells, and multicellular multicellular polycentric cells that were identical to the pathology and ARDS of viral infection and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate that could accelerate the pandemic, clinical manifestations began to be used to diagnose in China on 13 February 2020 (which was no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR).
The same situation happened with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is necessary and necessary to make an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zheng Group described a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which is 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L without the need for any elaborate equipment, from 200 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L (Artificial per 10 mol/L at 10 <0xC3><0x97> 2 <0xC3><0x97> RNA per microliter per input)
If the clinical samples are verified, there is hope that the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoVs, physicians can provide primarily supportive care to COVID-19 patients with the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases previously used or attempted various therapies proposed (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, anti-inflammatorys, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma from recovered patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Drug companies are struggling to develop vaccines and vaccines that are immune to the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lungs primarily initially and possibly also on other organs in the lower range, which express ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Yet, respiratory dysfunction and failure remain a major threat to patients and are the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is important to relieve symptoms and save lives and it includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-intrusive ventilation and entrance mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be assisted by the modified heart-pulmonary subway technique used in the treatment of extremities, life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
At the same time, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting the function of vital organs are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm occurs as a result of excessive response of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine Storm TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1 are the types of systemic stimulants characterized by the release of cytokine chain.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the leading causes of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunization is necessary in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumabs, IL6-anti-monoclonal antibodies, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storms.
Changes in T cell-directed immune response in other immune treatments for cytokine storms; blockade of IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; JAK blocking; suppression of Blinatomob; suppression of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immune repressive, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects while dramatically affecting disease-prone, especially non-vascular osteoarthritis.
Nevertheless, short-term procedures of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses are recommended to be used carefully in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
As of the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue given in the vein has been found to be effective in an American patient of COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malburg viruses initially.
Later, Remdesivir also showed possible inhibition of other aperture RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has made the compound available to China to carry out two tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are quite expected.
Also, baricitinib, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, iopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Joint therapy with Iopinavir/Ritonavir can lead to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
Interactions with other drugs used in patients of these treatments should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and Immune Production from Recovered Patients
There has been a long history of aggregation of blood from patients recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from being infected.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients has a high level of immunization relative to the pathogen.
The antibodies produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other external substances are immunoglobulin (IG) and they identify unique molecules in the pathogen and inactivate them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours with low prednisone and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, unless specific therapies are developed, verification and clarification are required to propose the method to be used on a large scale.
Also, despite the therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages related to plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antidepressants can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine ejaculation syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening poisoning.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for treating critically ill patients.
It's hard to develop and produce specific antibodies so fast to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to segregate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that codes effective antibodies or check for effective antibodies to the virus' essential proteins.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend primarily on the combination of different components in a different formula based on the diagnosis of a disease based on the TCM principles.
Most effective components are still unknown or meaningless because it is difficult to remove and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from severe stages due to a lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, <0x58>u Feng Jie do capsules and <0x58>ian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
In 87% of patients using TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), ninxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), the highest recovery rates were seen in the treatment of COVID-19 in many provinces of China, while Hubei Province where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, the recovery rate was minimal (13%).
However, this is a fairly thick comparison because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Bid Zheng and colleagues published studies to compare only Western Medicine (WM) treatment and joint treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the body temperature in the WM<0x2B>TCM group was significantly lower than just the WM group's time needed to be normal, to go for symptoms, and to be hospitalized.
The most impressive, only the WM<0x2B>TCM group’s symptomatic poorer rate (lightly severe) than the WM group was significantly lower (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group only (8.8% versus 39%).
Still, the efficacy and safety of TCM is still waiting for more controlled tests in more centers at a larger level.
It will also be interesting to identify the system of actions and clarify effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients experience a lot of fear from highly contagious and deadly disease and quarantined people also experience monotony, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, low-oxidation, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more restlessness and mental agony.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychological diseases were reported, including constant stress, restlessness, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, mental symptoms, prolapse, even suicide.
Finding mandatory contacts and quarantines as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak can make people more restless and glistening about the effects of stigma on touch, quarantine, and their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and individuals who come in contact with them as well as to the general public.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with constant and accurate updates about the outbreak and treatment plans of SARS-CoV-2, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for disrupting transmission of sensitive nutrients from animal funds and infected humans and are often supplemented by antiviral treatment in the control of the pandemic due to growing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and potent inertia and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
The live-animal vaccines have been evaluated in SARS-animal models.
However, the efficacy and safety of these candidate vaccines in elderly people and in fatally challenging variants are still to be determined before the start of any clinical study.
This is probably because SARS gradually ended 17 years ago and since then no new cases have been reported.
In contrast, sporadic cases and swarms of MERS continue to arise in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in the epidemiological areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using sub-units of inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant proteins and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for individuals with non-resistance capabilities is an essential and critical task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome difficulty due to the long-term need (average 18 months) and dynamic variations of CoVs in the development of vaccines.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to reveal its entire clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without the symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also related to high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for health-care agencies to create disease-prone replicas to determine the priority of their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on reported clinical studies so far, the following factors may affect or relate to the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the age group of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% of patients were over the age of 50, as described above.
Patients who require intensive care were more likely to have underlying complications and complications and were significantly older than those who did not need them (at the median age of 51 versus 66), which indicates age as a predictive factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: More men have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Sympathies and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also connect to ACE2-positive collagengiocytes that can cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease have deep correlations and can interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood show the severity or tissue damage of the donor and it has been proposed as a possible predictor factor for disease, response to therapy and finally recovery.
The CRP level correlates with the severity of COVID-19 and disease-prone has also been proposed.
At the same time, increased lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartite aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help in predicting results.
These enzymes are widely manifested in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are free during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver diseases.
Major clinical symptoms: The topical progression of chest radiography and clinical symptoms with other problems should be considered for forecasting the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immune-resistant commonly used as conjunctivitis in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of donor damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroid were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from non-vascular osteoarthritis with a lifetime disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used in low doses and in COVID-19 patients for the short term.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress during the outbreak of COVID-19, as they often witnessed the long period of quarantine and the death of six and near family members and fellow patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these people get out of stress and return to normal life.
So far, according to demographic studies, epidemiological characteristics differ from SARS of COVID-19 appear.
Along with replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and do not produce mild or any symptoms in the early stages of infection, like other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, infected patients can generate large amounts of the virus during daily activities at the initial stage or incubation period with a lot of difficulty in controlling the pandemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to have occurred when patients were too sick, while most transmissions did not occur during the initial stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
With the hope of disrupting transmission of SARS-CoV-2, huge efforts are currently underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities and continued quarantine of almost the entire public.
While these steps are dramatically destroying the economy and other areas of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which indicates the ups and downs of the pandemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the upswing phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19 which appears to be far more contagious than SARS will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set the pattern to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 recovered and has been identified in both the mid-turbinet and throat phasing of patients who had gone to the hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that the new virus, identified, could become a recurring case of influenza.
However, there have been promising signs from China based on the low number of new cases, which indicate that current strategies may be working.
It was initially predicted to have a million cases with Ebola's half a million deaths.
However, by strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 weakens in infectiousness and eventually ends or becomes a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
The comparison between SARS and MERS of the COVID-19 pandemic is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing and also by direct contact with potentially virus-contaminated materials.
The virus was also found in stools, which also creates a new possibility of oral transmission from the stool.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with other disease and 40 health care providers, were likely caused by medical infections.
Therefore, great care should also be taken to protect people or infected people standing next to humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers and patients in contact.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series <0x23>1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid droplets from potentially infected person from moving into the air or sticking to the surface of things from where they can go to others.
However, only N95 (Series <0x23>1860s) masks can prevent as little as 10 to 80 nm from entering the breath; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can also cross five surgical masks placed on top of one, health care providers with direct contact with patients must necessarily wear N95 (Series <0x23>1860s) masks, as well as surgical masks.
Along with masks, health care providers should wear isolate gowns that fit to further reduce contact with viruses.
The virus can also infect a person with the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he wore an N95 mask; the virus may have entered the body with his subcutaneous eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face coverings or glasses while working with patients.
In affected or potentially affected areas, the general public is strongly advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and possibly limit contact with infected individuals.
It is considered to be a reasonable distance of three feet for people to stay away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, as reported on January 7, 2020, due to the extreme similarity to SARS-CoV it may have caused China to be highly wary based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the Director of Wuhan's Centers for Disease Control consoled citizens by saying that the novel virus has low transmissibility and limited fertility in human-to-human and there is no problem in preventing and limiting the disease.
This message freed the public from a lot of fear, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and it was time to limit the disease to the minimum level in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China can learn a lot from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must be careful enough when making public announcements (1) because every word matters to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) to continue to improve the response from clinics rather than waiting for formal information from physicians or authorities to be more sensitive and responsive to the system of exposure to abnormal information; (3) to be aware of the public rather than attempting to console the public; and to limit the potential pandemic to an early stage; and
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and about 50 other countries around the world by the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are also similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has made the perception of SARS occurring again and again.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to limit the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects men more than older people and women, and the severity and mortality in the elderly are also higher than young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomless while SARS patients often do so when they are critically ill, which creates much more difficulty in limiting the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may again be positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, many serious cases remain to be resolved, which are as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still can't come to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
What kind of animal was the intermediate species in the transmission of the virus from bats to humans?
Without finding an answer to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we can’t effectively stop broadcasting and there can be ever a recurrence of the outbreak.
Although molecular imaging and biochemical tests have seen that SARS-CoV-2 connects to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and then make pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2-individual cells to other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during transmission in humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, gradually ending like SARS, or will it continue to happen periodically like the flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever price we have to pay, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normalcy.
Animal origin of the human coronavirus.
Mutations and adaptations have led to the simultaneous development of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their nutrients (including humans) over thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) that caused mild disease such as colds were known.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) completely reversed the situation, demonstrating the destructive and fatal nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has again brought the CoVs to light and has shocked us with a more contagious capacity but reduced pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and we will work to understand the zoonotic origin of HCoVs.
Most HCoVs originate from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
There is also information about some HCoVs intermediate cough nutrients.
The identification of animal nutrients has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Checking the interactions of CoV-entrepreneurs in animals can also give a significant insight into the pathogenity of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current information about the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of the discovery as well as the zoonotic origin and interethnic transmission.
Importantly, we compare and see different HCoVs from the point of view of the gradual development of viruses and gene recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this perspective.
At the same time, the need to successfully replace the nutrients and the implications of the gradual development of the virus on the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.
The coronaviruses are from the coronavirus family, which includes groups of invasive, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses shelter the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilograms in RNA viruses were named "CoVs" due to crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have unbroken genomes that have the same structure.
Nearly two-thirds of the genomes contain two large overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab repliques polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins called nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spikes (S), invelopes (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Many hereditary-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by different hereditary genes of CoVs.
Based on the variation in protein sequences, CoVs are divided into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), of which beta-CoVs are mostly HCoVs and have been subdivided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Caste evidence has observed that bats and moustaches are mostly gene sources of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the dominant ones of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently exceeded species barriers and have emerged as some important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms like cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, with a greater likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hyperpulmonary manifestations generating severe lower respiratory tract infections in more patients.
The first HCoV-229E breed, B814, was isolated from the nasal flow of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information was gathered by a detailed study about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept was widely accepted until the outbreak of SARS that the infection of HCoVs is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003, infecting more than 8,000 people with a mortality rate of about 10% of untreated cases, is one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak caused a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread elsewhere in the world.
The 2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is a factor agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to which 3,120 people have lost their lives and more than 91,000 people have been infected as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell is ringing and the world is set to prepare for the upcoming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All the seven HCoVs are native to bats, rats or domestic animals.
Many evidence supports gradual development from bats of all HCoVs, in which viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but show extreme genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Detection of the zoonotic source of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, motivating power and bonding factors of the species.
It can guide or facilitate the discovery of SARS-CoV-2’s cache, intermediate and amplifying zoonotic nutrients(s) with a significant effect in preventing future spread.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origin, interethnic transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the ancestral viruses of HCoVs are non-pathogenic in their natural vapour nutrients, but become pathogenic after inter-ethnic transmission into the new nutrient.
We will also review the trend of gradual development of HCoVs in which an increase in infectiousness is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this perspective.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
The first of the HCoV-229E breeds first isolated from the nasal flow of infected common cold patients, different CoVs were isolated from many infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the last decade.
A brief summary of the chronology of the history of the discovery of HCoV (table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first breed of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the year 1966, which later adapted to grow into WI-38 lung veins.
In patients infected with HCoV-229E, 10<0x7E>20% of cases with fever and cough showed cold symptoms including headache, sneezing, discomfort and sore throat.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was sequentially isolated in the brain of milk-drinking rats and by organ enrichment.
The clinical features of the HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to the infection produced by HCoV-229E that is symptomatic of infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world and are likely to be transmitted prominently during the winter season with the cold weather.
Usually, the period of gradual development of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2-week illness.
According to a study by human volunteers, mild cold developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
Infection of severe lower respiratory tract appears in only a few patients who are incapable of immunity.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia," was the first well-documented HCoV epidemic in human history and the third factor to be discovered is the HCoV, SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS can be identified in late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
SARS has reported 8,096 cases with 774 deaths, with the pandemic spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to the most prevalence, it was estimated that with a gradual development period of 4 to 7 days and the maximum viral bearing appearing on the 10th day of the disease, about two secondary cases could increase due to each case.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show symptoms such as muscle pain, headaches, twitching, restlessness, and coldness, followed by breathing pains, coughing, and respiratory distress as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, ovarian liver function checks and increased creatine kinases are common abnormalities related to SARS' laboratory.
Airborne airborne damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increase in macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require later intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, with usually cytokine storms, can also be infected in these severe cases, which can be especially fatal to patients with incompetence.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy related to an indicator patient who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of efforts have been made in researching HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old baby at the end of 2004 in the Netherlands.
Initially, it was found to be spread among disabled patients with small children, elderly and respiratory diseases.
Diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 are common to appear colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchitis.
In another independent study, the same virus was described separating from the nose sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases are caused by HCoV-NL63 and its extreme occurrence occurs during early summer, spring and cold seasons.
HCoV-NL63 is related to obstructive larynx, also known as cramps.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from the 71-year-old male who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis from the community, it was also reported to be related to severe asthma screening of HCoV-HKU1.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found all over the world, generating mild respiratory diseases.
All these four community-accompanied HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are usually less likely to mutate to produce highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown reasons such as the rare case of a more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently resulted in severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs gain the ability to communicate efficiently and sustain themselves in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia, with acute pneumonia and kidney failure developing.
While most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, sometimes imported cases with secondary proliferation in close relatives have been reported in many European countries and Tunisia.
The second secondary outbreak occurred in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases in South Korea.
The clinical manifestations of MERS, characterized by progressive severe pneumonia, correspond to SARS.
Unlike SARS, acute kidney failure also develops in many patients with MERS, which has so far been observed only in MERS in diseases caused by HCoVs.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
From mid-December 2019, swarms of pneumonia patients related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 an international public health emergency and named the disease as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with the death rate of untreated cases of 3.4%.
Notably, the case fatality rate in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which appear as bukhar, cough and respiratory distress.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can grow as fast as acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they come in different branches of the race.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Compared to the other six HCoVs of SARS-CoV-2, there have been very interesting similarities and variations.
First, the gestation period of the HCoV disease and the duration of the procedure are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to those of SARS-CoV and HCoVs acquired from four communities (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are usually seen during infection with HCoVs acquired from the community, including non-specific, mild or without any symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as in the case of infection with SARS-CoV, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also features both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the infectiousness of HCoVs obtained from the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after humans move forward, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether the rectum-oriented transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in at least some conditions, like SARS-CoV, remains to be clarified by future studies.
It's also particularly interesting to see if the SARS-CoV-2 community can behave seasonally like cases of HCoVs.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including infectiousness, pathogenicity and continued spread, will be effective on the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
HCoVs, acquired from all four communities that produce mild symptoms, have been well adapted in humans.
From the second point of view, it may also be correct that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can survive ancient HCoV epidemics.
The HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and the humans who develop severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
To do this, the accumulation of optimized mutations that prevent nutrient restriction factors will have to replicate HCoVs in humans in a sufficient range.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and infects more people, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult for humans to prevent its transmission from quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired CoVs have been transmitting to the human population, generating colds in immune patients.
These viruses do not need animal cells.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted in humans and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
They need to remain and spread in their zoonotic cells and possibly find a chance to be transmitted to receptive human targets by one or more intermediate and growing nutrients.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those of both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least in the present time it is very contagious like the HCoVs obtained from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and transmitted to humans without any cell or intermediate animal nutrients.
Before we discuss the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be of great help to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the gradual development, natural, coax, intermediate and enhancing nutrients of HCoVs.
An animal is a nutrient with a gradual development of HCoV, if it shelters a very close ancestor with a high similarity sharing at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this nutrient.
In the same way, the cell nutrients shelter HCoV continuously and for a long time.
In both conditions, the nutrients become naturally infected and are the natural nutrients of the HCoV or its ancestral virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV enters a new intermediate nutrient just before or around humans, it is not well adapted to the new nutrient and is often pathogenic.
It can act as a zoonotic source of intermediate nutrients human infection and can play the role of a nutrient enhancing by temporarily replicating the virus and then transmitting it to humans to increase the level of infection.
If an HCoV cannot maintain its transmission within the intermediate nutrient, it can go into an end-infection.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate nutrients and maintain locality for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate nutrient becomes the natural cosh nutrient.
Epidemiological data showed retrospectively that the indicator case of SARS had a history of contact with game animals.
Later seroprevalence checks indicated that there was a greater prevalence of SARS-CoV-infectious IgG among animal traders than the general public.
Masked palm civets (paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in living animal markets were identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all the seavets of the markets were killed.
However, it has been reported that most of the masked palm seaweets in the wild or fields that do not come into contact with the living animal markets were negative SARS-CoV, which makes it possible that the masked sail sewage can only be as severe as the middle-enhancing nutrient and not as the natural vial of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the markets in Guangzhou are anti-SARS-CoV-resistant in various animals, these possibilities cannot be ruled out that many species of small mammals can also be intermediate-enhancing nutrients of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the last nutrient of SARS-CoV.
The follow-up discovery of the natural animal nutrient of SARS-CoV revealed a very close bat CoV named SARS-related rhinolofoss bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese Horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV-anti-immune antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with CoVs, SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the nutrients of the emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS such as CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats but none other than WIV1 have been isolated as a living virus.
Human angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the recipient of SARS-CoV.
The WIV1 extracted from samples of bat stools was exhibited to use bats, seawets and human ACE2 as a receptacle for cellular penetration.
Interestingly, the serum of healthy SARS patients was able to disable WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite the greater similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the closest ancestral virus to SARS-CoV and bats are not the closest tissue nutrient to SARS-CoV.
Racial analysis grouped MERS-CoV into a group similar to bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
The bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same nutrient receptor, dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) for virus entry.
The RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are racially closer to the bat beta-CoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not even be the closest tissue nutrient to MERS-CoV.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have found that in many African countries, rugged camels like camels of Middle East origin are seropositive towards MERS-CoV-specific inactivation antibodies.
Surviving MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal veins of humid camels, which shows that camels are authentic veins of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV were commonly seen with mild symptoms but with very high virus clearance.
Notably, infected camels extract viruses not only from the respiratory tract but also from the feces-faced route, which is also the main route for the virus's evacuation from bats.
However, questions still remain as there is no history of contact with camels before the onset of the symptoms of many confirmed cases of MERS, possibly due to human transmission or an unknown transmission route that includes the species of animals sheltering MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity to SARS-CoV-2 96.2% from bats separated from bats belonging to rhinologous species.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is enough to determine the ancestral relationship.
That is, bats may not be the closest cell nutrient to SARS-CoV-2, unless they are found almost identical bat CoVs in the future.
Possibly, the intermediate animal nutrient Huanan of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed in the wholesale market of seafood from which many early cases of COVID-19 were linked to indicators of human transmission phenomenon from potential animals.
A number of recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolin (Manis javanica) may also shelter ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolins share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with the genome SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are in two subspecies of SARS-CoV-2-equal viruses in the caste lineage, one of which shares a more similar receptive binding zone (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very diverse despite the gene-wide more sequential similarities.
The earlier study of the diseased pangolin also reported the discovery of a group of viral overlapping DNA from lung samples, which was similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted several different amalgamated methods and manual curation to produce a partial genome sequence with a full length viral genome of 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence in support of the direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence diversity between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The path to gradual development of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
Where RBDs have been found to have the highest sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome-wide sequence similarity.
It is a very hypothetical idea that the extreme similarity between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is selectively caused by the gradual development of intermediary circulation.
An alternative proposal is in favor of recombination between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As the driving force of gradual development, recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The closest zoonotic origin to SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Caste evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in Molecular.
It has been reported that the bat CoV, named ARCOV.2 (Applechain Ridge CoV), found in North American three-color bats, saw a close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, another bat named HCoV-229E Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 was genetically related to CoV, which was found in Ghana, although Camelid is also its suspected intermediate nutrient.
For clarity, the current information on the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Caste analysis has provided evidence of interethnic transmission events of HCoVs in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infections was observed.
The history of interethnic transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
The bat alpha-CoVs have been found close to HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha-CoV between them.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, humans and not Alpaca have been exposed to bats in a shared ecological habitat.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV bats, while Alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that Alpaca receives HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be denied.
In fact, bats are a direct source of rabies viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses, and Hendra viruses.
So it's no surprise that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bat alpha-CoVs are the gene pools of HCoV-229E, alpaca and hump camels can be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just like in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interracial transmission from bats to humming camels and humming camels to humans.
The gradual development of MERS-CoV from bats is known on its primary identification and has been further strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich range of virus species for interracial exchange and interethnic transmission of genetic fractions.
Long-life, dense settlements, near-social interaction and extreme ability to fly are favorable conditions for all bats to be the ideal "virus broadcasters."
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been entering rough camels for several decades.
It has adapted well into these camels that have turned from intermediate nutrients to stable and natural cosh nutrients.
MERS-CoV produces very mild diseases and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
It has a sporadic transmission accident in humans and humans remain the last nutrient of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be maintained.
Unlike the role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolin in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are much more pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the last nutrient of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs like civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities of interethnic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans are to be accepted or refuted in future studies.
First, bats can be nearly as nutritious as SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans can share ecological habitats with bats by killing or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate-enhancing nutrients in which SARS-CoV-2-related viruses had newly entered.
Humans are infected with the virus by killing and consuming game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, may be receptive to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of immunities in domestic and wild animals is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in the third species that are in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
In addition to a variety of animal nutrients, the three major factors in relation to viral are also important in easily crossing the species barriers of CoV.
First, their relatively higher mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoV can be considered "high" from "middle" with an average replacement rate of <0x7E>10-4 replacement per site per year depending on the stage of CoV adaptation in the new nutrient.
CoVs contain proof-reading exoribuncles, whose extinction can also lead to extreme variability and attenuation or loss of life potential.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is thought to be suppressing the replica of CoV by this exorbitant anaerobicliase and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the mutation rate of CoVs is one million times higher than their nutrients.
Also, the mutation rate is often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly low, pointing to a higher level of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps, it has already adapted to another nutrient closer to humans.
With SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV that has been well adapted to hump camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the genetic flow will rapidly deactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger RNA genome in CoV puts additional plasticity on genome changes for mutation and recombination, increasing the likelihood of interethnic co-curricular development, which is beneficial for the emergence of Novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by abundant open reading frames and coded protein functions at the 3rd end of the genome.
Thirdly, CoVs change randomly repeated patterns during RNA replication through the unique “copy-choice” mechanism.
In a nutrient that acts as a mixture character, fibrous changes often occur during CoV RNA transcription.
Extremely similar full-length and subgenomic RNAs can recombine and generate new CoVs.
Caste evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Interaction of virus-protective in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the nutritional customer is another important factor affecting interracial transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive choice during interethnic transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of the divergences between human and seawet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV with mutations on the RBD of S protein in particular is thought to be rapidly adapting to various nutrients.
Usually, the RBD in a CoV's S protein interacts with the cellular recipient and is chosen by the nutrient immune response with intensification.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 segment that connects with human ACE2 as well as its co-clients for viral penetration.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize ACE2 clients of various animals, including bats, seawets, rats, and raccoons, causing interracial transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were seen in RBD separate from human and seawet viral isolated and 4 of them are located in customer-binding parenthesis for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The RBD of Seawet SARS-CoV contains K479N and S487T mutations that can increase the attractiveness of the interaction of spike proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid replacements can be important in the adaptation of the viral in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that its S protein’s bond parity with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, the Cryo-EM study indicates 10 to 20 times more attractiveness of this pair than the addition between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine if another co-customer will be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also connects to ACE2, but from a different part of S.
Many other HCoV receptors exist, such as aminoepeptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylized silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after interracial transmission from their animal poachers.
The result of interethnic transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other nutrient dependencies and restriction factors, in addition to cellular receptors.
The variation of these nutrient proteins between humans and the natural cosh nutrients of HCoVs, such as bats, cockroaches camels, and mucus, can be a barrier to interethnic transmission.
The successful interethnic transmission of HCoVs has to strike the nutrient dependency factors and reverse the nutrient restriction factors.
In this regard, it is yet to identify and describe the molecular determinants in this critical area of virus-prone interaction.
A non-partisan genome-wide investigation of the nutrient dependence and restriction factors of SARS-CoV-2 can be fruitful using the latest technology of CRISPR.
The Emergence of Novel HCoVs: Return to the Basics
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bats act as a gene cell of CoVs, HCoVs.
At the same time, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also cause the development of HCoVs and work two important stages in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of the novel protein-coding gene has the potential to change viral synonyms too much.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but they were found to code various ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide extinction of SARS-CoVs has been characterized by isolated breeds at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptation mutation that promotes the change of cells.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a potential recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs ancestry, identifying a very large number of small recombination areas in RNA-based RNA polymerases.
Recombination locations were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
In the same way, it has been observed that the pandemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different hereditary populations, which occurred in humming camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be borne in mind that artificial elections can make non-irritating changes to the viral genome, possibly due to the viruses free from election pressure, such as by the nutrient immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype breed due to two-nucleotide deletion.
While the axiom ORF4 can be seen in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, Alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, causing frameshift.
Finally but not less important, the gradual development of Novel HCoVs is also caused by the pressure of choice in its cell nutrients.
The symptomless or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs that indicate mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seems that bats have been well adapted to CoVs structurally and physically.
For example, defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathogenicity generated by CoVs.
Additionally, the inhibitive natural malignant cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the regulation of NKG2/CD94 and the low manifestation level of major tissue conformation complex I molecules.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from more metabolic activity of bats can lead to suppression of CoV replication and affect proof readings by exoribonnuclease, thus providing selection pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus breeds when entering the new nutrient.
More pathogenic CoV breeds may also develop through recombination, which can lead to new protein or protein characteristics for nutrient adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic in tissue nutrients such as bats and camels or cause mild symptoms.
They react strongly without showing strong nutrient-resistant reactions.
It hides the reason why symptomless carriers are seen and what causes serious cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms, mainly due to the hyperactivity of the immune response and cytokine storm, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe lung damage.
In contrast, in symptomless carriers, the immune response is separated from the CoV replication.
The same strategy of separating the immune response can have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon reaction is particularly fast in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in humans should be at least beneficial in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, the NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is faulty.
From this argument, the inhibition of NLRP3 influenza with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same common theme that led to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where bats have seen a 95% nucleotide similarity with beta-CoV's SARS-CoV, bat-CoV has a 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While seaweed and other animals have been seen sheltering viruses similar to SARS-CoV in the markets, the closest intermediate nutrients to SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Surprisingly similar pangolin beta-CoVs have been found from SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolin may be one of the intermediate nutrients or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute to gene fractions in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is intentionally made or accidentally man-made.
The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has come to the fore.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the zoonotic corpus of HCoVs in animal origin and standard transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that the origin of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is bat and transmission in humans is by intermediate nutrients.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and seawet in markets, closing the wet markets and killing seawet there should have effectively ended the epidemic of SARS.
For the same reason, pangolin should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission due to the discovery of several genera of pangolin beta-CoVs very close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and how future checks remain to be clarified.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been entering rough camels for several decades.
These camels are important means of transport for the locals as well as major sources of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widely spread in the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to abandon all camels to control MERS as was done in China's wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures to prevent repeated outbreaks of MERS.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new gene variants may emerge to generate outbreaks.
Variety of animal CoVs are circulating in wild animals.
In particular, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
It is quite likely that these zoonotic CoVs have functional development and recombination, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are more contagious and/or deadly in humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals must be abandoned in some areas of China.
With a tough test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response plans should be made.
In fact, many viruses have been present on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural wells until there is no possibility of spreading.
Although bats have many features that help spread the virus, the chances of humans contacting them and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated about how to stay away from bats.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural nutrients which will be useful in preventing human transmission from animals and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotic disease is to keep humans away from the ecological habitats of the natural cells of the zoonotic viruses.
Many parts of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to Pangolin, it will be interesting to see which conditions inside bats and pangolins can share the same ecological habitat.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate nutrient, it should be clarified how it has a mutual effect on different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, can be receptive to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infections should be performed.
Whether it's bats, pangolins or any other mammals, it's expected that SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestral viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural nutrients in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this area will explain the gradual development pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant impacts in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the clinical criteria of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19.
On February 6, 2020, our team published Quick Consultation Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provides our experience and appropriate context for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing, based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest clinical criteria of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has now officially been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO has identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and which have been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has received a lot of attention since its release.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and information is growing gradually based on ongoing research findings and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, a total of seven editions have been released by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 with fundamental changes in certain contexts in the guidelines issued for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/).
Now that a comment has been made by Zhou et al. on our guideline, they have introduced a simple marking proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidelines and gave valuable references to the pandemic around the world.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (the seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), a comprehensive analysis is required to combine any one item of epidemiological history with two items of clinical manifestations, or three items of clinical manifestations if there is no clear pandemic history:
Epidemiology: (1) the history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) the history of contact with the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases in the locality (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) the history of contact with other Wuhan city and surrounding areas (with the history of contact with the previous cases of COVID-19 cases); or the history of contact with the previous cases (with positive nucleic acid tests); or respiratory symptoms of the contact with other people with COVID-19 cases; (3) the community; or respiratory symptoms; or respiratory symptoms; or respiratory symptoms; (3) other cases; or respiratory symptoms; or respiratory symptoms; or respiratory symptoms; or respiratory symptoms; or respiratory diseases; or respiratory infections; and other cases; and other cases; or respiratory symptoms; or respiratory symptoms; or respiratory diseases; and other cases; or respiratory symptoms; and other cases; or respiratory infections; and other cases; or respiratory symptoms; and other cases; or respiratory symptoms; or respiratory infections; or respiratory symptoms; and other cases; and other cases; or respiratory symptoms; and other cases; and other cases.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total number of white blood cells showing normal, reduced or low lymphocyte at an early stage.
Diagnosis of confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with a single item of pathological or serological evidence that is the following: (1) the real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is positive in the acute stage of the disease; (2) the viral whole genome sequencing is showing high symmetry from the known novel coronaviruses; and (3) the specificity of SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory system or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) versions.
The pathogenic identification of the blood sample was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020) editions; and then ceramic evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These amendments were based on the ongoing work of the researchers, who search for an optimal nucleic acid identification kit for quick diagnosis, as well as samples of the respiratory system, including blood samples, which increased the availability of various samples, and support bringing specific immune positive results to confirmed criteria.
In addition, there are many evidences that remind us to be careful with untreated symptomatic and symptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s flow chart should be updated, as they have classified a person with no clinical symptoms as a "low risk."
The points system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will come out and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases," we suggest exploring and following the latest guidelines from their home countries.
Our team will also update its guidelines from time to time to offer help.
Five new COVID-19 deaths have been reported in Bangladesh, the highest single-day death toll so far
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in a day.
This is the highest single-day death toll due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of confirmed cases, including 114 active cases and 33 people who recovered from the disease while at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported so far.
In an online news briefing, Dr Mirzadi Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said four men and one woman had died.
According to Dr Mirzadi, the age of two patients was between 60 and 60, and the age of one was between 41 and 50 years.
He also stated that two of the deceased were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11.
The deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Anti-Corruption Commission in Bengal and was being cared for at Kuwait Friendship Hospital, a hospital official told a local news centre, Anadolu Agency.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh Road Transport and Bridges Minister Ubaidul Qader said that by next Saturday, road transport will be closed for longer than previously planned.
The public transport ban began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential items such as medical items, fuel and food was not prohibited.
The initial cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in two people who returned from Italy on March 8 and the wife of one of them.
On March 19th, all three were fine.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide has crossed one million.
Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide crossed one million.
COVID-19 has been linked to at least 52,000 deaths.
On the day the figure crossed, Malawi reported its first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first death.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was among the few countries still free from coronavirus infections.

The US has recorded more than 2,44,000 coronavirus cases and at least 5,900 deaths.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the US on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Thursday extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will continue to receive salaries without going to work until April 30.

Stores in Australia reduce the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper they can buy at one time in all their stores at the national level to two and one package, respectively.
Aldi also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on checkout sites and on the Facebook pages of the series.
It is reported that buyers were shopping together for a situation where they needed to be most isolated due to fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the limit for buying toilet paper for home delivery on a pack per order.
Before these changes, Woolworths and Coles had imposed a ban on buying a maximum of four packs at a time on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in a March 8 press release that despite the four-pack ban coming into effect, "the stock is just going to end within an hour of delivery in many stores," and called the demand unprecedented, while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, there was a "serious surge" in sales last week.
The Canberra-based Costco store also limited the volume to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles gave orders for more large packages to suppliers and also increased the frequency of delivery. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI raised stocks to make the pre-planned Wednesday special available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailer Association, said while retailers try to increase stock, it becomes difficult to do so due to restrictions imposed by the local council at the time of truck delivery.
In such a situation, when suppliers are trying to meet demand and the number of specials has already decreased, Russell is expected to increase production costs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the stock was released prematurely, some stores could not operate Wednesday special.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said the stores fill stock every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a heavy item, so it cannot be stocked in large numbers, and then, when all the stock is sold, the big shelf is left blank, making the reduction feel more rigid.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said, "This is the idea of Coles and Woolworths [that] if there were a lot of stuff on the shelf, and products like toilet paper and sanitizer [buying] could go and there were large quantities, the disturbance could have been potentially reduced."
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, said last Wednesday that their stock has been exhausted.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a company that manufactures cleanex toilet tissues, and Sorbents, Solaris Paper, said they are working 24/7 to maintain supply.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that in Melbourne, where fewer auctions are already taking place due to buyers celebrating Labor Day holidays, some property sellers are giving free toilet paper to the first bidders at the auction.
A daily printed in Darwin, the Thursday edition of NT News had an eight-page insert that was cut and given to be used as a toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, initially, stores were not willing to impose restrictions; in this report, they said they had no plans to ban purchases.
Russell Zimmerman further said that there is a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry items, handwash and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, a 12-roll two-pack limit was imposed on the purchase of Andres toilet paper in the online British supermarket Ocado on Sunday evening.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as a global pandemic.
Although the term “global epidemic” only means how far a disease is spread, not how dangerous its specific cases are, the WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to take action.
"All countries can change the course of this global pandemic right now.
If the country detects the disease in its response, treat patients, keep them isolated, trace them and unite them,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“We are extremely concerned with both the alarming level of spread and severity and the alarming level of inactivity.”
According to Dr Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is "unprecedented."
In comments published by CNN in February, he had said, “No respiratory virus other than influenza has been detected in a continuous global spread.”
Gabriasis also expressed a similar view when he said, “We have never seen a global pandemic caused by any coronavirus to date.”
"And we have never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
This new degree of the global pandemic, given in January after the WHO's Facilitation to declare the outbreak an internationally alarming public health emergency.
“One thing, it’s going to get worse,” said Dr Anthony Fochy, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
As of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide and as a result more than 4,600 deaths have been reported, the Associated Press reported.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In December 2019, the outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, which was declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
The case fatality rate in China has been assessed at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually around five days, but it can also last from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The first treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive measures include: hand washing, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for those who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by enforcing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace threat controls and facility closures.
The pandemic has caused serious global socio-economic disparities, prompted postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and panic-stricken purchases by people have led to a massive reduction in supplies.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed nationwide or on a local basis, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's students.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been instances of <0x58>enophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, East and Southeast Asian origin and others with color, and others from areas with more virus cases.
Low travel and heavy industry shutdowns have led to reductions in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in China's Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) reported collective cases of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the wholesale market of Hunan seafood and therefore the virus is considered to be a zoonotic origin.
The outbreak virus, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus with a close relationship to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. Later on 1 December 2019, the first known person with symptoms was detected to fall ill, and the person after that showed no association with the group of the meat market.
Two-thirds of the early group of cases reported in December 2019 were found to be linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post reported that one case was of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province on 17 November 2019, which may be the first case. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that with the decrease in new cases in China, there has been a sudden increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China was higher than the number of new cases within China for the first time.
Fewer cases may have been reported in people with particularly mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported in young people, of whom 19 years of age and under were 2.4% of cases worldwide. United Kingdom’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Wallace, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before getting effective group immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and according to the official protocols whose test has been positive confirmed.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies not to test only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that these undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the original fertility number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
The majority of people infected with COVID-19 are recovering.
In those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, COVID-19 had caused nearly 97,000 deaths.
In China, as of February 5, nearly 80% of deaths were in people over 60, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official calculation of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to those who were found to be positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 can be very high, as it may not include people who die without testing such as at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the additional death toll during the pandemic was 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death count.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted “we know that [the so-called death number] has been nullified”, a statement that is supported by descriptive information of low-counting in the U.S. Such numerals often occur in epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed deaths in January 2020 and
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each reported more than a dozen deaths.
As of March 13, deaths were reported in more than forty countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary according to area and time, and the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak and the population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health are affected. The death-case ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
This number varies according to the area.
In China, the mortality ratio is estimated at 17.3% (for those with symptoms starting from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms beginning after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of non-infected people diagnosed with a disease and the percentage of those dying from infection (IFR), which is a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case recovery.
Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection mortality rate for an overall pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is in line with the results of a statistical study analyzing the impact of the first randomized trial of COVID-19 in Germany and the test on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
"When left unchecked, infectious outbreaks generally stabilize and begin to decrease when there are no available nutrients for the disease," said Macy's Bonnie of Penn State University.
But it's almost impossible to make any sensible guesses as to when that will happen."
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that "it could end by June" if all countries follow the WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kuchersky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 was "probably going to be circulating for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
"I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will end completely, as it spreads very easily," said William Shefner of Vanderbilt University, "and it can turn into a seasonal disease that comes back every year."
The severity of the return will depend on the range of group immunity and mutations.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be symptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory mucus production (cuffs), low sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle pain in the joints, sore throat, headache, coldness, vomiting, hemorrhage, diarrhea or nympha. According to WHO, about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty in breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden tremor, difficulty waking up, and blue of face or lips; immediate medical care is advised when these symptoms are present. Severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome from the more development of this disease.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but test results confirm infection, so researchers have issued advice that people with close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and checked so that the infection is removed.
The Chinese estimate of the asymptomatic ratio ranges from some to 44%.
The normal morbidity period (the time between the infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days. An example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who had lost their sense of smell, was initially 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some details on how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and by small drops generated during coughing, sneezing, or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that the droplets can range from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some people have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by small drops that are generated during speaking, which remain in the air for a longer period of time. Breathing drops can also arise while breathing out, including while talking, although the virus is not normally airborne.
Drops can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly through breathing in the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as duct penetration and heart pulmonary therapy (CPR) can lead to respiration of respiratory secretions and thus airborne proliferation.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are also concerns that it can spread by stool, its risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although communication may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
Testing for people's disease has come positive for three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of confirmed asymptomatic cases are present in the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
According to the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other individuals. This virus lives on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, up to a day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. Tests of pets and other animals have come positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, such as after exposure to other surfaces touched by the infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the corresponding coronaviruses present in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from domestic soap, which decomposes its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be a virus of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with two bat-derived breeds of the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenre of the Serbecovirus (genital B).
This is equivalent to 96% of other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in parts of genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and viruses from humans.
So far in comparison to the entire genome, general genetic content between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a maximum of 92%, which is insufficient for pangolins to proliferate intermediate nutrients.
The infection can be detected temporarily by the virus based on symptoms, although the reverse transcription of the infected secretion at the end is from polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT images.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although its many image features are less typical with other pneumoniaes and pathological processes being similar.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used as a primary test to check or diagnose COVID-19."
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which was released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is carried out on the nasagrasani fungus, but a sore swab can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be widely approved for use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the U.S. has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Characteristic image characteristics of symptomatic people on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) include asymptomatic peripheral ground glass ambiguities and absent pulmonary secretions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imagery findings for confirmed cases.
Being similar to other infections such as adenovirus, without being confirmed by PCR, there is limited specificity of imagery in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although imagery is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its idea as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial knowledge-based winding neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of the virus with both radiographs and CT.
To prevent transmission of the disease, strategies include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a tissue and putting that tissue directly into a garbage can.
People who may have pre-infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have banned or advised non-essential travel to countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the state of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they got infected. Care providers taking care of an infected person are recommended to take standard precautions, take contact precautions and protect the eyes. Contact tracing for health authorities is an important way to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data of mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for limitations on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been implemented or proposed, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log closer to one user's other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they are in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about ways to prevent infection are spreading; for example, rubbing the nose and garnishing the mouthwash is not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent transmission of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty; before eating; and after spraying, coughing or sneezing the nose.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which inflames its protective bubbles.
Additionally, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be disinfected from multiple spores, including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant to a stainless steel surface).
Other slurry, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at a facility like office or day care, all areas such as offices, toilets, public places, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick persons should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with an elbow while coughing or sneezing and then immediately dispose of any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing masks may limit the amount of drops and the distance to be covered by the breath that spreads when talking, sneezing and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “ wearing a mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene.” Masks have also been recommended to be used by people who are caring for someone with the disease.
The WHO has recommended healthy people to wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have started encouraging the use of face masks by ordinary people.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by normal healthy people, especially when they come in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned entry to public places without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam has requested everyone to wear face masks when they go to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all persons entering the grocery store to wear face masks.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear face masks when they go to the public sector.
Taiwan, which produces ten million masks per day since mid-March, has made it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks in trains and intercity buses on April 1.
While Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks while going out, it is also recommended to make homemade face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control functions, which aim to slow the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Its methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using a greeting without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now making social distancing mandatory or recommended in areas affected by the outbreak.
The rapid reduction in the maximum mass of people recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations ranged from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in an area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned a public crowd of more than two people. Older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and anaerobic immune system began to have a greater risk of severe disease and complications in contact with the “social distancing” so as to make it easier for them to “have contact with other areas with community outbreaks” and they are advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in the end of March 2020.
The use of the term “to create social distancing” created implications that, instead of encouraging people to stay in touch with others through alternative means, full social isolation should be adopted. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations for having sex with only the person living with you, who does not have symptoms of the virus or the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in the affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine guidelines have been issued in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have come into contact with someone infected with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with a widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible risk.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are prevention or suppression, and mitigation.
The prevention is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to detect infected people as well as implement other measures and vaccinations to control infection so as to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts go into mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
The combination of both prevention and mitigation measures can be done at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the original fertility number to 1. Part of managing the outbreak of infectious disease is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as reducing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services crippling and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medicinal interventions that can manage outbreaks include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks on face and self-quarantine; stricter measures intended to create physical distancing, such as stricter measures such as closing schools and canceling mass gathering events; as well as community participation to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea began mass testing and localized quarantines, and issued warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who self-quarantineed and imposed huge fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the U.S. show that there are major challenges in mitigation ( slowing the spread of the pandemic but not stopping) and suppression (reversing the development of the pandemic).
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce the demand for extreme health care by 2/3 and death by half, but even after that, hundreds of people die and health systems crumble.
Suppression can be prioritized, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is spreading to the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it is first), otherwise the transmission from laxity to the measures returns faster.
The long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic generates social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Taking cold-skinned drugs without prescription, drinking fluids, and relaxing can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The results may be worse with the use of steroids.
Many compounds that are already approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being examined for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to the WHO, some "traditional and home remedies" may relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity for the needs of COVID-19 patients and optimizing health care, has been described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The ECDC and WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for the transfer of resources to hospitals and primary health care services at several levels, including: focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, canceling selective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolated COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and the number of ventilators available.
There are many opinions about where the first case (so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of novel coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly connected to the wholesale market of Hunan sea-food, in which living animals were also sold, and one opinion is that the virus came from one of the animals of this type; or, in other words, it belongs to a zoonotic origin. The unknown-caused pneumonia group was observed on December 26 and which was treated by Zhang Gixian, a physician at Hubei provincial hospital, on December 27.
On December 30, a group of Wuhan Central Hospital physicians alerted their colleagues about the "SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumours and another doctor, I Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the WHO.
A number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, resulting in the start of January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven-and-a-half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to movement due to Chinese New Year and being the Wuhan transport center and major rail exchange.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official statistics show that as of 20 January 2020, symptoms had already developed in 6,174 people. As of 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
There is at least one case in nearly 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen region have banned free movement and established border controls.
National responses include containment measures such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the U.S. or about 90% of the population are in some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people in the Philippines are in lockdown, nearly 59 million people in South Africa are in lockdown, and in India 1.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of lockdown, rising to 2.6 billion people two days later - nearly a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been detected in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; an unconfirmed report shows that the first case occurred on November 17.
Doctor Zhang Jixian saw a group of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on December 26, after which his hospital informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was informed on the same day.
After receiving these information, doctors were warned by police in Wuhan to "spread rumours" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a fierce campaign to stop the spread of the virus, called the "people's war" by <0x58>i Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.
Described as the "biggest quarantine in human history," a siege zone was announced on January 23 to prevent movement in Wuhan, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were canceled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoshensen Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later another hospital, Lishensen Hospital, was built to handle additional patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities such as conference centers and stadiums in Wuhan to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government established additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including the issuance of health announcements for travelers and the extension of the spring festival holiday.
Schools and universities across the country have also been closed.
The areas of Hong Kong and Macau established a number of measures, particularly in relation to schools and universities.
Measures to work remotely were established in many Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was revised, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
The movement of the public was controlled in many cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of external ban. After its global stage of the outbreak in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "coming" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On 23 March, only one case was transmitted domestically in the last five days in mainland China, in this instance through a passenger returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of cases transmitted domestically has been originally stopped and the outbreak in China has been controlled.
Two months after the lockdown was imposed, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, on the same day. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March 26, 2020, that entry for visa or residence permit holders will be suspended from March 28, with no specific details on when the policy will end.
Those who want to enter China will have to apply for a visa to Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for businesses. The State Council on April 4, at 10:00 am, declared a day of mourning by starting with a three-minute national silence, which was at the time of the Kimming festival, although the central government asked families to pay homage to make physical distance online to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
On January 20, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The nation's health agency recorded a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, linked largely to a crowd gathering in Digu of a new religious movement known as the Shinchiji Church of Jesus.
The Shinchiji devotees coming from Wuhan were suspicious of the origin of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 or about 13% of the Church’s 9,336 followers reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of warning on 23 February 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which rose to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined when tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline programs were also affected and therefore changed. The program that South Korea introduced was considered to be the largest and best organized program in the world to check the population for the virus and isolate any infected people, as well as detect and quarantine those who contact them.
Screening methods included mandatory self-information of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile applications, quick testing for the virus with the results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to test 20,000 people per day.
South Korea’s program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining the entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided on the response to President Moon Jae-in’s crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment, claiming the government's mismanagement of the outbreak, or praised his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was informed that all new foreign arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks from April 1.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests from 121 different countries for virus testing assistance.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kom on February 19, where two people died later that day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included closing concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and Friday prayers, and universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion riyals to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there was no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak and only individuals would be quarantined.
The plan to limit travel between cities was announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities continued ahead of the Persian New Year Navroz.
As of March 16, 2020, the Shia shrine in Kom was open to pilgrims. During February, Iran became the epicentre of virus transmission after China.
Amid claims of concealing the amount of outbreaks in Iran, more than ten countries found their cases to be linked to Iran as of February 28, indicating that the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that day.
The Iranian parliament was closed on March 3, when 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, the Human Rights Watch also urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful protests and temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It said closed institutions like containment centres are at a higher risk of spreading the virus, which also lacks adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
As of March 23, Iran was reporting 50 new cases every hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there could be five times as many cases as reported in Iran.
It has also been suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may have affected the country's financial capacity to respond to a viral outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded relief in economic sanctions for the most affected nations, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to grow rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights from China and declare a state of emergency.
Starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21, an unrelated group of COVID-19 cases was detected. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new judicial-law to prevent the outbreak, quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In areas with outbreaks, entry and exit will not be provided.
Work activities and sporting events in those areas have already been ordered to be postponed. “On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 deaths occurred in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held without spectators by April, but on March 9, all games were completely postponed for at least a month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered to stop almost all business activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding protocols for sedation of severe patients, which could be employed.
On March 19, Italy surpassed China in terms of the highest coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths from the pandemic.
On March 22, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft to Italy with medical equipment.
As of April 5, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries.
A CNN report indicated that a combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test people who had the virus by that time may have contributed to higher mortality.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus initially emerged as the slowest of the affected countries, and by March 18, 2020, the British government had not implemented any social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the alleged lack of speed and intensity in response to concerns faced by the public. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised to stop all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people to work from home wherever possible and avoid places like pubs, restaurants, and theatres.
On March 20, the government announced that all entertainment establishments such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages to the extent of <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in distress. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced measures to create strict social distancing, including restrictions on gathering of more than two people and outdoor activities.
Contrary to previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by the police through fines imposed and crowd squabbling.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except businesses deemed “essential”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations and garages.
On January 20, the first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in a person in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington, who returned from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was established on January 29.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency, and banned entry of passengers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control - the U.S. government's leading public health institution - announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the U.S. made a slow start in testing, making it difficult to understand the actual extent of the outbreak at the time.
The trial was interrupted by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal government approval for non-government testing kits (by academics, companies, and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to be eligible for a test by the beginning of March (then a doctor's order was required).
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests were conducted in the US.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On 22 March, The Associated Press reported: “Many people who have symptoms and have a doctor’s order waited for hours or days for a trial.” Governor J.

Schools in the Seattle area canceled classes on March 3 and by the middle of March, schools across the country were being closed. On March 6, 2020, the United States was advised by a group of epidemiologists at Imperial College London about estimates of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, which provided <0x24>8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to respond to the outbreak.
Corporations imposed employee travel restrictions, canceled conferences and encouraged employees to work from home.

On March 25, the governor said social distancing was working, as the doubling estimate of the case slowed from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of March 28, New York City had 32,308 confirmed cases, and 672 deaths from the virus. On March 26, the US reported more confirmed coronavirus infections than any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of April 8, the US has reported 400,335 confirmed cases, and 12,841 deaths.

The overall likes of the management of the crisis by Trump are intertwined with biased forms.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized U.S. reliance on imports of critical materials, including essential medical supplies from China.

Not much is known about COVID-19, according to it, and that Australia will insist on border control and communication in response to the pandemic.
On March 21, a human biosecurity emergency was declared in Australia.
Due to the effective quarantine of public transport in Wuhan and Hubei, many countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the region, mainly through the home nation's chartered flights, for which Chinese authorities have approved.

Belgium withdrew 100,000 unused masks, believed to have come from China, but actually came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well received in Latin America and parts of Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency aid campaigns for developing countries.
The WHO has appreciated the efforts of Chinese authorities in managing and containment of the pandemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of privacy that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government has provided regular updates to avoid fear before the Lunar New Year holidays.
On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement the transportation ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galia commented that while “the WHO did not recommend the first outbreak of the outbreak since 2009” this “was a very important sign of the WHO’s commitment to preventing the epidemic at the place where it is most concentrated” and called it “Jan unprecedented in public health history.”
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was the cause of "the risk of global spread, especially in low and middle-income countries without strong health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said “there is no reason for such measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement.”
On February 5, the WHO called for a <0x24>675 million contribution from the global community to strategic preparation in low-income countries, citing the need to help countries that "do not have systems set up to detect people infected with the virus, even if it was about to emerge."
Tedros announced in further statements, that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later". On February 11, the WHO established at a press conference as the name of the disease of COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the power of the entire UN system in response."
As a result, a crisis management team of the United Nations was activated, which coordinated the response of the entire United Nations, which according to the WHO would enable them to "focus on health response, while other agencies could use their expertise in enduring the widespread social, economic, and developmental implications of the outbreak."
On February 14, a WHO-led joint mission team with China, in order to assist in domestic management and by hosting workshops and meetings with major national-level institutions, the WHO must immediately announce that it must have been "provided to assess the severity and contagiousness of the disease" and to assess the impact of the response activities at the provincial and county levels, to China.
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO authorities said the global coronavirus threat would be assessed from "high" to "very high," which is the highest level of alertness and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergency program, warned in a statement that "this is a reality check for every government on Earth: it's time to wake up."
This virus may be on its way and you need to be prepared," insisting that the right response measures can help the world avoid "its worst."
Ryan further said that current data has not convinced public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean “we are essentially accepting that every human being on Earth will come into contact with that virus.”
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO was "deeply concerned by both alarming levels of spread and severity and dangerous levels of inactivity." The WHO has faced great criticism as inadequate management of the pandemic, including delays in declaring a public health emergency and categorizing the virus as a pandemic.
The retraction, signed by 733,000 people until April 6, included a petition for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respecting the rights of every person during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group said everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and it is the responsibility of the government.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts emphasized that everyone, including people with disabilities, minority groups, elderly people, internally displaced people, homeless, people living in extreme poverty, people living in quarantine, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government assistance, has the right to health.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information as well as perspectives and advice on policy responses in countries around the world.
From policies to strengthening health systems and from the world economy to addressing the effects of travel bans and restrictions, the digital hub includes a country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The U.S. government's response to the outbreak in the Chinese province of Hubei, Britain's Minister for Cabinet Office Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro have been criticised.
Several provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were sacked for dealing with quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political institution's response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party general secretary <0x58>i Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected a prior admissibility of the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, which was in favor of conspiracies about COVID-19 originating from the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying China's "control system has now turned a virus into a global pandemic", which some critics have considered racism and "violent by their administration's failure to prevent disease."
The Daily Beast received a U.S. government wire that underlines communication mortarism with a clear origin in the National Security Council, citing as a strategy that “everything is about China.”
We are being asked to try to send this message in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. “Outlets like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China’s attempt to send aid to countries affected by the virus is part of the campaign to increase global influence.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that it has "a geopolitical component that includes conflict and "politics of generosity" for influence through reshuffles."
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively advancing the message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China has also called on the United States to lift sanctions from Syria, Venezuela and Iran, which have reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
The donation of Jack Ma's 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of converting intended aid to other nations to their own country.
And there have been mask-related disputes between Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and other countries such as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of designated ventilators for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of EU solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Italy's Ambassador to the European Union Maurizio Mussari said that "only China responded bilaterally."
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper cited an unnamed "high-level political source," saying 80 percent of Russia's aid was "unfair or little use of Italy."
The source accused Russia of "geopolitical and diplomatic" flattering.
Lombardy President Atilio Fontaana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia sent medical aid material from a cargo plane to the US.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “While offering assistance to US allies [Putin] believe that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials will increase production, they will also be able to pay returns if necessary.”
The largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the NATO "Defender 2020" military exercise will be held at a low level.
Secretary-General of Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: “In the current public-health crisis, it is jeopardizing not only the lives of soldiers in the United States and many European countries, but also the residents of the participating countries where they are working.” The Iranian government has been greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen other former parliament members infected or with political prisoners.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders seeking help on March 14, 2020, stating that his country, as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran, has been struggling to fight the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets. This outbreak has prompted the U.S. to share its policy toward other countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health.
Political analysts speculated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
Japan's "clear and passive quarantine efforts" were criticized by South Korea when Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at designated sites by the government.
South Korean society was initially divided on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment, claiming the government’s mismanagement of the outbreak, or applauded his response. The pandemic has prompted countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could help governments strengthen their hold on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule indefinitely, suspending elections as well as parliament and punishing those who were found to be dealing with the virus and crisis and spreading false information about the government.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages that arose from the use of tools to fight the outbreak globally, fear-induced shopping, and disruptions in factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about the shortage of medicines and medical devices due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruptions.
Many areas also saw panic-induced shopping conditions, which led to shortages of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water from the shelves, leading to a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warned about delays in transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, there has been a 100-fold increase in demand for personal protective equipment.
This demand has led to a 20-fold increase in the normal price and delay in supply of medical items for four to six months.
This has led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, which the WHO has warned will jeopardize health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided Diagu shoppers with a new opportunity to sell Australian products in China.
This activity caused a shortage of infant formulas in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and high demand for food products, both regions have been spared from excessive shortages of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against hoarding and illegal trading of important products have been successful, preventing excessive shortages of food that were projected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a major drop in its significant agricultural output, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelfs were also seen only temporarily in the city of Wuhan, when Chinese government officials issued stockpiles of pork to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws in Italy make it mandatory for food producers to have reserves for such emergencies.
The global economy in China has suffered losses: According to a media report on March 16, government measures to prevent the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%, causing deep injury to the economy in China in the first two months of 2020.
Since mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the outbreak of the virus has been considered to pose a major volatile threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demaris of the Economist Intelligence Unit has estimated that the markets will remain volatile until a clear image emerges on the possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the pandemic on global growth could be greater than the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis showed an impact of <0x24>300<0x2B> billion on the world supply chain that could last for two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly "flashed" after oil prices dropped sharply due to lower demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
Due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak on February 27, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 index, Dow Jones Industrial Average, reported the sharpest drop since 2008, with Dow dropping 1,191 points, the biggest drop in a day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
All three indices fell more than 10% that week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign creditworthiness determination, but maintained a negative expectation.
Stocks fell again on the basis of coronavirus fears, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many consider the possibility of an economic downturn.
Economist Mohammed Al-Aryan praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst-affected regions due to the advice of governments to ban travel, close public places, including tourist attractions, prevent any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantes, have cancelled flights due to low demand, while British regional airline flybys collapsed.
Its impact on the cruise line industry was the most seen so far.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The timing of this pandemic also coincides with the time of Chunyuan, the major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
A large number of events, including annual New Year celebrations, were cancelled by national and regional governments, as well as private companies independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several lunar New Year celebrations and tourist attractions have been closed in Beijing to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and territories, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, with most workplaces instructed not to reopen until that date.
These sectors represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, including closing schools until March and canceling its New Year's celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with store hours falling or temporarily closed.
Retailers' visits to Europe and Latin America have declined by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
People who walked up to shopping centres in March fell 33-43% compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world took additional measures, such as an increase in hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of ceremonies. The pandemic-induced slowdown could leave 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America who would not be in that situation without the pandemic, according to a UN Economic Commission for Latin America estimates.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are stranded at home in the inland provinces or stranded in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cut 47 million jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate could fall by 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates. Many million migrant workers in India have become unemployed due to the lockdown. The survey of Angus Reed Institute found that 44% of Canadian families lost their jobs in March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal loan scheme. About half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers on short-term working plans funded by the government called Kurjarbet.
The German short-term work compensation plan has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been heavily affected by the pandemic, which has affected both the functioning of organizations globally as well as individuals working and working independently.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector attempted to maintain their (primarily: publicly funded) mission to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of its employees and public, and to support artists where possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, exhibition venues, and other cultural institutions were closed for an indefinite period with their exhibitions, events, and exhibitions cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Recently another and rapidly growing result of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social gatherings, such as music festivals and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week observation in Rome, which takes place during the last week of Lent's Christian condolence session, has been canceled.
Many bishops-regions have recommended elderly Christians stay at home instead of attending mass on Sunday; some churches have provided church services via radio, online live streaming, or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
With Rome’s Roman Catholic bishop-region closing its churches and prayers and vacating Christian pilgrims from St. Peter’s Square, other religious bodies have also canceled services in churches, mosques, Jewish worshiphouses, temples and gurudwaras and restricted public gatherings.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and later shut down shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as citizens at holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has created the most significant disruption in the sporting calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been canceled or postponed.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled on a date beyond 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021".
This is why many gamblers are adopting an online method, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling concerts.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, also suspended all demonstrations.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as creating live streaming or web-based "events" of concerts to promote performers' performance, distribution, and their work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed Internet memes have spread as humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, increasing prejudice to people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and people with hotspots in Europe, America, and other countries, <0x58>enophobia and racism have been noted.
Many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have witnessed incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
In information from February (when most of the cases were still limited to China), racist sentiments of Chinese people in different groups around the world have been documented, being worth getting the virus or receiving justifiable punishment.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Online and offline help is available for Chinese people and people in areas affected by the virus.
After the progress of the outbreak in new hotspot countries, Italy’s first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19 can also experience suspicion and <0x58>enophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to prevent the disease.
The hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan went viral on Twitter.
The Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the US have reported increasing levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus," which was considered racist and anti-Chinese by critics.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign-born people from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students coming from Northeast India, bordering China, who study in major Indian cities, have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state unit in West Bengal, said the Chinese have destroyed nature and "so God has avenged them."
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the comment, calling it "wrong." In China, <0x58>enophobia and racism were promoted by the pandemic to non-Chinese residents, describing foreigners as targeted for "foreign trash" and "repatriation."
Many newspapers with pavilions removed him for part or whole of his coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers provided outbreak-related scientific papers with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as BioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods to detect the presence of viruses and to detect antibodies produced as a response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Immune detection (blood-science) can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance of people.
Immune tests show how many people have been infected, including those with mild symptoms or who were symptomatic.
The results of this investigation can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of mass immunity in people.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in people as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there are considerable inequalities over how much has been tested in different countries.
This disparity is also likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be significantly higher in some countries.
By using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), respiration samples obtained by various methods, including samples of nasgrossani phaha or mucus, can be checked.
The results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test done with sore throat is reliable in the first week of the disease itself.
Later the virus may disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For those infected checked in the second week, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from the airway from the inside through the suction catheter or used in the coughing material.
One of the earliest PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed in January 2020 in Berlin in Charit<0xC3><0xA9>, and became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test kit until 23 January 2020. The South Korean company CoganBiotech developed a clinical category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 testing kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
This is the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and specifically the RdRp gene found in the public health diagnostics of the SARS-CoV-2 gene. In China, the BGI group was the first to receive emergency use approval of the SARS-CoV-2 test kit from the National Medical Products Administration of China, USA.
In one of the older versions of the test kit, faulty reagents resulted in unconfirmed results, and caused problems in checking on the CDC in Atlanta; this led to an average of less than 100 samples a day of successfully processed samples throughout February 2020.
The tests using the two components were not considered reliable till 28 February 2020 and till then state and local laboratories were not allowed to initiate the tests.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authority. The US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced availability across the country of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics made available COVID-19 testing across the country till March 9, 2020.
No quantity limitations were announced; the aggregation and processing of samples should be carried out according to the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
This check was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare on 11 February 2020. On 12 March 2020, it was reported to have developed checks to detect the infection of COVID-19 of Mayo Clinic. On 13 March 2020, Rosh Diagnostics received permission from the FDA for a high-volume check within 3.5 hours, as a result of which approximately 412 checks can be done over a 24-hour period from a machine.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to check on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Holologic, Labcorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, the same Sheffield received the EUA from the FDA for a check that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a probe that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can give positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to increase manufacturing for 50,000 checks every day. A check kit is being developed in Taiwan that uses monoclonal antibodies that specifically attaches to the novel coronavirus’s nucleocapsid protein (N protein), with the hope that this rapid influenza test can occur in 15 minutes.
A literature review of March 2020 concluded that “the chest radiograph in the early stages has less clinical significance, while CT [computerized tomography] findings may be available even before the onset of symptoms.”
Typical features of CT include bilateral multilober ground-glass opacity with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, the effect of subplural, crazie paving and consolidation develops.
A study comparing PCR's CT to the current pandemic's source point, Wuhan, has suggested that many of the CT's portrayal characteristics are similar to that of other pneumonia and pathological processes, despite being less specific, it is significantly more sensitive than PCR.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used as a check or first-line check to diagnose COVID-19." As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for primary screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to determine immunity starting in individuals from 7 days or so after the onset of symptoms and to detect infection to monitor people. Tests can be done in central labs (CLTs) or through point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Automatic systems with high flow capacity in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is usually used for CLT, although a series of samples can be used to see the immune response.
A single sample of blood for POCT is usually obtained from the skin puncture.
The FDA on March 26, 2020 designated 29 units that provided information to the agency when needed and thus are now able to distribute their immune checks.
As of 7 April 2020, only one check was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authority. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe’s approval for their testing kits that could detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
Immunes can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK found that any immune check kits purchased by them were not good enough for use.
Hong Kong planned in which suspected patients can stay at home, “the emergency department will provide a sample tube to the patient”, they will spit in it and get the result of the test in a short time. British NHS declared that they are initiating a plan to examine the suspected cases at home with the appropriate medical care, which eliminates the risk of infecting others of the patient if he goes to the hospital or used the COVID-bule.
Drive-through check centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive checks from any country. In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they had the capacity to carry out about 12,000 checks per day in the Ambulatory setting and tested 10,700 in the last week.
When the check order is given by the doctor, the cost is borne by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's total capacity is 160,000 checks per week.
By March 19, drive-through checks were offered in several big cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey observed that by the week 12/2020, a total of 483,295 samples were tested in the trial of the test period of the test of the test of the test at least 5,491 (6.9%) in the English language of the test conducted by the test of the test of the samples in the course of the year 2020. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rembem Hospital found the combination of the samples and if the combined sample.
With BGI founder Wang Jian overseeing the construction and taking 5 days, the model has observed that if this testing capacity was not started, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan Laboratory’s Huo-Yen labs have been followed immediately by Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiplexed open source frameworks have been issued by Origami Essay which can check up to samples of as many as 1122 patients of COVID19 using 93 tests. These balanced outlines can run in small labs without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
Prior to March, the shortcomings and insufficient amounts of reagent caused problems in large-scale testing in the EU, UK and US.
This prompted some authors to explore protocols for sample preparation that included warming samples to 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to free up RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now reaching a larger level of population at the rate of one per capita, and that the country was also more than any other country to check for the coronavirus of its population.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru testing capability and purchasing a population-scale mass-thruput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency testing laboratories in China).
Made in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory in the world to operate on such a large scale outside China.
Various testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted and sent Germany's method of manufacturing kits for developing low-income countries with a lack of resources.
The German law was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control of the United States was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. At the beginning of the outbreak there were problems on the reliability of the test kit between China and the United States and these supplies were sufficient to meet the demand and recommendations of the investigation by the country and Australia health experts.
On the contrary, experts point out that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capacity, especially in private sector laboratories, was developed over the years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that increasing the testing programs is the best way to slow the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the widespread spread of the virus, thousands of pending tests were piled up in private U.S. laboratories and the supply of phasors and chemical reagents became strained.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems in its testing kits.
In the United States, the check kits developed by the CDC were “low”; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that were preventing private checks. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biotechnology Co. Ltd., but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm pointed out that the wrong results could be due to the failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the wrong checking kits and replace them with the second test kits that were made available by Shenzhen BioEgi. 80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic gave false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million check kits from China, which were not found to be accurate.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that these should be put into the danube. Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said that the check kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and that they "did not use them". The UK which purchased 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020, announced that they were not usable.
Those who tested positive after the test were quarantined and those who came in contact with positive SARS-CoV-2 were found to have positive results.
In place of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, researchers working in Italy's V<0xC3><0xB2> town examined the entire population of nearly 3,400 people twice over a span of about ten days.
Nearly half of those with positive results had no symptoms, and those with all detected cases were quarantined.
The travel ban on the incoming place completely eliminated the new infections.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has grown significantly slower than other developed countries in Singapore without aggressively detecting contact, internal travel restrictions, checking and quarantine, but without imposing extreme restrictions such as forcefully closing restaurants and retail establishments.
Many programs have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home from March 28, but reopened on March 23 after school holidays.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic by aggressive contact tracing, internal travel restrictions, checking and quarantining, but less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have shown that in countries where there have been more tests than the number of deaths, the case fatality rate is much lower, possibly because these countries are only more capable of detecting mild or symptomatic people.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to test and who have limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Out of 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "% of the test positive" is influenced by the country's check policy.
On the other hand, in a country where only hospitalized people are examined, the percentage of positive tests will be higher than in a country where all citizens are screened, regardless of whether they show symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning your hands with the aim of removing mud, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap regularly at any “necessary moments” during a day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and haeja, which are transmitted through the fecal-faced route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five important moments during the day where washing hands with soap is important are: before and after defecation, after changing the baby's buttocks, before feeding, before eating and preparing food or before and after consuming raw meat, fish or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hand ash can be cleaned. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing at the following times:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child using the toilet.
After brushing, coughing, or sneezing your nose.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before providing medication or medical care may prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main therapeutic purpose of hand washing is to clean the pathogens (bacterial, virus, or other microorganisms that can cause the disease) and chemicals by hand that can cause harm or diseases.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important action for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the infant mortality rate in cases of childbirth at home.
A 2013 study showed that well-hand washing practices in children under five could slightly improve their length.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as starting hand washing with soap, can reduce infant mortality related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple task can reduce the mortality from these diseases by about 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in cases of diarrhea can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap as a self-motivated behavior in homes, schools, and communities around the world is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea, and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
A major ARI, pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under five, with an estimated 18 million children dying each year.
About 35 million children die each year due to diarrhea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap a strong habit before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or therapeutic measure, which can reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea to about half and the number of deaths from acute respiratory infections by up to one-fourth.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other cleaning system measures as part of water, sanitation and sanitation (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that spreads through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin due to the skin's dryness.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy, flaky skin conditions known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Hand washing too often is also seen as a symptom of psychotic- Obligation Disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce transmission through the fecal-faced route of the disease: after using the toilet (impure discharge, feces-discharge), after cleaning the baby's buttocks (after changing the longot), before feeding the baby, before eating and preparing food or before consuming raw meat, fish or mucus.
Other occasions when proper technique of hand washing should be practiced to prevent transmission of the disease, they are: before and after the treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or spraying your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching the waste.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households adopted the practice of hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that the practice of washing hands with soap was the highest rate of 97 percent of the time in Saudi Arabia. With 77 percent of children washing hands, this rate was moderate in the US; and with 23 percent it was the lowest rate in China for many to raise hand-washing behaviors with soap at critical times.
The "necessary health care program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of massive action to promote children's health and education.
The core of this national programme is to clean your teeth daily from fluoride as well as wash your hands daily with soap, taking anti-worm treatment twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
It is better to remove microorganisms from the skin by mixing soap or detergent in water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce obstacles in the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an unskilled skin purifier because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, sufficient flow of water in cleaning is obtained.
Due to repeated use, solid soaps can contain bacteria remaining from previous uses.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that there is no possibility of transfer due to dusting with the foam of the bacteria.
However, according to the CDC, "soaps with a liquid soap-bearing feature on the palms without touching hands are better."
The campaign has been focused on antibacterial soaps for the health conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants cause antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which have a comprehensive list of resistant breeds of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibacterial soaps do not produce antibiotic resistant breeds, they may not be as effective as they are promoted to be effective.
In addition to humidifiers and skin-protecting agents, refined formulations contain the antiseptic acids (ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobialally active benzoic acids and other skin adapters (alovera, vitamins, menthol, extracts of plants) as the pH regulator.
Comfortable hot water for hand washing is not warm enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very fast at body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0> C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water to remove soil and bactericidal natural oils.
However, unlike popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand disinfector is a water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, worn-out alcohol water-free hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubbers, disinfectant hand rubbers or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these isopropyls are based on alcohol or ethanol, which are compounded with carbomers (a polymer of acrylic acids) in a gel such as a thickening agent, for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol, or a humidifier such as a liquid or glycerin in a foam.
Combining tanu hydrogen-peroxide further increases antimicrobial activation. Hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient disinfectants.
Alcohol rubber sanitisers destroy bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rubber sanitizers that contain 70% alcohol, destroy 99.97% of the bacteria after 30 seconds of implantation (like 3.5 log reduction, 35 decibel reduction) and destroy 99.99% to 99.99% of the bacteria after 1 minute of implantation (4 to 5 log reductions reductions). The hand sanitizers are some of the most effective and effective for bacteria.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer are almost completely ineffective against the type of virus norovirus (or norwalk) that is the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal inflammation. Enough hand disinfectant or alcohol rubber should be used to wet or cover both hands as a whole.
The pores of the front and back of both hands and in the middle and all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
Finger pores should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing in both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubbers, especially when hands appear dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick disinfection activation towards microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer can cause dry skin until lubricant and/or skin moisturizers are mixed into the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by mixing glycerin and/or other lubricants into formulas.
In clinical trials, lubricant-based alcohol-based hand sanitizers significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness compared to soaps or antimicrobial removers.
Contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to the additives present in alcohol or alcohol hand rubs.
The low tendency to induce troublesome contact dermatitis as compared to hand washing with soap and water became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, unwatered agents do not clean organic substances by hand, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is heavily dependent on materials and formulations, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
More recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce efficacy after repeated use due to potentially progressive adverse skin reactions, has been shown to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activation after applying formulations that use benzalkonium chloride.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil alone can be more effective than water, but can be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can increase rather than reduce the spread of the disease.
Similar to soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because in contact with water it forms a alkaline solution.
The WHO has recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the Prevention of Transmission of Disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because basins with stable water can be contaminated, although the water temperature does not matter.
Rub the appropriate amount of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails, and make the foam on the hands.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more fully when using soap instead of water alone.
Rinse for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbishing causes abrasion, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and more germs get out of the rubbing for longer periods of time.
Wash well under running water.
Washing hands in the basin can be contaminated again.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and damp hands are more easily re-contaminated. The most discounted areas are under the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers and the nails.
Nail polish with artificial nails and chippy can shelter microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to protect the hands from being dry; dry skin can damage the skin that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap is not available, various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing, if necessary, for example using watering and/or ash from a hanging martoon with suitable pores. Other water supplies (such as schools or rural areas) are available, such as water-saving solutions.
Note-Tap is a simple technique that uses a leg-operated lever, to put a small amount of water on the edge of the rope, and hands and soap.
Effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Research done in large quantities suggests that paper towels provide more hygiene than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the paper towel industry The European Tissue Symposium, aimed at comparing the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
The total number of bacteria increased by 194% on average on finger cushions and 254% on palms after hand washing and drying with a hot air dryer.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria by an average of 42% on the fingers mattress and 15% on the palms.
After washing hands and drying from paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased by 76% on average on the ankles and 77% on the palms. Scientists also tested to establish whether each type of drying method resulted in the ability to cross-contamination of other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet-air dryer, which extracts air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microorganisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
Using hot air hand dryer, microorganisms spread from dryer to 0.25 meters.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the calculation of bacteria after drying the hands:
Many different hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers have been compared with drying from paper towels.
Hand washing using hand bleaching wipes is an option in the absence of soap and water during the trip.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelvis discovered its effectiveness in disease prevention in the hospital environment (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff about washing their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with their use.
The hands are medically washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, in which the foam is made using soap and water or a reasonable amount of gel and rubbing each part of the hands.
The fingers of both hands should be rubbed together.
If there are garbage under the nails, a hard-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can stay in the water on the hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to turn off the water (and any exit door should be opened if necessary).
This prevents the re-contamination of the hands from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care system is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and prevent them from being transmitted.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine report, hand washing in most medical environments remains at unacceptable levels, in which a large number of doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, causing the transmission of microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by up to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-washing in health care areas.
Document guidance on hand hygiene available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was made by Witby and others.
Commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene if the performance of regulatory compliance is necessary.
The World Health Organization has set “five chances” for hand washing:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
prior to disinfection, and
After taking care of the patient. Adding disinfectant chemicals to soap (“Medicinal” or “antibacterial” soap) provides the hand-washing agent with the marker ability.
Before performing surgery or in an arrangement in which the antibiotic resistant organisms are highly widespread, such a marker capacity may be desired. For surgical rip-offs to 'burn' your hands, to have a tube that can be washed and closed without touching hands, some chlorohexidine or iodine wash, towels to wash hands after washing.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure usually requires washing the hands and arms for 2-6 minutes.
There is no need to rub for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, water on the wrists should be prevented from coming back to the hands.
After the hand wash is completed, the hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after the care of a sick person or use a hand disinfectant.
For the control of staphylococcal infection in hospitals, it has been found that the biggest benefit from hand cleaning came from the first 20% before washing, and when the frequency of hand cleaning increased by more than 35%, there was very little additional benefit.
By washing hands with plain soap, the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious disease is more than triple than that of washing with antibacterial soap. Compared with alcohol-based solution to rubbing hands with antibacterial soap is more than 26% of bacterial germs with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 minutes, it was revealed that the alcohol from hand rubbing
But hands-on H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium Difficile are more effective than soap and water alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce spores. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care systems include teaching, enhancing availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and writing staff.
More research is needed on which of these measures are most effective in various health care systems.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an economical, necessary means to achieve good health, and even good nutrition.
However, achieving universal hand-washing behavior is a challenge from the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand-washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces.
For example, every private or public toilet in most rural Africa has very few hand-washing taps, even though there are cheap options for creating hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates, may also be due to inserted habits rather than due to lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and support of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and bring about changes in the long-term behavior of the population.
In order for it to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systemic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social promotional campaigns are less effective. An example for the promotion of hand washing in schools is the “three-star method” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash hands with soaps along with other sanitation requirements.
When the minimum standards are achieved, schools can go up to one to three stars, respectively.
Hand washing stations can be a part of hand washing campaigns that are carried out to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to try to change behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of an emoji of hand washing.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the prevention of DALYs.
However, a review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and hygiene measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially those with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth to a child or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first identified by two promoters of hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who has worked in Vienna, Austria and the founder of Florence Nightingale, the English neo-Draz.
Most people at the time believed that the infection was caused by a foul smell called miasmus.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively increase hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with “right techniques of hand washing” were hung in public toilets and office buildings and airports in Germany near hand washing sinks.
The phrase “washing your hands” from something means declaring your unwillingness to take responsibility for or accept the connivance of that thing.
It derives from the Matthew chapter of the Bible where Pontius Pilate distinguished himself from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with very widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up a hypothetical stain, reflecting her guilty conscience about the crimes she committed and inducing her husband to commit the crime.
It has also been found that people after remembering or meditating on immoral actions, wash hands more often than others, and give more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in compensatory tasks such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing with soapy water for hand washing are a part of hand washing in many religions including Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> religion, Hinduism, T<0xC3><0xAD>vila and Netilat Yadyam in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wazoo in Islam. Religion especially provides some functions of hand washing after hand hygiene.
Washing hands after using toilets in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam is mandatory.
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infection in the workplace
Control of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infection at the workplace, for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are the applications of occupational safety and health procedures for the control of hazards.
Proper control of the risk of disease spreading at the workplace, depends on the workplace and the work to be done, which is based on risk assessment of contact sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual personnel who are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact risk actions involve minimal business contact with people and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including: hand washing, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, following respiratory etiquette, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Moderate contact risk tasks are those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not aware or suspected of having COVID-19 infection, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes personnel who have contact with the general public such as a school, a high population-density work environment, and some high-volume sales arrangements.
In addition to the basic infection prevention measures, hazard control measures for this group include: ventilation from high-capacity air filters, using a sneezing guard, and maintaining personal safety equipment available for that situation if a COVID-19 infected person is confronted.
OSHA considers healthcare personnel and morgue-house personnel at high contact risk who come in contact with a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, and this risk increases if personnel perform aerosol-producing procedures on a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, or collect or handle samples from them.
Controls of hazards suitable for these personnel include negative pressures such as engineering control and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have many effects within the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work for fear of being sick, needing to care for others, or possible contact.
What goods are in demand, and means of receiving these goods (such as low demand time or purchases through delivery or moving services), may change the nature of the business in relation to both.
Finally, the movement of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be affected. Preparation and response plans for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective actions.
Plans address risk levels associated with various workplaces and job functions, including risk factors arising from risk sources, home and community arrangements, and risk factors for individual personnel such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the controls needed to address the risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparation and response plans for infectious disease may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The goal of responding to an outbreak includes: reducing transmission among employees, protecting those at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse impacts on other entities in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in a community with a place of business affects the responses to being adopted.
The sequence of hazard controls is a structure widely used to form a group of hazard controls in accordance with the effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering control, then administrative control, and finally personal safety equipment.
Engineering controls include separating employees from work-related hazards without relying on the employee's behavior, and this may be the most economical solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in work policy or processes that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some contacts.
Personnel must be selected for all kinds of PPE based on hazard, appropriately applied (e.g., respirator), constantly and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained and changed as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact risk actions have minimal business contact with people and other coworkers.
The recommended basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include: frequent and well-washing, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, providing respiratory etiquettes covering cough and sneeze, providing the environment of regular cleaning and sneezing of tissues and wastes, preparing for remote change or transverse palates, and others, if necessary.
Early identification and segregation of potential infectious individuals at the workplace is an important step for the safety of personnel, customers, visitors, and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute carcinogen disease stay at home for at least 24 hours without being exposed to fever or other symptom-modifying medications. Members of these care groups may not be exempt from the symptoms of fever, fever, or any other symptoms, and that the family members who are sick of the disease leave policies are flexible,
According to OSHA, moderate contact risk actions include tasks that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business space, or because the person has recently traveled to the International COVID-19 site.
These include personnel who have contact with the general public such as schools, high-population-density work environments to provide personnel handling and handling of personal protective equipments to the person affected by the COVID-19 procedures, personnel handling and handling of the COVID-19 work environments, personnel who are trained to handle the COVID-19 needs of personnel, personnel with disabilities, and certain high-volume safety precautions to carry out, personnel with care, and safety-related needs.
Employees in this risk group rarely need the use of respirators.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, proper controls for the safety of personnel and other passengers include: removing the sick person to 6 feet from others, nominating a member of the crew to serve the sick person, and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear usable medical gloves when taking care of the sick passenger or touching the body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, then potentially wearing additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other usable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, there are delays on travel when the hazards are ill and other symptoms develop self-isolation and immediately inform the medical center on board if the person is on board the vessel.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the room of the individual isolated. For schools and infant care facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building absolute of community transmission.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as cancelling food in physical education or singing classes or restaurants, increasing distance between desks, shifting arrivals and holiday times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and a separate office for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is adequate transmission in the local community, extended school holidays can be considered in addition to social distancing strategies. For law enforcement personnel doing daily law activities, immediate health risk is considered as follows by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact confirmed or suspected individuals are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during the capture, personnel should clean and disinfect their duty belt and equipment, before reusing, using household cleaning sprays or wipes, and follow standard operating procedures for the prevention and disposal of used PPE and for the prevention and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some healthcare and morgue-house personnel to be in high or very high categories of contact risk.
High-contact risk actions include providing, assisting, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high contact risk if personnel perform aerosol-producing procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, collecting or handling samples from them.
Processes that produce aerosol include duct penetration, cuff induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures and examinations, or collecting samples from rip-offs.
High contact risk morgue functions include people who prepare the body of individuals with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high contact risk if they do autopsy. In additional engineering controls for these risk groups, including while performing aerosol-producing procedures, the isolation for known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Specific negative pressure in some health care and morgue-house arrangements may be appropriate.
Samples should be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case, be isolated in different waiting areas. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who are exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and those who work within 6 feet of the known or suspected patients who are infected with the virus, and who work within 6 feet.
In the U.S., N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better approved by NIOSH should be used in terms of a comprehensive, written respiratory safety program that includes fit-testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide more protection and improve employee comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids.
The WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening personnel at the entrance.
For those who are collecting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-producing procedures, caring or transporting them, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles facial shields, chongas and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, only those involved in direct care are the means to allow people to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, only to use the PPE required for specific work, to coordinate the use of the PPE and the inspection of the PPE supply chain, without removing multiple patients with the same diagnosis.

Remittance Date/Time: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: No rights reserved
This month we have extraordinary circumstances around us.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made our responsibilities clear to all human beings in the world and to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, mutual cooperation, and community development, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of camaraderie we have seen among all our co-workers on email, call and chat proves exceptionally well that we have had the privilege of working with extraordinary human beings.
I am so grateful and proud to have you all as co-workers that I can't put into words.
Last week, a man shared his work with me.
She reminded me of how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful it is to be available online and for all.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites running or the source of our co-workers' salaries or keep our communities safe.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and now it is the most needed.
This is a moment in which our work, and our way of doing it, will have a meaningful impact on both worlds.
Due to the importance of this mission, and your role in it, we are going to make some remarkable changes in the way we work with you this coming week.
Changes in our work and time-frames
As Robin pointed out earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our methodology and prepare a timetable for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered the appropriate response to our thinking on the situation before us, and the best way to maintain the continuity of the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to relieve stress and cooperate with our mission for a long time.
If you have to reduce your work, there is nothing wrong with it.
For all staff, contractors, and contract personnel:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We're not declaring a holiday - if you're able to work more than normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is unpredictable at this time, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries, or go to the doctor, your skill set is our priority.
We are not counting your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
We don’t have to say that, but we’re saying it.
There is no need for a sick leave or PTO – just tell your manager and help your team modify the calendar and timetable to ensure that the main area of work is seen by someone.
(If you have been confirmed to have COVID-19, please tell T&amp;C Ops' Brian to help you and ensure that appropriate attention is paid to your situation from the management.)
The hourly employees will get a full salary.
We have already said, and we are once again reaffirming our commitment to fulfill our promises made to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will get salary based on his normal working hours during normal circumstances.
Even if you are sick and can't work, you will get paid.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way to give out the stress associated with the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely satisfying, especially at such a time.
Once again, taking care of yourself is the most important thing.
We want you to talk to your manager so that we know what to expect, and then we can change accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we can't stop.
SRE, HR ops, trust and security, and grant accumulation teams (and others) perform extremely important tasks that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the existing objectives and to focus our attention on collaborating on the essentials for our mission
We all have a lot to do, we will all just focus on the most needed projects.
By reducing the speed right now, we will avoid injury later.
We have no plans to "give twice as much time to heal" after the global pandemic has passed.
Now you will not be expected to work extra hours to meet the deadlines that have gone beyond reality.
We believe that circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new goals and deadlines where appropriate.
What's going to happen with the annual plan?
In order to adjust to our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we would like to reshape the deadline to meet our 2020-2021 annual plan.
We intend to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allows us more time to budget, so that employees can prioritise their over-important work, self-care, and care for loved ones, and accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced timetable for the coming weeks.
This extension of the time-frame will bring about a good reduction in our current planning workload and pressure throughout the organization.
We will put our proposal before the board of directors next week and as soon as we get confirmation, we will inform the representatives and teams about the next steps.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office position, contact, and cleaning
Last week we found out that one of our SF-based colleagues has probably come into contact with the COVID-19 virus.
However, with a lot of caution, we deployed antiviral cleaning personnel to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
He infected every surface from the anti-viral solution of the hospital-grade, to the lobby, and the elevator bank coming to our floor.
The building is implementing its own care-duty protocol using products that support the safety of its residents.
We are confident that the office will be ready when we return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork that has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members located at DC.
Last week, our DC office had adopted a completely remote system in line with the guidance shared from San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, there is also talk of hiring a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but there may be delays.
Some of our co-workers are working from home/away for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working from home/away from home for a long time know that it will require adjustments, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the time of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours of aging.
If more long sessions are needed, consider splitting them into several days.
Define the meetings clearly, keep the agenda ready, and send reading materials in advance.
Make the video your default option with the help of tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and combination.
Take initiatives to facilitate every meeting, monitor chats for questions and account for the speaker list, and help a person take notes (or take notes from mutual cooperation)
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to Tech Support.
Make use of your health insurance for short-term care.
Join the <0x23>remotes channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is investigating webinar-based labour productivity guidance to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded public programs, such as Editathon, etc., until the WHO announces the end of the global pandemic.
We told them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to carry out their mutual grant activities, and that no one will be penalized for being constrained to delay or modify those goals.
In the coming week, we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimedia and other regional and topical community conferences.
This barrier creates a sense of sadness in the entire global community, but at the same time they feel relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, on Wikipedia and otherwise.
Moving forward, CRT is working to organize a page on Met-Wiki aimed at monitoring the impact and providing a place for the community to follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact with COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are together in these situations and are there to help as much as possible.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information from this email on Office Wiki, and all other necessary COVID-19 related information.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries at this time.
If you have something to ask about travel, programs, a major workstation, or coverage-related challenge, or you need help with anything else, please feel free to inform and work with CRT.
We are here to provide assistance and help establish relationships as needed.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please send an email to Brian Juden, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandonment of our functions and responsibilities.
Rather, they recognize that at this time, our work and obligations are likely to need to be adapted in a way we have never done in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to act, provide our activities with the support they need, and provide the service the world relies on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
At the moment, it's time to support each other, and make room for important work to come in the coming weeks and possibly the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible, and so we want all of you to take care of yourself and your families, so that you can be at your best level when needed.
Now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doren D, Gregory V, Jamie V, Joel L, Linnet L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jamie V, Jenin U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activation of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as an entry point in cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metloenzyme located on the surface of the intrinsic and other cells.
ACE2 proteins contain N-terminal peptides M2 domain and C-terminal colectrin renal amino acid conductive domains.
ACE2 is a one-time crossover type I membrane protein with an unexplored enzyme actively active domain on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is decomposed from the membrane domain by other enzymes called sheds, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually emitted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the cell membranes of the lung type II airborne cells, the entropy of the small intestine, the intestinal and veins of the arteries and most organs.
The appearance of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the brain vascular, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain column.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as the genius of ACE.
ACE decomposes the angiotensin I hormones into the aerosol angiotensin II.
ACE2 then decomposes carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and makes it carrier-extensive angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val).
ACE2 can also decompose a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-braedicin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and gralin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the indifferent amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and its role has been reported in the Hartnup disease.
As a membrane protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry point in cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, connecting to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2's corrosive S1 protein leads to the transfer of both viruses and enzymes to endocytosis and endosoms located within cells.
This admission process also requires the inflammation of S protein by the Nutrient Serine Proteas TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under current investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to speculate that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infection.
However, many professional institutions and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
The systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared with controls.”
At the same time, “the risk of pneumonia in patients treated with ACE inhibitors was also reduced, which were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially in people with trauma and heart failure.”
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in mortality associated with pneumonia, although the results were less predominant than the overall risk of pneumonia.”
The recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a new therapy for acute lung damage, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pig babies with lipolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the beginning of the action is 30 minutes with a 24-hour impact process (period).
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulating angiotensin II increases. Acute respiratory distress syndrome has been evaluated for fusion rACE2 in clinical trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to assist in contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in certain areas and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the app users' geographical location.
In the less introductory option, one involves the use of Bluetooth signals to log closer to one user's other cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would directly integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps in their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has employed an app in combination with Alipay, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app "StopKorona" to detect contact with potentially infected individuals and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, this app was waiting for approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for planning within weeks. A similar app ("StopCovid") has also been employed in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, which is designed to ensure they don't get out of the house.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positive cases and a potential lack of effectiveness if the app's use is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited only to "official" or otherwise reputable organizations to determine what types of organizations might include apps related to coronavirus in its App Store.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed after this threat has gone through.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement for borders on such surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions on government projects:
The monitoring must be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
There should be a closing section for expansions of supervision and monitoring;
The use of the data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and shown protected on the basis of proof;
Digital surveillance should be avoided to promote discrimination and the right to self-determination;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
There should be measures to protect the rights of citizens to respond to abuse and abuse;
“Serious participation” will be required by all “relevant stakeholders”, including public health experts and unprivileged groups. The German Caos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohn Grengen) (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The purpose of the proposed Google/Apple plan is to solve the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating system when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking rather than apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrefined location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy-protection systems have been created that only use central servers for interpersonal communication (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to conduct contact tracing in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notifications through text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through many applications and websites. Many countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy-protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, these details were not yet released.
Privacy-protection contact tracing with a large body of research literature has been a well-established concept since at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) to log in close proximity to one user’s other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinating effort that includes both centralized and decentralized methods, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-protection proximity tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, former contact event number, CEN) and other privacy sensitive protocols for contact trays.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never goes out of the device, and all matches are on the device.
The Privacy Group in the MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protection techniques when collecting and using space or path-transfer data for tracking the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the white paper "Apps Gon Rog: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" released in March 2020. A similar effort is SafeTrace by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology, which was originally set up at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was established by groups that were essentially organized in the context of similar approaches and large-scale similar protocols aimed at reducing fragmentation, and enabling the global interoperability of tracing and warning apps, which was an important aspect of achieving comprehensive adaptation.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has opened-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, companies that control Google and Apple, Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy-protective cryptography.
He also published the specifications of the main techniques used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is expected to be made available in three stages:
Providing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-protection coronavirus tracing apps
This functionality is directly integrated into iOS and Android.
Medication reuse (also known as drug reuse, reprofiling, re-appointment or therapeutic change), is the re-use of an approved drug for the treatment of a different disease or medical condition than for which it was originally developed.
It is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directives include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion related to health benefits. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 target proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of those binding sites provides the appropriate project of developing an effective antiviral drug to protect against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are Papen-equal proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, S proteins, and ADP ribophosphates.
Hussain and others studied several candidate compounds, which then adapted and analysed for their mold similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective SARS-CoV-2 anti-seizure drug in a pre-clinical study recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used to protect against certain self-immune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine will be among the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State's chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine trials will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's process of clinical trials and is only authorized under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Big studies are going on at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed Favipiravir to be "clearly effective."
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days for 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted on 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of patients received favipiravir and half received Omifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of the drug is very low and early.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its reserves, and the military would use the drug to deliver it to university hospitals, where the drug would be used for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug. This drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, where the virus has already been multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A combination of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, a study of Lopinavir/ Ritonavir (caletra), concluded that "no benefits were seen".
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding it with proteases.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the proteas of SARS-CoV-2. There have been criticisms within the scientific community about directing resources for the re-purpose of drugs that develop specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Syncses as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Syncs later discovered that Remdesivir had artificial ambient antiviral activation to protect against multiple philosophies-, pneumonia-, paramico- and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more serious disease and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-test studies show that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two tests conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and another for those with more severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalization and critically ill people with COVID-19; two controlled placebos (in China, Canada) and one without control (in Italy).
The state of New York began testing for antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), is planning a clinical trial for an end-respiratory corticosteroid for asthma, Tzigens Elvesco (Sclesodine), for the treatment of patients with pre-existing conditions before symptoms appear with Novel Coronavirus.
A Phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway with 200 patients admitted from serious, hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
A study called COLCORONA is recruiting 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are experiencing mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Many anti-scandals are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular heparin is being widely used to treat patients, due to which the Italian drug agency has published guidelines on its use.
A multi-disciplinary study on 300 patients researching the use of anoxapirin sodium on preventative and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the re-purpose of approved anti-viral drugs that were developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Rebavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per guidelines of Chinese 7th edition
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially reusable as COVID-19 treatments are:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Testing also in Italy and China. And see Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it is not expected to be available in less than 18 months of a vaccine for protection from SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread across the world in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop the vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines for protection from SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative's imperatives for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, mass planning and global learning.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the start of 2020 to create an effective vaccine for protection against COVID-19.
Advanced major platform goals in Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral Vector (Step I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute, and 37 others are declared, but less public information is available (designed or envisaged in planning).
Initial safety and immunogenicity tests are carried out in a Phase I-II test, it is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and performed at multiple sites while determining more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, with a control group monitoring adverse effects at optimal doses, and testing the effectiveness of vaccines for disease prevention.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020, 74 were still not in human evaluation (still in “preclinical” research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was examining the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to induce an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced to start work on a vaccine aimed at launching human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
Around 29 January 2020, the Yansen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanek Shutemaker, announced that it has begun work on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Waxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent Biosolves announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the Romanian laboratory Oncogen published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technology used for cancer neoantigen immunization therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that he had finalised the synthesis of the vaccine and is starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, Nugenerex Immuno-Oncology, a Generex subsidiary, announced that they are launching a vaccine project to create a live-key peptide vaccine for protection from COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, Western Maryland announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was in the development and manufacture of the vaccine.
Novavax will work with Inc.
The partners announced plans for prenatal testing and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 vendors, and that it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine even on an expeditious route.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles under partial financing from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, which is planned for human testing for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered Curvec a "large sum for special access to the COVID-19 vaccine" against which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is currently in pre-clinical testing, whose clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, an Italian biotechnology company, Taquis Biotech, announced that they would have prenatal test results in April 2020 and that tests on their final vaccine candidate could be started by autumn.
On 19 March 2020, in France, The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US<0x24>4.9 million in the COVID-19 Vaccine Research Association, including the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Viena, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which invests CEPI's total US<0x24>29 million in COVID-19 vaccine development.
Other investment partners of CEPI for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curvec, Innovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists have started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-enhancing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
This vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C<0x24>275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to protect against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used when other coronavirus outbreaks occur, with plans to set up a C<0x24>192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the testing of a potential COVID-19 vaccine PittCoVac in mice, stating that "MNA-provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines had [in mice] triggered antigen-specific antibody reactions [in mice] that began to clear up after 2 weeks of vaccinations."
On 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophage, DNA will be designed to replicate inside the human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities in conjunction with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google deposited resources for learning from IBM to supercomputers.
Some vaccines have asymmetric effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have additional benefits for the disease that they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is asking 4,170 health workers to be recruited.
It is possible that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research assessing the efficacy of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate the need for bio-safety level 3 prevention measures to deal with living viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested for safety from SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no certified vaccine for protection from MERS.
When MERS was widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful blueprint for developing vaccines and treatments to protect against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-VERV.
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy, claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually around five days, but it can also last from two to fourteen days.
Although symptoms are mild in most cases, in some cases viral pneumonia and multi-angular failure develop.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads among people during close contact, often through small drops generated by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these droplets arise when inhaling, they usually fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than being contagious in long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a dirty surface and later touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the phasing of a nasal cavity.
It is recommended to use masks for those who suspect they are infected with the virus and also for their caregivers.
The recommendations for the use of masks by the general public are varied, some authorities recommend not to use them, some recommend their use, and others make their use necessary.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be symptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathing bloating.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blue of face or lips; it is advisable to seek immediate medical care when these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, symptoms of upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, nasal flow, or sore throat can be seen.
Symptoms of gastritis such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are seen in different percentages.
In some cases in China, initially only chest tightness and sharp beatings were seen.
In some cases, the disease can increase to pneumonia, multi-angular failure, and death.
This is called the period of incubation.
The emergence period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can last from two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Information shows that symptoms do not develop in all undernourished individuals.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and are being studied, about which the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began incorporating asymptomatic cases into its daily cases on April 1; 130 (78%) of the 166 infections that day were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mucus and saliva can contain a large amount of viral content.
Talking in a loud voice leads to more droplets than talking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that uncluttered coughs can cause droplets that go up to 4.5 metres (15 ft).
Although the virus is not airborne in general, the National Academy of Sciences has reported that bioeurosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors engaged in corridors outside people's rooms came positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as duct penetration and heart pulmonary therapy (CPR) can lead to aerosols from respiratory secretions and thus airborne proliferation.
Although there are concerns that it can spread through the feces, this risk is considered to be low. This virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although the spread is possible before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other individuals. The virus lives on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on cardboard, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on 99% copper.
Even then, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
If used correctly, soaps and antimalarials are also effective; soap products deactivate these by disintegrating the fatty protective layer of viruses, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other slurry, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study by Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization began.
Of the five patients, the first sample showed the highest viral amount, and the sixth patient showed the highest amount of viral on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the respective coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 as the viruses reach the nutrient cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in lung type II inflammatory cells.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called "peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the nutrient cell.
In Wuhan, China, 12% of hospitalized people were found to have acute heart damage and it is more common in severe disease.
During the progression of the disease, rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to somatic reflexive reactions and disorders of the immune system, but acute myocardial damage can also be related to ACE2 clients in the heart.
ACE2 receptors appear highly in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
High prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and Venus thromboembolism (25%) has been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, which may be related to poor disease diagnosis. Bodies of people who died from COVID-19 are deformed airborne damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-contaminated externalities found in tests.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a resonance to the ACE2-promoting epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of somatic hyperventilation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secretary T-cells were shown to be correlated with the selection of irritable IL-6-sprake monocytes in COVID-19 patients and severe lung disease.
Lymphocytic external substances have also been reported in the autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by a nasal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples to be taken within a two-week interval and the immediate value of the results is low.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether a person was previously infected) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience with testing has shown that purity is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the U.S. approved the first care-of-place test on 21 March 2020 for use later that month. The clinical guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University explained ways to detect infection based on clinical facilities and epidemic risk.
Bilateral multi-layered ground-glass ambiguities with a peripheral, asymptomatic and posterior distribution are common in the initial infection.
Subpolar dominance, crazie paving (the thickening of the walls covered with variable aerosol fillers), and denseness may appear when the disease grows.
Fewer statistics are available about the over-substantial wounds and disease body action of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings obtained from the autopsy are:
Macroscopy:Shothe in the lung casing, pericarditis, denseness of the lungs and pulmonary shock
Four types of seriousness of viral pneumonia can be seen:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary shock, pneumocyte overgrowth, large unripe pneumocytes, intracellular inflammation with lymphocytic intestinal intestinal tract and multi-center giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: Diagonal aerosol damage (DAD) with diagonal aerosol leakage.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe short- oxidative stress.
Treatment of pneumonia: Management of leakages and pulmonary intramuscular fibrosis in the aircosive cavity
Blood: transmitted intravenous sclerosis (DIC); leukocyrithroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently and for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings from clothes in public systems to limit transmission by partially eccentric individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with infected individuals with large groups, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public gatherings.
The distance-making guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There is no drug known to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected until at least 2021, an important part of the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, which is called "reducing the cycle."
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty, before eating and after spraying, coughing or sneezing their noses.
Additionally, it recommends using alcohol-based hand bleachers with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where commercial hand bleachers are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial action arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand sterilization."
Glycerol is mixed as a humidifier.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and providing support to other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Assistive treatments can be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to look after those hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the US, Intensivists and pulmonologists have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies to a free source, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 available.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care systems, when procedures that produce aerosols such as duct penetration or hand sanitiser are carried out.
For health workers taking care of individuals infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions in addition to keeping the person in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). The CDC outlines guidelines for use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE choker, respirator or face mask, eye protection equipment, and therapeutic gloves. When available, the respirators (rather than face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial arrangements, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness towards a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-approved experiments.
The CDC recommends using facial shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks when masks are not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical ventilation or other options, but some percentage of cases require.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalizations, with some evidence that duct penetration with high flow nasal penetration or bi-level positive airway pressure can be avoided.
Whether one of these two offers the same benefits to severely ill people is not known.
Some practitioners prefer to use the enteric mechanical swab when available as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal penetration. Serious cases are most common in older adults (over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, limiting the ability of a health system to handle a sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were recruited in intensive care units, 2.3% were in need of mechanical support for the ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have finally been admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and it becomes increasingly difficult to provide oxygen.
The pressure control systems and high PEEP-enabled ventilators are required to maximise oxygen distribution while minimizing the loss of the lungs attached to the ventilator and the risk of pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may develop by 2021, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in the progressive test.
An attempt to give antiviral medication may be made in people with severe disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends volunteers to participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary permission to health-beneficial plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where there is a serious or immediate threat to a person’s life.
No clinical studies have been conducted to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
China launched a mobile app in February 2020 to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app is able to detect the potential risk of infection by detecting 'near contact' using surveillance data.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If the potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also alerts local health authorities. Large data analyses for cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to trace infected people and people they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who come in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone location data jointly with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to prevent the spread of the virus and research.
Russia employed facial recognition technology to detect the violators of the quarantine.
Italian regional health commissioner Julio Galera said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving in some way".
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called for a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience distress due to fear of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or self-infection.
"The rising social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and an economic downturn is an ideal storm that harms people's mental health and well-being," the BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying.
Other common upper respiratory tract diseases such as common colds may have a mild process with or without some symptoms.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while cases with severe or severe diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on statistics from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but there is a decrease in statistics for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
Among the most severely affected, COVID-19 can develop rapidly in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, paternity trauma, or multi-angular failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal sclerosis and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Scandal abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while 4% of this group see abnormal kidney function.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 exhibit an increase in liver enzymes (transiminescence).
According to the same information, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had an average time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In one study of early cases, the average time from displaying early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate among women was 1.7%.
The tissue pathology examinations of the lung samples of the dead body-tests show diagonal aerosol damage with cellular fibromexoid leakages in both the lungs.
In pneumocytes, cell pathologies caused by viral changes were observed.
The picture of the lungs appeared to be similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by high levels of troponin or stopping heart rate.
According to U.S. March statistics, 89% of people hospitalized had pre-existing conditions. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of an area can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to those regional differences and also due to system-related difficulties.
The mortality rate may be higher due to a lower count of mild cases.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases in the past may mean that the present mortality has been underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and almost 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been expressed about long-term pathogen symptoms of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% drop in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans expressed organ damage.
It can also cause the syndrome after intensive care after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether the previous infection provided effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as a potential depending on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of positive testing for coronavirus have been reported on a later date after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are thought to be worse than a re-infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be of an animal origin that is transmitted from natural to human through infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely caused by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the earliest date of the onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The WHO's official publications reported the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
A number of measures are commonly used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary according to region and time and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, the treatment options, the timing from the initial outbreak, and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the WHO prescribed the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the laboratory and the disease code U07.2 for deaths without the laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 without clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19. The death-case ratio determined the number of deaths within a certain time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality ratio as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The number varies by region. Other measures include Case Mortality Rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of persons diagnosed with a disease, and the Transition Mortality Rate (IFR) that reflects the percentage (reported and not diagnosed) of persons who died from a disease.
These data are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case recovery.
Although not all infected people develop immunity, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the center of the outbreak in Italy, Castigli<0xC3><0xB3>n d'Aida, in a small village of 4600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and among young people, which reduced relatively mortality, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been formally classified.
In addition, the German health system is not excruciating.
In the Netherlands, blood donors can be immunized in about 3%, according to evaluations.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate varies for men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have higher mortality rates in men.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only less than 90 years old.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this sex-intestinal are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be a cause.
Gender-based immune differences, low prevalence of smoking in women, and developing co-morbid conditions in men such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not tracking gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reported that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 means the year when the outbreak was first identified i.e. December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), species of animals or group of people, which are in line with international recommendations for naming for the purpose of preventing degradation. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV as interim names for the virus and disease of acute respiratory disease, which complies with 2015 guidelines for not using places in disease and virus names.
The formal names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing parts of health materials such as Nasika Phah and ventilators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed ventilate valves, and the supplier was unable to provide the required time-frame, a local startup printed the required 100 valves overnight by reverse-engineering.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy, misinformation and misleading information about the origin, level, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no medication or vaccine approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "Solidity Trial" to assess the treatment effects of the four existing antiviral compounds with the highest expectation of efficacy.
There is no vaccine available at the moment, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Past work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being examined.
First, researchers aim to build a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a quick immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
Another strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to some sub-species of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-containing proteins that help the virus penetrate into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique of making vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies will have to be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the disease-producing virus. Antibody-dependent growth has been described as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted till April 2020.
Seven tests were already evaluating approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Set to be notified by the end of April, with nine phase III trials on Remdesivir in many countries, most Chinese researches are working on repurposed antiviral drugs.
As of April 2020, there was a dynamic review of the clinical development for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon Beta combined with Lopinavir/Lopinavir.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence is available for the efficacy of Remdesivir.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with non-approved use of Remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the U.S., China and Italy. The chloroquine already used for the treatment of malaria was studied in February 2020 with initial results in China.
However, an equivalent review of the research has been called for.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, noting that twice as much doses are extremely dangerous and can be life-threatening.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use permit for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. Guidelines for the Chinese 7th edition also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use for protection from COVID-19.
Initial statistics indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the suppression of artificially-environmental SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further studies in organisms after showing low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early prick protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), required for SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with ACE2 receptors.
There are major limitations of studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, which have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Osltamivir does not harm artificially eccentric SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in its COVID-19 treatment.
Increasing the amount of cytokine in the later stages of severe COVID-19 can be a complication.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties preventing the increase in the amount of cytokine. Tokilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a short study was completed.
It is undergoing phase 2 non randomized testing at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify an increase in the amount of cytokine, it aims to cope with such aging, which is thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
Interleukin-6 receptive immunity was approved by the FDA in 2017, for a different reason, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome inspired by CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of pure and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccination method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS with undesirable results.
Viral apathy is the expected mechanism by which passive antibody therapy can mediate protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using built-in monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of health-beneficial serum, which contains a liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and is specific to this virus, can be increased for rapid planning.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a physician at the central hospital in Wuhan, who tested positive for COVID-19 and died after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
