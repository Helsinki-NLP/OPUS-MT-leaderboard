A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are grappling with a lack of money to improve the collapsed highway system, many are looking for a solution in a small black box that fits neatly on your car's dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by a motorist and transmits that information to authorities, has now become a contentious issue for Washington and the State Planning Office to revive the old system to finance America's major roads.
Generally, boring work like highway planning has suddenly become an issue of intense debate and vibrant alliances.
Keeping details of the miles you drive, and possibly the location you’ve driven — and then using this information to prepare a tax bill — has got along with Libertarian environmental groups to raise support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The Tea Party is abysmal.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can go into a system in the next decade, in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is a really important thing for our country.
"It's not a matter of choosing or not being chosen by us," said Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, who plans to start tracking every mile decided by motor-drivers in California by 2025.
The way we pay taxes is going to change.
There is technology to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund has almost gone bankrupt, which is financed by paying taxes on gas pumps by U.S. citizens.
The U.S. doesn't buy as much gas as it used to be.
The car now runs more miles in a gallon of gas than ever before.
Federal taxes have not increased in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians refrain from raising even a penny in taxes.
Transport policy expert Lee Munik, at the University of Minnesota, says, “Gas is not at all sustainable.”
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test a per-mile payment system.
He says, “In the long run it will serve as the most logical option.”
Winx is called a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea seems to be good to urban liberals, as it can, for example, change taxes to change the way cars run, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
California planners are keen on this system while they are developing strategies to meet the targets set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (A-PA) also considers the black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors in the Region Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at Region, said, “This is not the only tax that is going into the blind well.”
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries, who in their 2011 report graced moving towards a per-mile payment from Congress.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a <0x24>90 million test project that would have involved 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural lawmakers who were representing persons who had to walk too many miles to go to work or to go to the city on a daily basis, the leadership of the House put an end to that proposal.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction themselves.
It has the most interested Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay a mileage fee instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the initial testing.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
The I-95 alliance, which includes 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along with the Eastern Seaboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported in all places.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers some time ago, the drivers were too impatient to think that the government could monitor each of their steps.
Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management in the Nevada Transport Department, says, “The concern about the Big Brother and other similar things was the major problem.”
It’s not what people wanted.
As the trial progressed, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website: "It will be fairly easy to convert these devices to a full tracking device."
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanageable technology infrastructure that has to be naturally spread to keep a record of every person's daily movement.
Nevada is one of many states that is making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get details of how many miles a day the car is running, but not where and at what time it is running.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The discovery of this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was attempting to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But the device that it is testing was well received by highway planners, as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modem at certain time intervals.
“If you don’t track people’s speed and their location, they’ll be more inclined to adopt this method,” said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programmes of the state.
There are also less expensive and less messy ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are using different options to give drivers.
They can choose the device of the GPS with or without the GPS.
Or again one can choose not to take any devices, but rather choose to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles to be decided by the residents of the state.
Other locations hope that this retention can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience rather than less in the device.
In New York City, transport officials are attempting to develop a taxiing device that will also have the facility to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay according to your drive" insurance, and create a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that can be used to avoid motor-driver traffic.
As mentioned in the city planning document, “Motor-drivers will be attracted to participation in it due to the benefits it receives from it.”
However, some transport planners wonder that perhaps all the discussion on payments according to miles is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that Congress can deal with the insolvency highway trust fund problem very easily by increasing gas tax.
Drivers of hybrids or other cars may also be charged an additional one-time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their fair share.
Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission's Legislative and Public Affairs, said, "What is the need for radical surgery when aspirin can work?"
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died due to drowning.
However, his friend has been detained by the police on charges of concealing the belongings of the deceased with him.
The police have submitted the final report of the death investigation in the court.
On August 26, police recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum river.
His family members had accused his friends of killing him as his mobile and other belongings were missing.
In the report, police said the phone and SIM of the deceased were examined and found that her phone was being used by a woman in Soura.
During interrogation, the woman said that the phone was given to her by one of her relatives, Rohail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in Padshahi Bagh and was a friend of late Zahid.
On August 25, Ruhail went to Jhelum with Zahid after Namaz-e-Jumma.
Zahid opened his clothes and put all the stuff on the side, while Ruhail went on the other side to smoke cigarettes.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhail searched for Zahid, but he could not find him.
He picked up his mobile phone, watch and other items and kept them for his use.
He didn't tell anyone that he had drowned.
The police told the court that Zahid died due to drowning and it was confirmed in the postmortem.
However, Rohail has been taken into custody under Section 404 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for concealing facts and belongings of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, has secretly married a 28-year-old girl.
This was revealed by his family friend, Martha Polanco.
Berlusconi, a three-time prime minister, has married former TV anchor Francisco Pascal in his private chapel.
Francesca met Baluskoni when she was a teens activist at the Forza Italia party.
It is also Francesca, whose relationship was said to have shown that her relationship with Balruskoni is just a show-off.
Berlusconi's close friend and bunga-bunga girl, Martha Polanco, has revealed that she was also invited to this secret wedding.
The event took place three weeks ago.
Asked about what would happen if the two got married, Polanco said they were already married.
It was not a public event.
The wedding took place at a private chapel in the former prime minister's house.
Nothing else can be said.
However, she did not attend the wedding.
He has sent his congratulations to Navjot.
The couple got married about three weeks ago on October 8 or 9.
About eight months ago, a 28-year-old woman, 50 years younger than her, got engaged to Francesca Pascal.
In order to avoid Kirkiri, Berlusconi had founded loneliness behind his decision.
Rain continued to lash the low-lying areas.
With this, cold wave has started in the entire plaint.
The minimum temperature was recorded at 4.8 degrees Celsius in Srinagar, minus 0.2 degrees Celsius in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the state.
Meanwhile, the Srinagar-Leh national highway has been closed for traffic due to heavy rains and snowfall.
There has been heavy snowfall on the Jojila Pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of this season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activity of western disturbances, snow and rain started in the higher hills of the plaintiff in the early hours of the morning, which continued till late evening.
Normal life was also affected by the cold.
People were staying at home to avoid the cold.
Meanwhile, power supply was disrupted in several areas.
Srinagar recorded a maximum temperature of 13.7 degrees Celsius, four notches below normal.
In Jammu too, the night temperature has increased due to heavy rain in the early hours of the morning.
The minimum temperature in Jammu was 16.6 degrees Celsius and the maximum was 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of western disturbances has come down and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lotts, director of the Srinagar-based Meteorological Department, the weather is likely to remain dry in the plaint from November 1 to November 7.
Asaram, who is lodged in jail on charges of sexual harassment, was again disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage, Asaram is being presented as a blood-drinking dracula of children, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
A bench headed by Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop reporting about Asaram, saying it had seen every word reported in the media and found no reason to interfere.
How can we stop them when they are receiving information from the police and others?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of spreading rumours about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They file a case against whom, but the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying they have more options.
Earlier, the court had rejected Asaram's demand for a ban on media coverage.
Officials in the department claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case ever.
The group operator of the mall deducted TDS and paid to the financial institutions concerned but did not pay it in the government exchequer.
In doing so, TDS kept depositing the money to itself.
The group, which came from Mumbai on October 17, was taken up with the Jaipur investigation team.
During the investigation, it was found that the trader had deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
That's why the TDS team launched an income tax survey on the group on Thursday.
About 15 days ago, the group of mall operators was raided and surveyed.
Aggrieved by the action, the businessman has made it clear to the Income Tax Department officials that he is not yet ready to pay the TDS to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax department is continuously targeting them.
Officials investigating the matter have made it clear that recovery action will be taken by sealing the account in case of non-payment.
In view of Diwali, the demand for sweets increases.
As a result, the sales of counterfeit and counterfeit goods are on the rise.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more bright, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched a campaign against fake mava and chemical sweets.
The department seized 70,000 mwa from Madhya Pradesh and 5,000 tsp from Quetta Colony.
With the increase in demand for sweets in the market, the demand for substandard mave from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department received the information of bringing Ghatia Mave from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
The traffic jam is being diverted to Nagpur.
The department took possession of the mave, which was priced at Rs 70,000.
Fear of action has not allowed anyone to be on the ground.
The department considered it as an unclaimed property and destroyed it.
The department raided the Jeetendra caterers in Quetta Colony and recovered around Rs 5,000 from them.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to brighten the skin and last longer.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S S Deshmukh, joint commissioner of the department, said that the search operation for chemically-contained sweets and substandard and fake mave will continue.
In the next few days, the department has been informed about the operation and speeding up the operation.
The consumption of these sweets can also lead to poisoning.
The department asked the sweet businessmen to make sweets from good milk, mave.
People have been urged to be cautious of fake sweets and mavericks.
He was received by 42 senior BJP leaders at the airport.
Modi is on a visit to Bihar for a BJP-led state visit.
The Samanthana Yatra is an attempt by the BJP to heal the families of those killed in the Patna blasts.
A total of seven blasts took place one after the other during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally in Patna on October 27.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts was to create a stampede during the rally so that more and more people were killed and there was an atmosphere of terror in the state.
The terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The party leaders have been on a tour since Thursday, taking a bone-crush from their village.
On November 5, the ashes of all of them will be flown together in the Ganges in Patna.
As part of this journey, there is a consolation journey.
The main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of those killed in the blasts from 7 am on Saturday and meet their families.
During the meeting, he will also provide a cheque of Rs 5 each to the kin of the deceased.
This financial assistance has already been announced by the BJP.
Emboldened by the stunning win in the last match, India will take on Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
In order to stay in the series after two consecutive ODIs were washed out due to rain, India had to win the Nagpur ODI in any way and their batsmen gave them a record win in a banging performance, giving the team a 2-2 equaliser in the series.
Team India has achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice in the series and once again it will be the responsibility of the batsmen to cross the seams.
The Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and the bigger target is also proving to be a dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form, but Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also have high hopes for the team.
As far as opening is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got an opening pair that is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had a brilliant partnership in opening, giving Virat a chance to play without any pressure.
Virat Kohli's performance at number three is considered to be the future of Sachin Tendulkar.
In fact, many cricket pundits have described him as better than Sachin.
Virat Kohli, who is going to be 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, out of which India have won 16 matches.
His average in chasing the target is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive reliance on these three can also be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj had been flapping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has failed to open his account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can serve as a lifeline for them.
As far as Australia is concerned, his batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with his performance.
They are also demanding that he be included in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia have a good batting line up to number nine.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Vogs and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch have not been able to make any impact in the opening.
Mitchell Johnson's lack of bowling could be a big blow for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly in the series so far, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
BJP National Executive Member and Chief Spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said Pakistan was working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of show-caused peace.
Referring to reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here today that Pakistan was pushing the heel to infiltrate around 2000 terrorists prepared in its training camps.
For this, he will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan has become even more divided after the separatists failed to bring the situation under control by inciting people in Kashmir.
Referring to the separatists' visit to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said ISI chief Lt Gen Zaheer-ul-Islam, Lashkar, Hizb chief Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be aired in 2014.
Pakistan is committed to fulfilling this promise.
The killing of soldiers along the border, suicide attacks in Samba and Hiranagar are part of the same strategy.
Terming the demand to abolish military privileges in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said such things are also anti-people until there is lasting peace in the state.
This gives rise to anti-national elements.
He emphasised that the statements of the leaders of the army, security forces, which are pelting the morale, should be stopped.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. watchdog
Edward Snowden, an American intelligence informant, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to testify to the Parliament in Germany if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond to his actions.
German MP Hans Christian Straw Belle, met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum, to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP, in a letter submitted to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "While the results of my efforts are authentically positive, my government considers the parties - disagreement as change, and offers no defense that is an attempt to criminalize political speech with allegations of bullying."
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believed he could persuade the U.S. government to acquit the international community of criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include spying and theft of government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit online: “Mr Snowden has been willing to talk to German authorities, so we’ll have to find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA claims to have bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oprahman, MP who is the chairman of the parliamentary committee, oversees intelligence. He said that if Mr. Snowden had had the opportunity as a witness to "totally ruin relations with the United States and without bringing them into danger," it should still be taken.
Mr. Straw Belle, an MP from the Green Party of Germany, published a photo of himself with Mr. Snowden on the Twitter feed.
He was on a visit to Russia with two German journalists.
According to former NSA contractor counsel, Snowden is not able to return to Russia if he left Russia.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he would be "safe" there the assurances would be needed, the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he had to leave home for "he faced a tremendous and sustained campaign."
He, however, said the world was "happy and overwhelmed by widespread responses" to his work of political expression.
World citizens, including the United States, as well as high officials, have condemned the revelation of an irresponsible system of comprehensive surveillance of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Foreign airlines to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge <0x24>100 to carry-on luggage for passengers on its aircraft board.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging for a carry-on bag for <0x24>100 and it will charge <0x24>2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday said passengers can keep the entire box.
New carry-on charge is for bags in overhead bins, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said that <0x24>25 will charge if paid in advance, <0x24>100 will have to wait if passengers wait to pay as long as they are at the gate.
Foreign spokesman Kate O'Malley said the <0x24>100 fee is to be achieved to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge it," he said.
The airline began charging for the first and second check bags in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid passenger charges are stuffed as much as they can in carry-on baggage which is stuffed in overhead compartments, which means there is often less space in this compartment.
There is a way to bring down the fee for passengers on board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charges.
It has become increasingly difficult for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find the place of the overhead bin.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline's website will not have to pay for it.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay <0x24>100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line at a Frontier Gate can get a bag free.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure passengers know about the fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee will not start until summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but the airline service prefers them.
They argue that it costs money to handle baggage, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them, however, do not even have a carry-on bag charge.
Spirit Airlines Inc. launched Carrie - On Charge for the first time three years ago, and fellow discounter Alligant Air later.
Along with such a fee, another airline is the Hungarian-based Wizz Air, said airline consultant J. Sorensen, and which tracks add-on fees.
He said Spirit's carry-on fee brings in <0x24>50 million a year, which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former official of Midwest Airlines, recently flew into Spirit and surprised passengers who have faced carry-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was seamless," he said.
I was hoping to grind the teeth and look out at a fight gate.
"The plane was full and he said it climbed lickety-split."
Frontier is also following Spirit's <0x24>2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier suggests that travelers who take soda, or juice can keep the whole box, and this free coffee will only give for once.
It will still remove the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but seven months after passengers complained they retreated and followed after any other main airline was there.
If Frontier's passengers do not purchase directly from the airline then this move of Frontier to charge a fee on Carry-on is its fresh effort to operate customers towards its own website.
Airlines pays online travel seller Orbitz such <0x24>10 to <0x24>25 for each sold ticket.
That's why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those instead of going through an online travel agency.
However, the frontier has moved forward in this area.
In September, many often took flight miles from half to give to customers who bought from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award by up to 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000 mile Frontier Trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It also allows them to choose their seats in advance for the sole passengers on purchase directly from the Frontier website.
The city of Denver in Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home town, but its business is dwindling and it is losing money.
Revenues fell 9 percent and its flight capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republican Airways Holdings Inc.
Republicans are trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sales.
NSA accuses “internal error” instead of hackers for website crashes
The Secret National Security Agency said on Friday that our website had been shut down for a few hours due to some technical shortfalls and not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
"The NSA.gov was not in access for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a pre-determined update," the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved tonight.
It is not true that the claim came to be due to the obstruction, distributed denial of service [DDOS] attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA's website was shut down for at least six hours, and for some users the site is still not in reach.
A NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not even compromised."
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA's website by DDoS attack.
The DDoS attack is designed in such a way that such a large amount of traffic is sent to the target website until the site is closed due to the server being overloaded.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former highly mysterious NSA, which was once nicknamed “No such agency”, has become a subject of much debate and bitter criticism among the general public over the events of foreign and domestic espionage programs over the past months – a secret file by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
Due to such growing controversy about the agency, there were speculations after tonight's incident that the incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
A beautiful expression was presented in line with the story of 'Dronacharya Another', which shows harmony in the Dowpar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's context, a guru is forced to walk the wrong path by tying in what enclosures.
The play was jointly launched by the Chief Guest at the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College, Prabhudayal Valmiki, Cantonment Council vice-president Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh.
The play depicts the similarities between Dronacharya of the Dwarupar era and the circumstances of a professor Arvind at present.
Directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Baisain, Hemant Goel, Seema Samar, Jansidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun, etc., performed with complete justice to the characters.
The play was directed by Jeetendra C. Raj and produced by Hemant Kumar.
Later, various cultural and literary awards were presented to the winners of the event.
The award was given to Dr Aslam Jamshedpuri, president of Urdu department of Charan Singh Vivi, senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla and Rangerjit Singh C Raj.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi among others contributed to the successful conduct of the event.
Bombardier's profits fall as aircraft deliveries fall, orders drop
Canadian airline and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter in its train unit and under pressure by aircraft orders and deliveries on contract issues.
The Montreal-based Bombardier also did not present an update on the issues of release of any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or its ambitious program of moving the aircraft to commercial service from next September.
Nearly one and a half months after the first flight of the test aircraft, it has just flown three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is on track.
The result fell short of the forecast and the stock was sent to the Toronto Stock Exchange for more than 8 percent sliding.
Cameron Dorsey, an analyst with the National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered its rating from "matter" to "field performance" in the stock is limited to the next one or two quarters.
"Weaker aircraft delivery was mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transportation," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier Cseries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, there is no doubt that the market will be skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can now cut it off at the low end of the Boeing and Airbus-dominated market.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
Potential buyers wait for the outcome of the flight test to validate the company's claims about the new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as the definitive order for CSeries is medium to 177.
403 complete orders and commitments are available with operators of 15 customers and K.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target from the time of the first jet commercial use.
The officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was going according to schedule.
"The test aircraft remained on land for a longer time than predicted," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding that the land testing and software update were also scheduled during the interval of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer makes a schedule in a different way.
We decided to make a first flight and make an update period and said what we did.
That's why all this will happen through the flight program.
The second half of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly, the company said.
Still, analysts believe customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said that it evaluated the Service (EIS) schedule in admissions and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slower pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that the service in penetration will be pushed to Q1/15," Dorseyen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to <0x24>147 million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, <0x24>172 million, or 9 cents per share.
The adjusted income per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dipped marginally from <0x24>4.2 billion to <0x24>4.1 billion.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, revenues of 10 cents per share and <0x24>4.56 billion were expected.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter, down from 57 a year ago
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was <0x24>32.9 billion on September 30, no changes since December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the following sequence of intakes and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Baudoin said.
Aerospace revenues fell 13 percent to <0x24>2 billion.
Bombardier said the world's largest train manufacturer, the division had revenues up nearly 11 percent for <0x24>2.1 billion.
Orders in the transport unit were backlogd about <0x24>32.6 billion from September 30, up marginally from December 31.
Some large contracts in the margins of the transport division were also affected by execution issues.
The new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter, the executives said.
Bombardier's shares, which included Google Inc's Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pitchet Board, were also down 8.5 percent at C<0x24>4.83 in mid-afternoon trading on Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest rival to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profits on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
They don't lie to anyone and don't think like stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our minds change and we begin to walk against the rule by putting the ideal aside.
Researchers at Harvard University and David Eccles School of Business at Utto have given a number of interesting facts.
According to the researchers, we prefer moral values without stress in the morning, but due to fatigue or high pressure in the evening, honesty decreases.
The researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell if the point is higher on the left or on the right.
The participants were told that if they would give the wrong answer instead of the right answer, they would be paid.
In this experiment, it was observed that those who were used between 8 am and 12 am did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, while experimenting on people between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles in check.
This led the researchers to prove that the greed of money in the morning does not matter to our honesty, but in the evening we stop paying attention to morality.
The study has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
After the looting, the miscreants fled from the spot.
The injured have been admitted to a hospital in serious condition.
Sohanvir, son of Sunder, a resident of Madhi village, recently retired as an Under Engineer from the power department.
On Wednesday, he was returning home on a bicycle after withdrawing Rs 44,000 from a branch of Syndicate Bank in Bhola.
Two bike-borne miscreants looted cash of Rs 44,000 from the spot on the Bhola-Mari road.
When Sundar protested, the miscreants shot him in the stomach, causing him to be injured.
On being informed, the family members and villagers rushed him to a hospital in critical condition.
No case was registered till the filing of the report.
Three days ago, while returning home from the same bank, Jasveer, a resident of Ammanullahpur, was shot dead by two bike-borne miscreants.
The police have not been able to divulge any further details of the case.
SHO Sumer Singh Yadav claimed that the incidents would be made public soon.
When the hotel staff protested, the assault began.
The son of a drunk MP, along with RK Singh, the younger brother of the hotel owner who came to the rescue, started a scuffle.
In the meantime, many more people came.
When he tried to catch the assailant, he opened fire from the revolver.
The firing spread panic in the area.
The hotel staff caught hold of him and called the police.
The hotel owner, Munna Singh, who reached the police station, lodged a complaint against Anand Pandey, son of Gorakhnath Pandey, a resident of Birwa Paharpur in Koirana police station in Bhadohi district.
The police arrested Anand and seized the revolver.
According to Handia Inspector Ashok Saraswat, a resident of Khabhor in Pratapgarh, Munna Singh runs a hotel called Rag Darbar on National Highway.
At around 8 pm, Anand Pandey reached the hotel and ordered a meal.
When the food was delayed, he started abusing, assaulting and firing.
Anand was drunk and also threatened to kill hotel personnel.
The hotel is located near Bhiti village and is adjacent to Bhadohi district, the inspector said.
Mr. Big Sentenced to Prison for Coke's Advocate Who Provides Secret Information About Police Investigation
42-year-old Basharat Dutta used to inform the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer felt that people could find out about her secretive drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The defence's top lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he feared that people would know about his secret drug addiction, has been jailed for three years.
42-year-old Barasht Ditta, after compromising on his cocaine addiction, provided the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough with sensitive confidential information about his drug trafficking investigations.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash", and was praised as "Top Brief" by criminals, was arrested from his home in 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarborough, which he represented in the previous Narcotics trial.
Authorities had seen 32-year-old Scarborough holding three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
Investigations after Detta's hair, his wallet, and cocaine particles were found in his credit card revealed that Dita A was a "regular user" of the class of drugs.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, she attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and her accomplices.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at the time as part of the main investigation of the Heroine and Coke gangs operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 others in it, who were jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds, and more than 200,000 pounds of cash during several raids.
The 42-year-old Dita used to provide information to criminals, because she feared that people would not know about her cocaine addiction.
Dita, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburnard, was found guilty in two cases of obstructing justice after a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court today.
She had admitted about keeping cocaine at the earlier hearing.
The lawyer's bad times began when the police, while investigating Scarborough, found that he had been in regular contact with Ditta on the phone since February 2011.
The two spies followed the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and carrying a drug containing more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer's bin in the black golf glove.
After taking the drug, Scarborough was in regular contact with Ditta over the phone, who went out for dinner at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium, Eewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that the drug was kept there and there were nine conversations between them.
The court heard that he was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the trial when clues of A-class drug were found on Ditta's hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and said his discussions were a matter of "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Dutta tried to remove a lot of credit cards by taking out his wallet, but he was seized, and his hair was sampled.
In the police interview, she said that she used to run the office from her workplace as well as from her home, and her clients used to call her home for legal matters.
After being told by the arrested main persons what the spies knew about them, the court said in the hearing that Dita used to call the leading people of the narcotic drug supply chain, some of which she had presented before it.
Annie White, on behalf of the prosecution, said: “The criminal lawyer should be best aware of not breaking the law.”
Mr. Dutta is accused of misusing his position as criminal advocate, very much connecting with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of the general drug dealer, but about the dealer who is providing the drug to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal without a doubt, as he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limit of lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible so that they were able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession, but insulting.
He made a lot more close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed the agreement with his freedom.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Le Halsted, Superintendent of Lancashire Police, said: “At the time Mr. Ditta started receiving narcotic drugs from organized criminals, he converted himself from criminal advocate to criminal.”
Due to his cocaine addiction, he compromised heavily and became too weak for the purposes of leading members of organized crime groups who used him to obtain critical information related to police investigations.
Lawyers should maintain the highest standard of integrity, and instill confidence and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this belief and tried to escape under his occupation.
The serious and organized crime unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta, who also found him guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and now disrupting the course of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring the perpetrators to court.
This case should act as a warning to criminals that no person is far from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On her website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about herself, in which she said her fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for a death penalty client in the U.S., to be Muhammad Ali's dinner guest, and to be an inspiration for her work.
Kenya's press outrage over controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying, “This is a terrible place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is it to prevent Parliament from taking away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?”
"The law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM.
He said the new media tribunal would "always be biased, because it is part of the government" and said that the ban on content and advertising would harm Kenya's position in the global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to the M.P. people,” he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will provide the government with "strong control over the media", while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya were "a strong blow" and called the bill "cruel."
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after Islamic gunmen attacked the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media had broadcast security camera footage of handcuffs sent to the scene of the attack, in which they were shown looting the mall with intent, causing officials to become angry with Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimyo had sent summons to two journalists and mediapersons for questioning, although the summons were withdrawn after the media instigated.
Under the new bill, 2 crore Kenyan shillings and 10 lakh Kenyan shillings can be fined and there will be an additional risk of being removed from the list or denied official press approval.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the violator if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a penalty is enough to shake the foundations of most FM stations.”
It also said that these measures could have devastating effects that are described as Kenya's "living blogosphere."
By closing the mouth of the media, politicians know that they can do their own arbitrariness.
Nation journalist Mutuma Mathew describes Kenyan media as a key source of control and balance in public life, writing “no one will ever know.”
He wrote, “If politicians are left behind, they will bankrupt the country and take us back to the era of hunting and hoarding.”
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced the wrath of the people.
In May, he voted in favor of rejecting the cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission, and reinstated about 532,000 shillings per month, tax-free body salary, which is considered to be among the highest in the world.
The birthday of the world's richest Indian Mukesh Ambani's wife is on November 1, but as the night of October 30, the clock struck twelve, the whole Jodhpur started to echo from the birthday of Nita Ambani.
Earlier, the atmosphere of the celebration was completely created by the performance of AR Rahman's team.
In this musical night, starting at 8 pm, Rahman presented his signature songs.
Priyanka Chopra was on the stage for a dance performance.
Nearly 32 charters arrived in Jodhpur for guests to attend Nita Ambani's birthday celebrations.
Due to the reduced parking space at Jodhpur airport, the charter was parked in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars, including BMW and Jugar, were imported.
Sood said the city's sanitation system, street lights have failed completely.
No steps are being taken by the Municipal Corporation and HUDA to run the city centre of Panchkula.
He demanded that Panchkula should be completely removed from the house.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said the city has got new councillors and mayors after the municipal elections, but they do not have the power to get work done.
As a result, the city councilors have become a dummy and the officials are acting according to their own.
Sood said the municipal corporation has crores of rupees but all the money is being collected in the form of FDs in the banks and interest is being charged.
But no steps are being taken to put money on the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of doping ground is the most serious.
Due to the construction of the dumping ground in Sector 23, people living in Ghaggar cross-sectors have been forced to live Narkari life for the last several years.
Municipal officials have been talking about shifting the dumping ground at village Jhuriwala for the last several years, but people in Barwala area are already facing a serious problem of flies.
He said that the condition of health services and education system in the villages has deteriorated.
To date, no work has been started to provide facilities to people in rural areas.
UN sets new targets to tackle poverty
The United Nations is about to immediately embark on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
To replace the MDDs ending in 2015, the Australian diplomat played an important role just before the Sustainable Development Summit that began overnight in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final draft of the document, which will be supported by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that the time has come to "get up above national interests."
“I am very happy that Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process for setting up the Universal Sustainable Development Goals.”
These will be based on our development under the SDG Millennium Development Goals, and will be an integral part of the development framework after 2015.
I will do my best to implement the mandate given to me by our Member States to meet our far-reaching objectives of sustainable development goals based on the success of MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns rise as powerful personalities clash
With a statue of Mozambique's founding President Samora staring down at them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive officer of an investment company.
Frightened about his country's future, he changed his corporate dress from a "we demand security" printed T-shirt in Portugal and joined the crowd of the capital Independence Square on Thursday.
The conflict between government forces and Ray Namo has been reported almost daily for two weeks, more than 20 years after a peace deal was signed.
Ray Namo was once a notorious rebel of the white-ruled Rhodesia and the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.
After the peace agreement of 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have shocked foreign investors and locals.
The bets are high for the fast-growing economy. Some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, Eni could bring in investments of more than <0x24>50bn next year.
The ruling Frelimo party, the major political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the tensions.
Ray Namo says the government launched the latest conflict on October 17 by launching attacks on its members in Sofa La Province, a traditional Ray Namo stronghold,
Government forces attacked Renmo bases and tried to assassinate the group's leader, Fernando Makhang, Ray Namo's spokesman, following an attack on the former rebels.
The government blames Ray Namo for triggering the confrontation, accusing the soldiers of attacking.
President Armando Zebuzhan has called for distrust of concerns about instability.
Mr Zeebuzan told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhaka had seen himself as a "lost" "whatever it is, remains to try to prove its forces that he can enforce his own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Maung was quoted as saying that Ray Namo had cancelled the 1992 peace agreement but later became a matter of concern.
He told FT that the agreement is not being honored by Free Limo
"Our vision is to come back to the negotiating table, but seriously," Mr. Maughan said.
The last talks between the two sides did nothing special to ease the honey tension of a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about the two big men (Gibuzhan and Dhakama) fighting together," said Joseph Han, a lecturer at London Open University and a Mozambique expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators nor are they willing to make concessions.
Ray Namo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said about the boycott of municipal elections scheduled to be held in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to win concessions and economic plunder from the government.
Ray Namo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, formed by a former Ray Namo member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Maung says - who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want to leave the presidency because he doesn't want peace, doesn't want a transparent election," Mr Makhang said.
It is not clear what kind of capacity Ray Namo has, but it has been a major hit and run tour of police stations and vehicles on the north-south highway.
Most of the clashes are in Sofa La Province, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, with host Bera Port which relies on exporting miners, including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
In June, Rio suspended its experiment for nearly a week after threatening to attack the Ray Namo Line.
Whether Ray Namo would be able to replicate this threat was almost upon being asked.
"The things weren't going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community," Mr. Maung said.
The government of instability further ramped up frustrations, says Fernando Lima, the media cop, who heads an independent media company, many are also concerned about corruption, slow growth and the recent floods of kidnappings.
"People have governments and presidents responsible for the country's future, and think they should be one to find solutions to problems," he says.
The Omar Sultanate, an exhibitor, people still need stability.
"No one cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets," he said.
Children should be taught mythology and legends "as a model for a way of the author of life."
Thor's stories could show "there is no combat of subtle tricks in cruel strength," while the meaning of having a dream in the Arthurian legends suggests.
To teach many of the myths even "unfortunately far away, it would not be appropriate to teach it in the wild and in some cases even in obscenity and in schools," Cross Lee Holland advocated one of the appropriate actions of age.
"I find it surprising, in America, that myth and folklore are already a part of education," he said.
I have been doing this as a plan for 20 years.
He has called writers and teachers "more energizing" and it is "a new twist" for children, together with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon as well as the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, said: “You may have a lot of intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writer writing for a child and an adult writer writing for an adult requires some sense of hope.
Everything has to be simplified or come to a happy end, because it is an innate sense of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than said, revealed through a story.
Doesn't show the old base.
CHANDIGARH: Head constable Om Prakash retired after serving for 32 years in the police department in Gwadar.
On the occasion, officials of the police department organised a farewell party.
Om Prakash is a resident of village Bhaparal in Gram Panchayat Bani Bhaparal.
He served better during his tenure.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival
People can argue about the fact that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: about a hundred years ago, comic playwright Frank Fey, who served as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to make jokes directly to people sitting in the crowd in the way of conversation.
Fee's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
The celebration, co-written and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Standup Institute called Carolines, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, including over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolines, and became a huge success, to a level where they became too big to be played at the club,” says Hirsch.
We built this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event included the presence of Vanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes" which included other artists including Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
With the festival expanding, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians participating in this year's celebration have come from non-traditional means, such as coming on small networks like Comedy Centrell, F<0x58>, and Spike.
Nick Crawl reached the leading position from the deep-cable sitcom (F.<0x58>.) with Ronchi Fantasy-Football theme "The League"), and now has his own comedy Central Sketch Show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," although she is best known for her viral video series "Mersel the Shell with Shoes On."
Other young comedians with different voices, including crawls and slates (absolutely disillusioned voiced Anthony Jesselnick, satirical, focused on ethnicity W. Kamau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the most prominent attractions of the celebration will be, an interview: David Steinberg's talking to Larry David:
Steinberg began working as a standup comedian, but he has become a well-known television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, she hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall, in the center of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the DNA of Larry’s all-work comedy,” Steinberg said.
They were telling me that when he was here, sometimes he would go into the street between two buildings and think to himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil continues to fall to <0x24>96 a barrel
The fall in oil prices continued on Friday as a report offset concerns over higher supplies, where the power-hungry manufacturing sector in China is getting stronger.
The benchmark for December delivery was 14 cents down to <0x24>96.24 per barrel in Europe until late morning in electronic trading on the U.S. crude New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 5.8 percent for the month of October, down 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil has weighed on price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
For more than five weeks, supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand increased activity showed that two reports on Chinese manufacturing came on Friday.
This suggests that development could continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after a decline of 7.8 percent in the last quarter from a two-decade to a third quarter.
Brent crude also fell 26 cents from <0x24>108.58 per barrel on the ICE exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude used by U.S. refineries.
The court has blocked the New York Police Department's pause and action on sports policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked the changes and removed the judge from the case, requiring a judge's order for the New York Police Department's pause and sports program.
Justice Shira Shindeller of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 2 & 3 said the verdict will be pending as a result of an appeal by the city.
The judge in the city had ruled in August in violation of the Constitution in the manner it had prevented people from questioning and out of its programme.
The city's police department also includes its policy and its decision to allocate a monitoring to help with the training program change associated with it, its findings and its remedial order appeal.
The appeals court heard arguments on the request on Tuesday.
The appellate court has said that because it compromised the requirement for a judge to avoid the appearance of bias in part of a series of media interviews and the public acted incorrectly by the U.S. judges, so should be removed from the judge's case, the court of statements should be publicly replied to criticise the court.
The judge ruled that police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pauses and sports programme.
She has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and has ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras on some campuses where they are most closed.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police stop.
An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
Rest and sport tactics have been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The pause and play policy has been around for decades in some form, but mostly from black and Hispanic men, from 684330 to 2011 recorded a dramatic increase under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg to a all-time high.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men from all minorities and became a class action case.
Proponents of NYPD's pause and change in the sports program have said that unfair behavior will end up molding a more reliable and effective police force and other police departments can influence the use of the policy.
Opponents say the changes will reduce the morale of the police, but will solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after crime, money wasting and shrinking by thousands of officials over the past decade.
The judge noted that there was no termination for pauses and play, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD stop.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training.
During the seven-day period, all the participants were informed about various Vidyas including Tent Pitching, Flag Pole.
Training is being carried out in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All participants are sharing the spirit of unity by joining the Sarvadharma prayer.
Camp Principal Vipin Kumar State Training Commissioner is giving his special assistance.
Colson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Collson, a former editor of News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about his prowess relationship while he was home secretary of Charles Clark.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis Q.C. told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was meeting his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcare to hack Paulby's voicemail and "keep watch" the male, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Collson, who is currently the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside the house of the people and keep an eye on them, but to put articles before the people, let's see how people react to it."
He said that the NOTW used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face encounters.
The third one was the editor himself.
He knew the other way around, and he knew the other way around.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He says, "No, no, no, no, no, no."
The rumor about Clark's prowess was first introduced by AOTW's feature desk when a source who was sexually interested in Ms. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
In August 2006, from home from Mulcair, Ms. Polby's phone was seized at least three times from voicemail.
Investigators also found such entries in the personal investigator's computer, on which Ms. Polby and her sister were named "Project".
During the period during which he was being examined, an anonymous call was made to Ms. Polby's grandparents and sought information about him.
During the visit, former Chief Reporter Neville Thulbeck and former reporter James Weatherup observed Ms. Polby's visit.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him through a voicemail: "I've got a story we're planning to run tomorrow, about which I would definitely like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Addis said Colson's involvement in the case was in partons with other important individuals, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson had spoken to Mr. Blankett about a provocative relationship with a married woman while he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks who was married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to have sex with other people to hack the phone between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlbeck and WeatherUp have accepted phone hacking.
Promote corporate fear from NSA disclosures about state surveillance.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter landed at the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the rooftop of the US Post Office, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of Lisning Antenna and indicated an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Klepper, director of the US National Intelligence, stressed that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal foreign companies' trade secrets and to increase U.S. companies' international competitiveness or to increase their bottom line" again in September.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has been a whistleblower, began to tell the U.S. surveillance of his secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether the director will follow his or her word.
The US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing that came to mind was that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe’s most powerful individuals can be targeted, certainly business leaders are also targeting potential.
Snowden has made in-depth cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use these data for mutual benefit.
“Germany should wake up,” says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by the German companies' consultancy, the U.S. has almost become a big risk now, like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
Leaked by Mr. Snowden in all documentation, however, there is no evidence to date that the U.S. knew the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of EU internet capabilities and should make efforts to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Hasso Platner, president of the German business software company SAP, said "this is no way."
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he wouldn’t have been allowed to die 20 years ago.
In Germany, everything is subsidized, from coal to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's disclosures about US technical sophistication and espionage access have proved to be a shock to some companies that previously believed China was the biggest surveillance threat.
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing umbrella where European officials are more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and have therefore become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a business organization, some 10 percent of non-US members canceled plans to use an American-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s co-CEO, says: “We saw a new question that customers didn’t come across a year ago — is — is my data said to be stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German authorities argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and data and therefore these must be guarded at all costs.
It's no surprise that financial intelligence is a scam.
It has always happened.
“It’s been a topic for many years, and through fundamental current discussions, nothing has changed,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive of the chemical manufacturer BASF.
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we do too, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defense system and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For big companies, it’s too early to record messages whether it’s unwise to leave a business from home with a usb stick, or leave a laptop unopened in a hotel room to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of Car Maker Audi, says it is a years old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote listening devices
Germany’s BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when smart phones are compromised due to risks on overseas tours.
The prepaid mobile phones were later thrown out.
However, small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, it is the top of many companies in the global market in a special place.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access to personnel and financial resources,” warns BfV in a report.
The US has warned other countries about the economic espionage of its own companies.
According to the France The Washington Post, the name of the US national intelligence in February was named in a second tier of hackers engaged in hacking, with Russia and Israel behind China.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company when it comes to economic espionage, "The French are the worst"
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, explains in the interview: “Services are well known that all countries spy on their allies even if they cooperate in non-terrorist combat.”
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial levels and we do too, because it is in the national interest to defend our business.
No one is stupid.
The parents of a Georgian teenager who was killed in an "unique accident" believe their son was killed
A Georgia teenager whose dead body was found wrapped in a Restling mat at his high school gym believes his son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Valdosta, GA K Kendrick Johnson, was found trapped inside his high school gym on January 11 in a matt standing directly behind the bleachers.
Investigators at the Lands County Sheriff concluded that Johnson had died in a "difficult accident," but the 17-year-old boy's family denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Crump, who submitted to Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "he fully believes that his son has been murdered".
He does not believe in death in the manner stated by the sheriff.
"He believes that this is beyond the logic of physical rules and general intelligence," said Cramp.
They feel that this conclusion, is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
“He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag.”
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mueller said Thursday he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered because of a crime?
Murree said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, they will take us wherever they are.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
“I am of the view that environmental reasons exist for a formal investigation.”
Moore told the reporter that the preliminary autopsy indicated that Johnson's death was as a result of "local respiration."
According to Moore, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death."
"There are a lot of questions that should be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to summon a criminal in connection with Johnson's death or investigate civil rights, he will ask the FBI to do so.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the Londage County Sheriff's Office.
On Wednesday, South Georgia's judge ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they expect video footage to give some indication of how he died.
CDC Issues Guidelines on Allergy of Children for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control food allergies of children in the school.
Such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government for the first time, as the number of school-going children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in every 20 children in the U.S. now has food allergies.
The CDC found that there was an 18% increase in food allergies in children between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children’s food allergies, and how to handle them in case of an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to keep a stock of epinephrine to cope with potentially life-threatening acute arousal (anaphylaxis) - an auto-injector of the epiphane brand that is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily keep stocks of more amount of epinephrine.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say, “It seems like something is pinching my tongue,” “It looks like I have hair on my tongue,” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Choose Their Children’s ‘Linga unspecified’
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize the third gender for babies born with ambiguous genitals.
Newborn children will no longer be referred to men or women in a conservative manner.
According to the new law, parents are not required to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare sex on the birth certificate of the child as “unspecified” or “unspecified”.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can make early sex-specific surgical decisions for newborns, and fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to the B.B.C., an intersex man said years later, “I am neither male nor female.”
I will continue to be a victim of injuries made by doctors.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year have a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that come under investigation of sexual development disorders, a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals (ovaries or testes), or abnormally developed penises.
It may be that Wallis Simpson has been intersex.
Gender identity is still not understood properly, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to specify gender when gender may not be determined and inspect the psychological and physical development of the child before performing surgery, if such a condition occurs.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Drecher, who specializes in gender-identifying cases, said Germany’s new law “appears to be a good thing.”
Intersex children create moral turpitude.
“Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but that’s not the case with most children.”
You can specify gender without surgery, and then see how identity develops.
The science of knowing how a gender will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
It’s a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In a report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people are described as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status does not relate to gender, but rather to its biological composition, which is neither clearly male nor female, but is either a joint form of the two, or neither of them is clearly defined.
These characteristics may exhibit secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and bias crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-conforming gender.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult individuals to mark male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the world's first recognized "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to keep an "unspecified" gender status to life.
According to the Interior Ministry, the German passport will also have the third specification in the form of <0x58> for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighbouring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed petitions for the withdrawal of "sex theory" from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also opposes Germany’s law, saying, “While the world is going to a state where gender itself is a choice, but not sexual activity, we are taking two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction.”
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would love to see the babies being gender-specified at birth.
“Abortion is very stressful without additional limitations, especially if you don’t even know what your child’s gender is,” he said on the website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, babies born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites (aboriginals), in the name of the beautiful Greek deity who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered gender as slate that could be erased and then written.
But now that many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they are understanding that gender-identifying is complex work, and sometimes even mistakes can be made by physicians who don’t know what children will feel about their gender specifics when they grow up.
Dresher says "in the middle of the twentieth century, it was called a "psychological emergency."
When these babies were born, you didn’t call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of John Hopkins University, who considered the penis to be harmonious.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental indications - how parents raise a child - determine by interacting with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as a male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child, whose penis had gone into sex accidentally during sex (circumcision), to give the child a full bond and remove her testicles and raise her as a girl.
“Mani presented that case as a successful case of transition, but that didn’t happen,” Dresher said.
At the age of 15, the child turned back to himself as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresher said that some physicians are still "following the same pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the later years of the year 1990, individuals undergoing these gender surgeries began to appear "not happy with the result."
The same was the case with the 36-year-old author of Montana, Jim Bruce, who was born with an <0x58>Y male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
Physicians did not clearly understand that his penis was small, or that his cockroaches were large, but they were certain that he could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
Therefore, shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and raised as a girl.
She was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, “I knew I wasn’t a girl.”
I wasn’t happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At the age of 18, he was about to have vaginoplasty with him.
But feeling depressed and something messed up, she demanded medical records.
It made him realize the terrible truth.
I was bound at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, causing his genitals not to develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a man back, taking testosterone supplements and removing his breasts.
Due to surgery, he was discharged.
Today, he explains to people about intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project to normalize their perceptions.
But, Annie Tamer-Matis, executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that Germany’s law “invites gossip and stigma.”
“Many activists think that Germany’s law will prompt parents to make quick decisions and assign the child to “undetermined.”
We are afraid that it will encourage intervention.
We think that instead of waiting, specifying male or female gender is a better process.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Matis said his organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be identified in a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal sex.”
The law of Germany is related to specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a battle fought by newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions.
But Dr. Erlin Bartz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany's law would "give strength to both parents and children."
Baratji's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD called full androgen insensitive syndrome.
Since her androgen client had defects, female traits developed in Katy.
His body has a vagina but not a uterus or ovary.
Now 29-year-old Katy is married and resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or a guest surrogacy.
“This law facilitates parents not to take any decision on their own in haste,” Bartz said.
It gives them a proper understanding and time by some test before writing, ‘male’ or ‘female’.
In this way, you stay fine - raise the child, love the child.
You have a sweet baby and enjoy it.
We do not need to undergo surgery in a hurry which cannot be refunded.
“It brings children to the decision-making process and frees parents from the anxiety that motivates them because they don’t believe they are doing well.”
Ultimately, the child will determine which gender he or she is more comfortable with -- and that would be a very good thing.
This enables children to make decisions for themselves.
A legal awareness camp was organised by the Tahsil Legal Services Committee under the chairmanship of Ramnagar committee chairman and Ramnagar sub- judge Sandeep Kaur at the middle school Dalher in Ramnagar.
In which students and others were informed about the right to education and the law for the economically backward.
Advocates ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj and sarpanch were present on the occasion.
A large number of villagers were present on the occasion.
Report: Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, advisers close to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton in place of Biden for Vice President's ticket for 2012.
The most notable explosion in the revelation is the heavy-anticipated 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Helmen, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "widespread group-sessions and late 2011 polling" to find out what dumping Biden could help in Obama's hope of a re-election.
According to the Times National political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides complete information about the main executives' campaign and the bill to name the former White House staff chief, to find out how former state secretary Clinton's change from vice president influences the poll.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago Expedition and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s close advisers – including Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Masina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Palauuffe – were under consideration for the change.
The "Double Down" claims that Dale tried to change Biden despite his personal accomplice before finally making a decision when he was informed that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
“I said looking at the whole scene, and one of them, it was,” Dale told the newspaper.
You remember, when the presidency was in danger at that time, we were in such a situation that, “Holy Christ, what else shall we do?”
While Dale described the research as a "precaution," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made significant investments to find out how much dividend this claim would yield when it was polled.
"The campaign doesn't spend on voting and focused groups like money as long as they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, Halaki, did Obama know his team was looking for a change?
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if his boss knew about the possible reshuffle.
While Dale said he did not think the president was aware of the possible change, the former chief of staff believed it was "possible" that Obama knew.
"Double Down" is certain: will not answer whether a political investigation reached Obama's desk? Martin told more.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama wasn't aware of the Biden dumping ticket research.
"Maybe," Martin said.
Glow-in-the-dark ice cream likes?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glo-in-the-dark ice cream - jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the sea animal to develop the finest breakfast.
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China used chemical sniffing to re-strengthen proteins.
Ice cream will increase the pH level of the protein by reacting with the eater's tongue and the ice cream will glow.
Chris says that ice cream is brightened by the heat of the mouth, that is, the more licky it will be to win.
Charlie, founder of the Lick Me I Am Delicious Ice Cream Company, said: “It’s an incredible thing but early days production will get me about 2 grams of stuff from <0xC2><0xA3>200.”
The protein we use in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth warms, the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We've been testing for the last few months and it feels perfect to share it on Halloween because it gives a wonderful glowing effect
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I’ve made since the jellyfish glow is four times more expensive than gold.
So each scoop costs me around 140 pounds.
Ikea is very good.
The experimental company, based in Bristol, Charlie is famous for its unusual taste, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next creation is going to prove even more ambitious.
He said: “I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.”
It is natural impossible due to ice crystals that form refractory over ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the usefulness of a jellyfish that has been synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The entire market in Rani Bagh market was hit by customers.
It was recently that people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy utensils.
The same was the case with the central markets at Wazirpur, Awantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market and Prashant Vihar.
Similar sightings were also seen at shops in Pitampura, Ashok Vihar and Model Town.
People also bought gold and silver ornaments and coins.
This led to traffic jams in other markets, including the outer ring road.
However, those who left the office for home had to spend hours in the jam to get home.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay late and play dress up neighborhoods.
Today, I've become more of a greedy person.
I didn't even sign in to give Candy out of my apartment for the last two years and probably won't be this year either.
But the statistics show that there is a black sheep in it when Halloween comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating <0x24>158 million this time, spending <0x24>6.9 billion on candies and costumes and decorations.
One of the things that I have always seen is the appearances of every Halloween.
According to the NRF, the total cost of dress is estimated at <0x24>1.2 billion out of <0x24>6.9 billion.
This year, we are all obsessed with sexist objects.
Women don't have to be prostitutes, because they are sexy food, like pizzas, hamburgers, and carrots.
I hope for the men a lot of zombies, and thank you for making our Instagram feeds for the men of the living dead space this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after outfits will be zombies, Batman, Robbers, and Thumps.
I don't think there is anything wrong with being traditional.
Last year we wore a dog costume and surprisingly we were not alone.
According to the NRF, Americans will literally spend <0x24>330 million for pet costumes.
It's hard to believe that there are a lot of dog breeds.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to Nielsen Company, Americans will spend <0x24>1.9 billion this year.
Hairy Bars, Lollipop, Milk Dadds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is good news that 41 million trucks and trucks are participating in our neighborhood.
But in reality, we, and what we're making fun of, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we won't use candycorn during Halloween, but it will also sell for about 35 million pounds.
That's about 9 billion of Mecca's personal dolls.
This is a mystery. To solve yet
There's nothing more dramatic than the Halloween ghost house.
They have the best name, "the terror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "the look-and-feel" and "like the house of shock."
In fact, according to American power, there are 1200 officially sanctioned ghost houses in the United States that generate 500 million revenues. And those awesome good photos that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes to see you and comments on Nice Face.
Finally, let's talk about the pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "Baby in a Pumpkin Trend" started last year only because of Pinterest, so most of us grew up with these guards by carving them and not staying with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year, Americans will spend around <0x24>106 million on pumpkins.
Jack-o-slowly marshal lanterns on his front porch probably from Illinois, which increased from 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you’re looking for additional loans, try to engrave their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin over the phone Tim and Susan Matisses in Napa.
It was decided to issue a postage stamp with a photo of Sachin during the presentation before the start of the match, the MCA said in a statement.

The dream of the firecracker traders to do business in the firecracker market located in the transport area has not been fulfilled.
The firecrackers have been trapped in the meadow following the High Court order.
Neither can they now do business in the temporary firecracker market created at Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses to do business in the transport area.
The Commission, constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, declared the temporary firecracker market on Ranjit Avenue as unsafe during its visit.
The Amritsar deputy commissioner was also fined Rs 10 lakh for not having proper arrangements there.
In its order, the High Court has slammed the administrative authorities of Amritsar, saying that such an administration could not solve even a difficult task of firecrackers for nine years.
They could not find a suitable place in the city.
Following this, the firecrackers were asked to issue licences for business in the shipyard market itself.
Even though the firecrackers were happy after the order, their happiness was diverted by the police on Friday.
A team of the police's realha license branch reached the firecracker market and sold the farm by setting up counters there.
It was impossible to fulfill the conditions that were given to him after that in a day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, In-Charge Anup Kumar and SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached the cracker market.
He expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by the firecrackers traders.
Therefore, licenses were not issued to firecrackers traders.
Diwali is a day away.
Due to this, the traders are worried.
They are facing a loss of crores of rupees.
Firecrackers Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say they will sue the district administration if they lose crores of rupees.
Aggrieved firefighters took out a protest march from the shipyard to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They raised slogans against the police and the district administration.
Subsequently, the temporary firecracker market in Ranjit Avenue was also closed.
A fire brigade was called in to rescue a lost pope at the mouth of a troubled mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after a short road collision
He was seen by a dog walker trapped in the mine three days later.
Firefighters lowered the front part of the rock from the rope to protect the dog from the mouth of death
After the papal somehow trapped 50 feet above the ground at the mouth of a troubled mountain, the firefighters were called to give him a lucky life.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the Flappyt mine in West Yorkshire to meet again with Ruby, and they have blessed the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he fled after a short accident, he discovered his lost dog like crazy, and an appeal was posted on social networking sites.
At 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby on the mountain in the mine at an altitude of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Clekheton fire station rushed to the spot and took Ruby down with a rope to save her and used a stomach tube to bring her down from the rock.
Specialist technical rescue officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a critical condition.
She was in the middle of the front part of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
She did not commit a single act during the rescue, she remained a stone.
But now he's good.
After that, she was eating biscuits.
It was an unusual call for help.
It's incredible to see a dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby has survived fortunately."
He was likely to be seriously injured or in a worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be good in addition to exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrible to see the rescue work."
At first I couldn’t believe how she got there.
It's amazing to get him back in his hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was too tired and fell, she would definitely fall down.
The fire brigade did a great job.
What they have done is truly a courageous act.
We were all good friends, and they were all good.
Mr. Alderson from Keigali also said: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire brigade did a great job.
I don't know how he got there.
Mick Jagger says Katy Perry did not hit her when she was 18
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, the star said she had sung backing vocals for Zager's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry said he had dinner with senior Rocker, and he hit me when I was 18.
“This thing got old, and he treats me well.”
The 70-year-old Jaeger's representative said in a statement on Thursday that he "clearly denies ever striking Katy Perry."
The representative also said: "Possibly parry, talking about them in the misunderstanding of another person."
Perry was one of the singers who came as a guest on Rolling Stone's Tour this year.
His new album "Prime" reached the top spot this week.
George Keraven: The dissolution of the euro gave Scotts a choice
Another day, another story of the fear of freedom.
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel zone throughout Europe as a condition of EU membership.
The passport control on Burwick and the extent of the barbed wire on the walls of Hadrian indicate stories.
The truth is that the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, though - predictably - did not describe it in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as needed.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen region, Brussels will be an affordable discount for sustainable non-compliance Brussels in return for getting what it really wants from Scotland.
So, then, non-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long is frozen. First of all I heard the unfounded news of “freedom means passport control” about 40 years ago.
Still, the interesting point in retelling this interesting old story was lost.
Why should independent Scotland, anyway, expect to bid for Europe?
Why should London’s Yoke be sold to Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Dedicated teams are gaining strength throughout the EU to oppose the EU or close the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany Party - which has been founded this year - suddenly gained nearly five million votes in the September federal election, and thus effectively ousted the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a domestic opposition to the plan to build federal Europe.
But, the current economic crisis proved radically transformative.
Along with the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are having to think that project Europe has gone too far due to the constraints placed on national economies through compliance with the same currency.
The euro crisis did not have much role in the excessive budget deficits of national governments - this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the currency exchange rate in favour of German exporters to its members - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself in a position of inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public spending – which has been encouraged by Berlin.
There is a deeper European productivity morbidity beyond the current budget and currency problems.
To provide concessions to French and German energy firms on consumer spending – as a result of the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times for gas as compared to the United Nations.
This is a punctual cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemuth.
Even freeing up all wages in the world, the European petrochemicals industry cannot be spared from being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, the spirit of rebellion is flaring up among the people, especially in France, who was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, France's top politicians saw the EU as a way to keep Germany under control, and Paris as a means of providing a billing equivalent to Vashtiton in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, causing the French economy to stagnate.
Results: Marian Lee Penn's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has won the third place in the recent by-election, pushing the ruling socialist.
The front is currently the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – it’s a timely warning for British Labour that they can’t walk by assuming that the disintegration for the left, will automatically take advantage of the right.
What is Lee Penn doing with his new found fame in the middle of French blondes, working class?
The party wants to use the next year's EU elections to form an anti-EU, anti-money laundering group in the European Parliament.
If, as much as possible, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, then such a faction could affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is this: soon the union of anti-EU and anti-universal sentiment in Europe will put an end to the euro.
The euro will not end completely, but it will gradually return to a form such as “Europe of sovereign nations” that will be supported by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its backward economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will resume their currencies.
I hope the UK will keep itself away from this project in hopes of increasing its closeness with the U.S.
However, Vanshington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all?
We can choose to remain (essentially) the territory of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better in a loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-federal nations to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think about maintaining our economic freedom while on the road to Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - has been the most successful anti-materialist political campaign in Europe, winning a surprise majority in 2011 on the basis of the (and implemented) cuts proposed by Labour's Chancellor Alastair Darling and then the Tory-Lib Dam alliance.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that case it would have to accept the rules of mitigation imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Childhood: Growing up too fast
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get puberty at a younger age than white girls.
Physical change does not mean that youth is near.
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe obesity outbreaks may be a cause of puberty at a young age
The case of premature puberty is not as effective in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is an expert journalist on children's health and family issues.
Should the mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breast and genital hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Pediatric Academy in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr Paul Caplovitz made it clear that these early physical changes are common among American girls, showing a new trend.
“I spend a lot of time convincing parents – that this generally does not reflect rapid progress towards full puberty,” says Capploitz.
The direct signs of development such as germination of breasts, genital and ear hair and physical smell are visible prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (first menstrual-religion).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, from 12.75 in the year 1970.
“It takes at least two to three years in first menopause when the breasts begin to develop,” explains Capplovitz, who is also the author of “The Time-Pregnancy in Girls: The Guide to Dealing With This Common Problem.”
The most accurate test time for the development of puberty is.
There is a debate about what is the beginning of puberty, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8 years, the two are called "child-adults."
In most cases, the procedure will slow down or stop – which can be closely monitored by a child doctor.
In the event of more rapid progress, an endocrinologist may need to be examined to address the possibility of serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
Treatments for delaying pre-menstrual and other outcomes are: premature aging of the bones, which can lead to debilitating growth and nausea as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal treatment depend on the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovits are aware of drugs but admits, “pressing youth can raise behavioral issues, and girls may begin to feel different from their peers.”
The second big problem can be understood: parents simply don’t want their younger daughter to have a monthly religion.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene,” said Capplovitz.
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruating at the age of 10, recalls, “It was a shock.”
Although there were signs of this and we had talked about the month-to-month religion, she was not emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and returned upset that she had first started menstruating among her peers.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of untimely puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexually-oriented messages in the media can be charged.
Boys - just like girls - are gaining premature puberty.
Caplovits determine the rule that the main cause of this is an outbreak of obesity.
They helped conduct the study over girls aged 6 to 9 in 2001, which combines body fat with puberty time.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are also many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to get puberty before their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the pattern of premature puberty, from economic conditions to weather and genes, seems to be influenced by everything.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at an early age, the trend of puberty is not as clear as girls in them.
Other physicians who attended the AAP conference supported the complexity of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see hair from mouth and genitals.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual beginning of puberty,” says Dr Laurence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryev Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their child's doctor to take an opinion on how to talk to their children.
Keplovitz advised, “This may mean having a conversation before the expected time.”
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond properly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.
The minimum temperature was recorded at 3.1 degrees Celsius.
On Wednesday night, the rain and the cold wind made people feel very cold.
On Sunday, people wore sweaters and headed to their destination.
After the first rains of the winter, people have also taken out the rabi.
In the morning, people enjoyed watching the sunset.
The weather will also get a lot of relief from the cold, etc. disease, but after that there was a cloudy sky throughout the day.
The children also went to school wearing a sweater.
According to the IMD, the maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius while the minimum was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
The rainfall was recorded at 7.8 mm.
According to the Meteorological Department, the sky will remain cloudy.
Large orders of jet manufacturers at stake from the dispute for seat width.
This month's Dubai Arsso has created a rift among the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-distance flights.
The controversy focuses on the width of the seat of the economy class in long-flying aircraft, not always the same as the one given by the airlines but whose allotted space efficiency has been claimed by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company as the key.
The industry standard is expected to be at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in the economy cabin this week, but it should be decided by airlines, says Boeing, its chief rival.
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when a possible order entered after the 17-21 incident caused a stir to sell the large version of the twin engine of the long-range aircraft.
How has the previous section of the aircraft been built- especially considering whether the seating is 9 or 10 is equal to the capacity of the mini jumbo jets?
Boeing says it has created a "777 <0x58>" that will accommodate 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 logos in a row in the unitary department.
Airbus says it will compete with the A350 to take 350 people in an 18-inch 9-equivalent seat.
Aircraft giants often strike trade on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, with Airbus 777 <0x58> expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai Arsso, it is further appealing to the public.
Recently, it is being seen that the beginning of the Vigilant War has been anything but showing this to Finniero, will you accept it together in a restaurant together?
Airbus sales head John Lehi said "Boeing is also offering long-range flights in close proximity to regional turbos".
As a change, people are getting big, but the way the plane sits has not changed.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970s when the Boeing 747 Jumbo defined the modern long-haul journey, and the average 40-49-year-old American male of the late 19th century gained me 10 percent.
According to the American Health Statistics, the average American male waistline in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rivals cling to a seat concept of the 1950s when the average perimeter of the new name "Jet Set" was narrow.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an additional 53 per cent improvement in sleep quality in the width of the seat.
Boeing has disputed Airbus' seat measurement statistics, saying it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers on how airlines balance between rentals and facilities.
It also says, research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of more than a cabin.
Boeing cabin specialist Kent Kraveer said: "It really explains what needs to be done to give airlines flexibility and what they believe they need to do to be successful."
"They don't want to tell us what they're benefiting from."
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers this is about the elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
The trade estimated at least <0x24>700 billion behind this controversy is enough, in the coming decades, to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.
Reuters reported that for the first time in July, the seat layout is actually a battle point between the new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that their new twin-engine design had a 20 per cent workforce, compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300r.
Boeing’s performance claims depend on the 777 <0x58> One with 10 on the comparison with the original 9 with the 777 design.
10 equal to the profit in unit cost is now used in comparison.
Kevin Kensington, head of Europe's Airbus passenger facility, says "Boeing's this aircraft is doing it to make our products more competitive, and to occupy more seats".
Analysts, on the other hand, say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin suggests for the current 777 S that many passengers are in favor of the Denser layout, which can go with cheap fares as well.
"The eighteen-inch seat width will be great for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of the Airbus is driven by the threat of proposal 777," said Mary Curby, founder and editor of the company.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list to choose from from suppliers for airlines.
Jet vendors around the world should also take careful measures to check on this layouts competition.
While resting more comfortably, all builders are also offering low-cost jet aircraft services and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is offering a 10-equivalent A350 but says it is not sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus insisted on extensive cabin seats on some of its jet planes for the need for more cabin facilities.
Modern jets are unlikely to fly to a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it can distract from the 777 <0x58> sales wave.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate the fun that comes from smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine was able to keep mice safe from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
Further testing is needed before testing on humans, which may take several years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at the Will Cornell Medical College in New York, said the initial signs are positive.
"We are very hopeful that the strategy of this type of vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers who have attempted to quit using all the methods available in the market today, but found that their addiction to nicotine is far more powerful than these existing methods," Cornell said.
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, designed to transmit genetic information aimed at creating anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus, selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, preventing them from being exposed to nicotine in the smoker by sterilizing them before they reach the brain.
In the trial, the rats who were given the vaccine, who were later given the nicotine, continued their normal activities.
But the researchers say that the rat who was not vaccinated felt "good", it was a sign that nicotine had reached its brain.
This experiment was described in a journal called Science Translational Medicine.
The earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be administered at regular intervals to maintain levels of antibodies, but it turned out to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, as the liver will make the cell an antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before the temptation to try cigarettes, so that they can be protected from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again they won't enjoy smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help break their habit," he said.
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned of the need for much more research.
Even after the post-mortem, the actual cause of death of the tiger could not be ascertained.
The forest department is giving a golmole reply in this regard, prima facie describing the death of the tiger as natural.
On Thursday night, the forest personnel of the Ramnagar Forest Division found the body of a tiger near the Pavalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi drain.
All the organs of the dead body of the tiger were safe as well as there were no injury or injury marks on it.
The post-mortem of the dead body was conducted by the veterinary doctor of CTR Bharat and hema Rathore, veterinary doctor of Kotabag, in the presence of forest conservator Vivek Pandey, deputy director of CTR Saket Badola, DFO Khaksha Naseem and SDO G S Karki.
According to sources, the internal body of the tiger is said to be damaged during the post-mortem.
The exact cause of death could not be ascertained.
On the death of the tiger, the departmental officer gave a golmaal reply.
However, the internal organs of the tigress have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for a topological examination to confirm the poisoning.
The death of the tiger can be said to be natural, Forest Conservation Western Circle Vivek Pandey said.
No symptoms of poisoning etc. have been found from the dead body of the tiger.
However, the area around it is being searched and sent for a Bisra probe to confirm the poison.
Tripods deny being influenced by us.
Former NSW labour minister Joe Tripodi will be examined by the State Carpenter Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripody has refused to rebut the policy at the request of his political guru, Eddie Obaid, the patron of former New South Wales, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed the investigation into whether Mr. Obaid for violating circulars of the policy of lobbying from several state ministers where two restaurants and cafes, owned by Obid, were renewed without tenders after its expiry in August 2005.
Lin Ashpole, the former deputy chief of staff, was aware of Mr. Tripodi's hidden selfishness of the allegation after the evidence was given on Thursday.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pushed for the introduction of public tenders for leases.
The lessees were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the circular's enterprise for leases, which Obid earned <0x24>25 million annually, was renewed from tenders without leases.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the Public Tender.
But he declined to make changes at the request of Mr.Obide, Mr.Tripodi had requested for a change in government lease policy
The transcripts presented in a phone calls to the ICAC in August and September 2007 Mr.Obide and Mr.Tripody and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Fisheries Department of Mr.Obide after working in the Ministry of Ports
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheley asked Mr. Tripodi. “Was the development of commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the matter?”
"No," Mr. Tripoli answered.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
Officials say Israeli fighter jets blew up in Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed Fox News.
The official did not say what the motive was, but there was at least one motive required.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the Russian missile SA-125.
Israel has carried out airstrikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers on 457 visas can undergo a "certification" test
The government is considering a "authenticity" test for foreign employees on 457 visas, as it aims to extend a rigorous procedure.
If adopted, the test will be carried out through a set of criteria aimed at preventing 457 used to fill in unskilled positions in Australia or to transport family and friends in a disguised manner.
A government discussion paper was released today, condemning the government's rhetoric about foreign employees, former Labour MP Maxine McCullough said today it could anger Australia's neighboring countries.
He told the U.S. India Institute today that “foreigners are reaching the end of the queue” and “Australians before jobs” are a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have demanded a safe labour market.”
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if some people in the area have seen the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about the smugglers, has implemented five recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant can be examined as to "whether the nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominee, the owner of the person sponsoring the visa, or the relative or personal partner of the person in question."
Businesses may need to keep count of the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected cardiac arrest after being in a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s nine-year-old son had come to Australia on a trip with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday, one of his adult cousins has tied the wand, who was on the same vessel.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase the benefits of Scotland from the HS2 rail project.
Work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kremer pointed out that the project "will make Britain one."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" by working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include the new high-speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
Upon completion of the second phase, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building high-speed links between London and Northern England to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Ltd to consider the rail capacity for Northern England and Scotland and the possibility of further improving the travel time.
This includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: “Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer.”
We are moving forward with HS2, as its benefits will be much higher.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about connectivity to 18 cities in the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be well connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael to "clear" Scotland's return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “High-speed rail is likely to have huge economic benefits for Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the entire case of high-speed rail across the UK.
So we are excited to work in partnership with the British Government to explore options to bring high-speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all and to meet the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report next year with British government ministers and taking a decision together on further action.
Aircraft electrical equipment rules will still be in effect in Australia
In the US, equipment-related regulations will have to be relaxed, Australian airline passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left options open to U.S. aviation service companies to change their procedures, so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical stages of flight, provided that the equipment remains in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can do this on many flights right now, but many people do not like to be unable to access their e-book while flying and landing.
Australian airline companies are considering the decision, according to which US airline service companies will have to do a lot more to meet this requirement, but they have indicated they have no immediate plans to make changes to their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment in critical stages of flight in Australia are still effective.
"Currently, the CASA does not have any specific regulation governing the misuse of electrical equipment in the aircraft," the authority said, adding that "the issue falls under the regulation, which requires the airline operating companies to ensure that the safety system is always fully maintained, and passengers have to comply with the safety instructions given by the crew members."
Virgin who is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system is ready to follow this change, but she asked for further action on the regulatory directive.
"We will welcome the review by CASA in case the use of electrical equipment is allowed, as we really feel it will provide customers with a better experience, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our aircraft," the spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would follow the current rules.
“As per our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used while flying and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change it,” it said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will definitely consider the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will vary on each U.S. aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, as well as modify their manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and brief descriptions to passengers.
The FAA said that "after verification of the tolerance of their aircraft by airlines, it will allow passengers to use handheld, light-weight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all altitudes."
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment be safely placed under the seat or in the upper compartment while flying and landing.
Gold of Ponnbrokers due to difficulty being felt by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirathalinga at Ponshop in Bendemier shopping centre in Singapore is taking cash by giving her gold bangles, rings and earrings to pay her daughter's school fees.
“My husband and I recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it.
She says that, although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 US dollars) as administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, parts of Southeast Asia have similar demand – where domestic debt is growing – valuemax where they are making their transactions, becoming the third ponshop to be listed on Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Jewellery mortgages are not the only way to get cash - in the case of Ms. Amirathlinga <0x24>1,300 - but also as cheap as almost unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, Ponbrokers typically charge 17 percent per annum interest, a little higher than the 15.4 percent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pan-brokers have the benefit of not needing a credit check or proof of salary, and they can make loans available faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the region are turning to Ponshop due to the increasing cost of living by families and the difficulties faced by domestic and consumer loans.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial crisis, and after cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to Ponshop to meet their needs due to the slowdown in their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standard's Engages, described the rising domestic profit mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in terms of gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged lightly from the tech slowdown this week.
On Thursday, data showed a steady export slowdown and a decrease in consumer demand.
"The decisive point is that with rising prices, [of income scale] people from middle to lower classes will try to increase their incomes in every possible way," said Song Seng Wun, economist at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB.
Historically high values in gold prices over the past two years have led people to mortgage personal assets as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the value of their family's jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the pledged items in 200 pon outlets of the city-state are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of gold looks good, let's mortgage grandma's gold chain, and take it back next month."
Ejimni, Thailand's largest Ponshop operator, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
There is so much growth in the mortgage business that the outlet's operators in Bendimir, Valumax and 15 others like it in Singapore, plan to expand not only in its neighbourhood, Malaysia where it has four shops, but also plans to expand outside Asia, says Yah Li Ching, executive director of Valumax.
The company will finance it, using 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars found in the listing this week on Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders (lenders) have been criticized due to higher interest rates, Ms. Yah says mortgages not only get cheaper rates than other lenders, but it also does not directly increase the loan.
"Customers pledge items that they already have, and refinancing personal assets doesn't increase domestic debt," she says.
The social acceptance of Ponbroking for short-term and secure financial support is increasing.
It’s not that only financially weaker people use the panbrokers.
In Singapore, rich people also use valuemax outlets, they pledge gold bars or Rolex watches to pay up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.
We have customers from all sections of the society.
“These include wealthy individuals who need a short-term loan for business ventures or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow requirements,” says Ms. Yah.
Sometimes they just need money in a very short time.
India's biggest business tycoon Mukesh Ambani is celebrating his 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organised a large party on the occasion.
Many Bollywood stars arrived in Jodhpur to attend the party. On the late evening of October 31, several big stars were seen holding a flight to Jodhpur at the Mumbai airport.
These stars include Karisma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and her wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose, among others.
Obviously, you can imagine how big the watershed will be when such big names join the party.
<0x24>325 million rescue package for Taji's health
The federal government has insisted that the <0x24>325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ill-health system is also linked to stringent conditions that will ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "immediate action" to address the current crisis due to the ageing population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases, and the limitations of the system.
The decision to finance over the course of four years was taken after consultation with the government with independent Tasmania MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the special challenges being faced by the state.
The <0x24>325 million package also includes an alternative surgery plan of <0x24>31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgeries, will help in resolving past collected cases.
These include walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lawnstation, improved post-hospital care, training of medical experts, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health records system in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the best practices I have been told by leading physicians to improve the health system of Tasmania.”
The Minister stressed that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state has to maintain the current funding level to receive Commonwealth funds, and report every month where additional funds are being spent.
A three-member Commission shall be constituted to ensure that the service is rendered by the State in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr Wilkie said that <0x24>325 million would not mean much, “unless real improvements are made to bring Tasmania’s public health system to a more sustainable level.”
Yet he praised the government for responding to their request for immediate assistance, which they first brought before the Prime Minister in early May.”
“I hope the federal aid package will be very helpful towards separating the state re-public health system from the crisis-hit list,” said Mr Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will largely undo the recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Datton believes today's announcement is "a band-aid solution."
"We are here for the reason that the Labour State government has taken <0x24>430 million in its health system," he told ABCTV.
You can’t consider the state government taking about half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth giving 300 million dollars as a good news day.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Denis Diderot's adaptation of the novel by Gillum Nicklaux details the best production design and time period, but it's far more than it should have been.
The French novel, dated 1760, tells the sad story of Suzan, a young nobleman sent by his family members to the convent.
When she revolts, she encounters extreme cruelty at the hands of the self - sacrificing mother Superior, and becomes an object of sensual attraction to the other.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensation – and that’s the problem.
Due to the seriousness of the narrative, there is also the risk of becoming a boring film for the audience.
CSA Vice-Chancellor Dr Munna Singh has decided to impose entry fee in the garden due to dirt in the garden.
A 15-day ultimatum has been given to correct the condition of the departments.

During this time, he found more than a dozen employees, including directors in these departments, to be out of their seats.
After being reprimanded, he warned of cutting the salary if he was found missing the next time.
Dr Naushad Khan, media in-charge of the university, said a pass of Rs 30 would have to be made for a month-long tour.
People will be able to visit the park on a daily basis at a fee of Rs 1 per day.
The system will work: The files coming in front of the Vice-Chancellor relating to various functions will be accessed under one system.
Every employee shall not have the right to file his or her own file and enter the Vice-Chancellor's office.
The officers concerned will reach their final Vice-Chancellor.
The monitoring group said Syria had destroyed its chemical weapons capability.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria had destroyed critical equipment to make chemical weapons and toxic gas war materials, while a fierce conflict erupted in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic agents are believed to be kept.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian movement group said about 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, which began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before the last date of November 1
The Hague-based organization had designated the damscos as "ineffective" for the chemical weapons production units and for the destruction of the machinery used in the filling of toxic gases and war materials.
Primarily the completion of the initial phase of destruction is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious development that aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Dumsk by mid-2014.
Destroying the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Dumascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
Syria is believed to have 1,000 metric tonnes of chemical and weapons, including Mustard Gas and Nervous Agent Sarin.
Britain's Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that the announcement came after clashes erupted in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage facility.
The movement group, which details the death toll through a network of protests in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government says 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's military, 18,678 are fighting in favour of the government and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said the dead included 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
About 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country due to this conflict.
Assad's army fought rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of which belonged to al-Qaida groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said people from both sides had been injured, but said nothing clearly.
This war represents the threat faced by inspectors of chemical weapons who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria, within a very short time-frame, during the ongoing civil war.
In a statement to the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, it said its team was "now satisfied and confirmed" and had seen all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment destroyed."
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors had said they had completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres announced by the Dumascus.
The inspectors said they were not able to visit the two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers had been "discarded and... the chemical weapons products placed there were transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Safira, was one of the two centres where inspectors of OPCW were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
In a statement issued by the OPCW, the Director General of the Monitoring Group, Ahmet Uzumku, said, “I salute the firmness and courage displayed by you in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization.”
The three-year-old civil war is mainly a conflict between the Assad government and its security forces, including members of the Shiite sect, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a massive explosion at the air defence centre in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known, he said.
The police have recovered a forged registry, forged seals, laptops and photocopies of the forged registry from the possession of the accused.
The Moti Nagar police have registered a case against all the accused.
Police commissioner Paramjeet Singh Gill said that the accused have been identified as Rajiv Agarwal alias Binttu of Chandra Nagar, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohada and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the registrar's office (East) has absconded from the spot.
According to the police, the accused along with Balbir Singh, clerk and record-keeper of the office, used to extract papers from the records of vacant and old land and then buy new stamp papers and prepare a forged registry on them.
Not only that, the real registry was missing and the fake registry was put on record.
Thereafter, the accused used to sell the land on forged papers for crores of rupees.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these fake papers.
After this, the real owner of the land remained in shock accounts of the police and the administration.
The accused, who had prepared a forged registry, were keeping a close watch on the NRI's lands.
Because there is no one to look after the land of NRIs.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell the forged registry of those lands.
During interrogation, the accused said that they have prepared around 150 fake registrations so far, police commissioner Gill said.
According to the police, a case of cheating and theft has been registered against the gang boss Rajiv.
Protests against the execution of a bomber in Bali
The families and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bombings expressed anger over the punishment awarded to the bomber, saying Omar Patek should face the firing team.
Patek, who ran as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted individuals for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years yesterday for his role in building explosive devices used in the bombing.
If given parole, he can be released in 15 years.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in Kuta's famous tourist area, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many others.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings at a church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded a life sentence, though they could also demand that the man, who is notoriously "destroying" as a bomb-making master, be sentenced to death.
The decision rekindled the traumatic memories of the woman in Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
Withholding his apprehensions, he said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really feel like he should have been punished just like other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Cortin told A.A.P., “It should be placed before the firing team.”
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., the name of the club was lost after a bomb was detonated in a van parked outside the club.
Peter Hughes, a bag packed with explosives by suicide bombers, was in the paddies bar exactly 20 seconds before it was detonated.
They moved to a month-long coma as a result of the bombing and died three times while on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes says that Patek should have received the same punishment that three other members of the Jemmah Islamiyah terrorist group - Amaroji, Mukhalas and Imam Samudra - responsible for the massacre - were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be executed before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding countless people, 20 years is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of Bali bomb blasts.
He survived being captured for almost a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military shot down former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Ladin in an attempt to re-establish contact between the South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
Ms. Cortin says, “She didn’t surrender.”
Even today, he doesn’t really feel the pain of hurting so many people.
The decision came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
Ms. Cortin said, “There will be a lot of tears this year.”
Patek can still appeal against his conviction.
FAA: Aircraft passengers can now use gadgets in airplanes (but cannot call from cell phones)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic device to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but will not be able to talk to their cellphones - as part of the highly-anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But travelers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said how fast these changes are implemented will vary in each airline.
The airlines will have to show the FAA how their planes meet the new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for collecting training manuals and devices of their crew members to show the guidelines.
The FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already presented plans.
The FAA said in a statement, "Based on the status of the plan, we can approve the extended use of the electronic device very quickly."
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the plane's door is closed.
They are expected to not turn them on until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and is allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane is down, and not turn them on until the aircraft is fully operational.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic disruption can allow their passengers to use the device while flying, landing and taxiing by aircraft, the FAA said.
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed these changes.
"When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work closely with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win for both sides," Glading said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we are fed up with feeling like "hole monitors."
But surfing, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited by connecting the Internet at an altitude of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, online scrabble-like games, the famous incident associated with which actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while he was at the plane park at the door in 2011, and American airlines had taken him off the plane when he was refused to shut down the device.
And heavy equipment such as laptops, etc., will still have to be stored as they will cause another person to be injured in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be banned during the flight.
The regulatory authority related to phone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift restrictions on certain electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenkan of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is the CBS News' national transport security expert, said the cell phone was still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are a really serious issue, not just because they can potentially cause disruptions to navigation-related devices, but also because they can cause disruption to cell phone towers when they are in the air," Rosenker said.
To examine the issue, the industry advisory committee set up by the FAA last month recommended that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
Their use has increased pressure on the FAA in recent years to reduce restrictions.
Critics such as Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, have said there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming even more difficult to enforce because the use of the device is ubiquitous.
Some studies also indicate that about a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996 when reports of disruption in navigation and communication devices were received by passengers due to carrying FM radio and high-tech gadgets at the time.
New airlines are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes from passengers for many years.
The modified aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to disruption.
Huarta said most airlines must meet eligibility criteria for further use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit much less radio transmissions of power than the previous generation's electronic devices.
E-readers, for example, have a nominal transmission during page flipping.
But transmissions are strong when downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com has also been one of those who favoured reducing restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the company's officials loaded the entire Kindle e-readers in the airline and flew it to test the problems but found no such problems.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks posed by the use of the device.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aviation Passenger Association said he believes the disruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the disruption by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the committee members recommended that the FAA allow the pilot to order the passengers to shut down the device at the time of landing in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them a common knowledge facility for people travelling in the latest era of technology.
Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said: "We are delighted that the FAA has recognized that the traveller with pleasure is not incompatible with rescue and security.
Taking lessons from the serial bomb blasts in Patna, the UT Police has tightened its waist for quick reaction during Diwali celebrations and emergency situations in view of the security situation.
A total of 1800 soldiers, including vehicles and pedestrians, will be patrolling at all the main points of the city, crowded markets and other places to ensure smooth movement of traffic, prevention of flash floods, teaching lessons to the traffic, etc.
These personnel will include women police personnel, including PCR, traffic unit and police personnel.
Police personnel and commandos will be on duty at hotels, guest houses and PGs in the city to check the records carefully.
The SHO has been directed to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the matter.
The DSP has also been entrusted with the responsibility of checking the markets, malls and other places in the city, including the VIP sectors.
In view of the emergency situation and Diwali festival, the higher authorities have also fixed the duty of additional police personnel in police control in view of the convenience of the people.
The police have asked the staff of the fire department, PGI director, principal director and DHS, Sector 16 GMSH and Sector 32 GMCH management, besides other dispensaries to maintain high alert during the emergency.
To teach a lesson to the manchalas, the departmental authorities have now put women police personnel, among others, on duty by naming them as 'Anti Gunda Staff' under the leadership of NGOs.
The police personnel of the anti-gunda staff team will be busy at crowded places, including markets in plain clothes.
On Diwali, all SHOs have been ordered to install 44 nakas in the inner areas of the city.
Police personnel will also be deployed at 38 Naka points at the city borders.
The bird was released back into the wild by air transport for protection from the North Sea Rig
The bird found in the North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild from the coast by air transport.
The bird, named Water Rail, was sent back to Aberdeen by the Scottish SPCA at their Alloa rescue centre before being rehabilitated.
"This water rail was probably the winter migratory bird of Northern Europe, which was hit by strong winds over the North Sea," center manager Colin Sedan said.
The bird seemed to be tired and took refuge on the oil rig.
He further explained: “It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help.”
Before leaving, the water rail was healthy and well.
Is Europe’s high class ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April and a pledge was made to bring the business together and determine what changes the UK's employment and prosperity creators want to see in our relationship with the EU.
For that, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought about Britain’s business with the EU.
U-Gov took up the idea of 1000 business leaders representing Britain’s business size, regions and locations.
The results of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large proportion of businessmen now want to export outside Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member states are becoming segregated.
They want the government to prioritise new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not engage in the long-term and vicious process of reforming the EU's mysterious institutions.
When asked about his views on specific policy areas, from monopolistic regulation to product legislation, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster.
Common dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of Brussels’ regulation is far greater than the benefits of becoming part of Europe’s trading sector – even 40 percent of the vast businessmen who traditionally favoured European companies agreed.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part of the UK clearly wants to move on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change, rather than politics with the EU.
The findings, which were seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are driven by a "meaningful change" that would give the UK its lost power back.
It has a very high price - the issue of a treaty change for Britain and a better deal, in the referendum, changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: this survey shows that UK businessmen support his plan to negotiate on the terms of Britain's membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect to renegotiate, making a meaningful change to the current power balance in favor of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming increasingly imperative, as the eurozone is moving forward towards the bounded economy and the fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that for businessmen it means a new focus on business and a fundamental change in Brussels’ regulatory procedures.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls the pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new era
The head of Gazprom said the beginning of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects.
“Today has been a historic event: Construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
The South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said that a dispute involving the contract between Gazprom's Counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where much of Russia's gas is for Europe, presents a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant an end to "forever" the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries.
After the completion of the entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from the South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees accused of sexual offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears
Two employees of YMCA NSW have been charged with child sexual offences before charges were levelled against Caringbah child care employee Jonathan Lord in 2011.
But in its statement before the commission, it said it had "never seen a case of child sexual abuse within its organisation", the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which the YMCA Caringbah Gym Instructor was charged with child sexual offences against the children in his care in the year 1991.
Advocate Gayle, who assisted the Commission, told Mr. Hare that he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the statement of YMCA before the Commission that "YMCA has been examined externally and has found YMCA to be at the forefront of child protection" is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that YMCA was notified, and it secured the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is 21 years of age with YMCA, admitted that the reason for appointing the Lord "including myself" management has failed, and failed to ensure that employees are clearly aware of their obligations related to reporting child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during a two-year tenure at YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr Hare denied the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the YMCA, due to which the employees did not report child safety violations by the Lord.
What the employees saw about the breach was evidence that the Lord allowed them to spend time alone with children, get them personally babysitting, put them in the lap, tell them that he loves them and let them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the supervision of the Lord, and had asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the YMCA caringbah child service manager, who supervised the Lord, was "very bully and difficult to get most of the time."
The CEO said it did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in giving information above their manager.
She said that, rather, her friendship with Lord misled her decision to give information about her.
Mr. Hare said that he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW Mandal that, from the "Jonathan Lord incident" the text for the organization was "about not giving information."
Mr Hare said the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by employees soon after the allegations came to light was made by YMCA's Child Services Managing Director Liam Whiteley.
He said it was intended to avoid a blend of evidence, but it was not executed "extremely" and correctly.
Stephen Smalbone, special professor of child sexual abuse at Griffith University, said the YMCA NSW was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord's tenure between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" in the appointment, supervision, entry, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been adjourned to December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like an opportunity to become Britain's Prime Minister again - but he believes there is no possibility of a comeback.
In an overnight interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as a leader, limiting most of his comments to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and peacemakers of the Middle East group, Mr Blair largely avoided discussing British politics.
Asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, of course, but that's unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When Cardiff had a crowd of experts displaying horses for the best horse of the year, he knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Feenton Kirkland.
Not even in school yet and a few months away from taking his first step, this little boy and his grandson Shetland’s tatu tafi easily completed three stages and won the top prize – she surpassed her 30 adult rivals.
At the annual competition organized by the Sunnyback Equestrian Center in Rudry, near Cardiff, the unbreakable pair - which is the length of the SK - was highly praised for its appearance, behavior and style.
In front of the men and women wearing the beautiful baller hat, she trimmed her flat hat at an alley angle and turned her two-year-old Toffee around the ring.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural ability to control which is far beyond his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was gifted to Toffee last March as a gift on his third birthday, and has practiced with this tattoo of Shetland daily since then.
Her 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a fantastic couple."
They had to face the challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won the Gold Cup and the Roset.
It was only the second time he had competed in a competition with Toffee, and we are all very happy with his win.
The most different in this color field, he felt so amazing to everyone that he wanted to take photos with him.
The little boy, from Nantinglo village near Ab Well, South Wales, is walking on the footprints of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Shrimat Howells said: “The whole place was full of excitement, and everyone was cheering and clapping.”
He was running on the sand all over the place, and despite being so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is the deviant of animals - he loves horses, tractors, and farm, and he has two hens he takes care of.
The kind of start he has made will be at the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I am sure he will perform very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he comes to control his pony.”
They are a very good couple.
The decision-makers gave the points given the way Fenton and Toffee performed and the way they performed in the show ring.
He saw a good team work between Tatoo and his rider - in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm pretty sure Fenton's cute clothes have helped him, he looked really different.
The Chinese newspaper will be the "renovation" of the plea
A Chinese newspaper that made an appeal on the homepage for the release of a reporter convicted of defamation will be restored, a press regulator said.
The newspaper New Express in Guangzhou had made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write fabricated news about the state's part-owned company.
The regulator said that now the New Express has to go through a "complete improvement."
The order for "correction" came from the Guangdong Press and Publications, the radio, film and television administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had printed a lot of false news about the listed company Jumlaion in the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "The editorial management of the New Express was inconsistent."
It said it had decided to impose an administrative penalty "by cancelling Chen Yongzhou's reporter's license."
It had "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of the New Express, recommending the New Express to examine those responsible for it and immediately revise the New Express's leadership team."
Mr. Chen wrote many articles in New Express blaming financial irregularities in a construction-equipment company called Jumlaion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published two home-page appeals for his release, saying it supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came on state television and accepted to write and publish false stories for money.
“In this case, I have damaged Jumlaion as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win people’s trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did this mainly because I was obsessed with money and fame.
I am aware of my mistakes.
After Mr Chen's apology, New Express issued a homepage apology, stating that it had failed to properly scrutinize his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have admitted to TV broadcasting defects.
Experts say that the convictions are made from time to time, despite the fact that a law in the latter part of this year prohibited the authorities from forcing a person to blame themselves.
Shri Hanuman Chalisa, National President of the Anti-Terrorism Front, Maninderjit Singh Bitta, will deliver the text of Shri Hanuman Chalisa, which will be held at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar Bypass on November 23.
This information was given by Bitta to the gathering after the Chief Spokespersons of Sri Hindu Justice Bench Praveen Dang and Ashwani Katyal, Bhupinder Banga, Surjit Jain, Bunty Bajaj, Raman Khosla, Bantu and Anil Sharma invited them for the text of Hanuman Chalisa.
He lauded the efforts of the Shri Hindu Justice Bench to connect children with Sanatan culture.
For the unity and integrity of the country, it is also necessary to impart religious education to children, including worldly education.
U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel found its own railway
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S.A. and Mexico has its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. authorities have described the four-foot-tall three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is approximately the length of six football pitches, which connects the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide a drug-filled truck.
Officials said it had been closed before a drug was passed from the tunnel.
According to court records, authorities have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
The three men, who were said to be working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison and life imprisonment.
Traffickers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
In October, some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered since the central Mexico's marijuana crop, which poses a challenge to drug mafia groups to figure out how to get the product to consumers faster.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-gauge route equipped with a rail track that spanned from a home in Tijuana to San Diego warehouses.

The British police have issued a notice to Assange.
British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at Ecuador's embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said he had sent an "attempt notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to appear at the police station, as well as saying that he would be responsible for his arrest if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden due to sexual offences charges, and his options under British law expired when the Supreme Court turned down his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm will hand him over to the U.S., fearing he had requested asylum at Ecuador's embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
A spokesman said Scotland Yard had sent "a surrender notice to the 40-year-old Assange, for which he was required to appear at the police station on the date and time we chose."
He is in violation of his bail terms.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on an anti-spyware website called WikiLeaks, he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges.
Driver fined <0xC2><0xA3>1000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving at a speed of 130 mph with hot drinks between feet
On the driver, keeping a hot drink between the legs and driving at a speed of 130 mph (210 km/h) has been fined 1,000 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000).
The 35-year-old Andrew Hovey of Tiptree, Essex, was seen driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Brentry on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a take-away drink of their feet.
In the Colchester Magistrates' Court, Hovey has admitted the charge of negligent driving.
Seven points were added to his license, resulting in a ban on him from driving a car for six months.
Hovey was also ordered to pay a charge of 90 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>90) and a victim surcharge of 100 pounds (<0xC2><0xA3>100).
Tax on foreign property owners will end London's artificial status
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated CGT measures, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had introduced stamp duty duty at a rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than 2 million pounds, and persons who prefer to own a house in a company rather than a separate person.
The stamp duty received from residential properties in the towns of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea in the tax year 2012/13 was <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, which is already more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr Cook said: “After the increase in stamp duty of high value houses and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a fair tax on high value property which has nothing to do with the impact of the old council tax system.
"But this move has remained silent in buying property in London and may make some foreign investors reluctant to sell it to current owners," he added.
Prime property, the top 5 to 10 per cent share of the housing market in Rich South-West London, which stretches from Phulham to Wimbledon, has risen a record 11.8 per cent last year.
According to Sevilla's research, Central London's values continued to grow by 5.6 percent each year, but seemed to be slightly lower than the growing "domestic" market, as the city's southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent).
Scientists have further highlighted what is the relationship between the dog's tail movements and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while restless dogs move their tail more primarily to the left.
But now scientists say fellow dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of tail and respond to it.
The study has been published in the journal Current Biology.
"All of us know well that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in different ways in a stimulus that generates positive or negative emotions," said Georgia Vellartigra, a neuroscientist professor at the University of Trento.
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He pointed out that in dogs, like humans, the right part of the brain was responsible for left-handed movements and the opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to one-way dung shaking by other dogs, researchers tracked animals watching other dogs' movies.
They measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not take long for us to understand why their dung sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Prof. Vellartigara pointed out: “We introduced dogs with dog films – in a realistic version or in a photo-picture to deal with other issues that confuse, and we could see the tail movements and present the tail more left or right.”
When the animals saw a feelingless dog moving his tail to the right, they were completely relaxed.
But when they saw the tail turning to the left (from the sight of the dog again), their heart beated and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigara, he does not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these actions.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience what actions they should be concerned about and not at what.
He said: “If you’ve met other dogs several times, and it’s related to more friendly behavior if they constantly move their tail to one side, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience.”
Researchers say these findings can provide owners, veterinarians, and instructors with better information about animal emotions.
Fellow guest at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, John Bradshaw, a dog behavior expert, said this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their head to the left and turn their head to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another research from the University of Victoria in Canada, he pointed out: “Unlike Italian studies – when the robot dog’s tail was tilted to the left rather than to the right, dogs were more likely to approach it rather than be restless.”
He said that the difference was because in different studies, dogs were not fully understanding animals or robot dogs in movies.
He made it clear that the study of how dogs react to real dogs can help.
"While there has been considerable evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still to be found - and dogs in this case are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we probably won’t take long to understand why their dung sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
The Arctic Monkeys postponed Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner's illness
The Rock Bank, named Arctic Monkeys, has postponed the gig in Glasgow after its lead singer suffered from rheumatoid arthritis.
The Sheffield Group's event was scheduled for Friday to perform at a hydro site in the city.
But the illness of his lead singer Alex Turner forced him to re-set the show's date.
The band's announcement came when they were obliged to postpone the gig at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday in a similar manner.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "After the decision to postpone the show tonight at Birmingham LG Arena, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro on November 1, Friday.
"In the investigation, Alex Turner was found to have a rheumatoid arthritis, and they are not sadly able to perform."
The show will now take place at LG Arena in Birmingham on November 20, and the show at Glasgow Hydro on November 21.
All tickets will be valid for these shows.
We apologize for any inconvenience to all ticket holders.

Pope Francis to announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church, their position is only below the Pope, and these are the ones who elect the Pope, so Francis will be the first group of his individuals to be appointed, who will eventually help in choosing his successor.
At present, there are a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, Cardinals are not allowed to participate in the pope's election after reaching the age of 80 - they fall into the group of 120 "cardinal electors."
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that all existing cardinals will be held before the ceremony to promote the new cardinals, which is called the Pope-Secretary.
“Pope Francis has already decided to announce his decision to hold the February Pope-Council, to make it easier to plan other meetings of cardinals’ participation from different countries around the world,” Lombardy said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline by February.
The pope, in general, announces the number of cardinal electors as low as 120, as many cardinals, and cardinals over the age of 80 as they wish, he said.
Valero said the next year's pope meeting will be important, as it will be the first pope's meeting since Francis was elected in March this year.
At present, there is a kind of prejudice towards Europe, especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope, too, nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Roman Catholics in South America are Catholics, but their number is very low in the Cardinals.
The Cardinals Council by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, whose work is to find ways to reform the church, will also be the first cardinals to be elected after being formed.
Before that, the Pope decided everything on his own.
“Currently Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was "possible" that Francis sought advice from the Cardinals.
But we’re not in this situation before – it’s totally new.
Valerio said that generally the pope gave the bishop of large places the post of cardinal, but Francis was "totally surprised - so we don't know whose name they will declare."
GM calls back pickup trucks in the U.S. to correct seatbacks
According to a report by the U.S. Auto Safety Regulators on Friday, the General Motors Company, its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks have recalled nearly 19,000 trucks to correct a reduction in hand-held seatbacks.
Some trucks may have a reduction in the front seat winding system.
As a result, the Union failed to comply with auto safety standards regarding seatback, head restructuring.
According to an information posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "If the vehicle is stuck from behind, it is possible that the headrest may not properly protect the driver, thereby increasing the risk of injury."
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM's trucks began to be dispatched in June and, after the 2009 Diwali renewal renewal, it marks the most important Wahhan launch for the top U.S. automaker.
GM had informed the truck owners about the defect in late October.
The NSTMA could not review the Swamy notification letter due to a 16-day government shutdown, which disrupted the increase in auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that sales of silverado and sera trucks that were redesigned for the 2014 model year had increased by 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM had sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 series pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, the New York Stock Exchange (New York Stock Exchange) was up 1.4 per cent.
The Disappointment of Obama's Voters
I voted twice for Obama.
He says Obama's great efforts have been hampered by the GOP's blocking policy
Obstacle policy Obamacare website may not shed light on drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir reminds us of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books today.
This is a book about which I feel that this second year will give me a boost during the medical school intoxication and give me a ray of hope.
It's called "The Courage to Win," and it's a reminder of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I get tired of the curtains of my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time in which politics inspired millions and speeches could hold your breath.
The elections proved unilateral, and news speakers took a break to reflect the historical significance of the time.
There were tears of joy in the eyes of my classmates, and my parents saved every newspaper they got.
A group of young visionary people was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
He had an 82 per cent approval rating when he became President in 2008.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a harsh reality, like returning from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
It really changed after I voted for the first time.
Simply put, I couldn’t imagine any of it.
I owe a lot of achievements to Obama, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, to the end of "Don't Ask," until Osama bin Laden is killed.
In addition, I believe that the policy of partisan opposition has prevented many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigration reform, public options for healthcare, closure of bases on Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But the countless times in which I myself take sides with the Obama administration in front of colleagues and colleagues, I have an answer that I can give to them.
I have reached the point of political disillusionment.
The Republican opposition policy is not the answer to the spying of foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency collecting data about the private lives of ordinary U.S. citizens nor can it respond to prosecution of people who expose the government's wrong actions.
It cannot explain the cause of the murder of American citizen Anwar L. Avalaki without trial, nor of public funds and expenditure limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of the report, which says efforts by the White House to silence the media have been "the most aggressive since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, this, even three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website.
I don't know if I was expecting that.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of governance could break the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is apparent that the elected office is not a predictable path, as opposition political parties and random events such as the Newtown massacre will shape our public discussion.
Yet most of the examples I have given above seem to have been chosen by the administration itself.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain choice that did not seem to determine his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have been hearing about for a long time.
Yet, while Obama’s approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to the year 2008 through that book.
It reminds me of his missing words.
This week was reading a portion of the book, describing how Clinton had suffered huge losses because of Obama at the Pennsylvania primary.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they needed to get back on track, and remain loyal to their objectives.
"I want to get my mojo back," he said.
We must remember who we are.”
Five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are from Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that P.M. Tony Abbott's interest in parental leave plan is conflict
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the parental leave plan is a struggle as his daughters can become pregnant, and benefit from it.
Maharathi of the mining sector, who is in dispute over payment of <0x24>6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be crucial in determining carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only the interest of ministers can be a conflict, and said Mr. Abbott's daughters can benefit personally from the policies.
"He may have a significant interest conflict in terms of paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest whether they get a leave or not," said Mr Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax after falling again.
Mr. Palmer called for the restoration of the election count to speed up the process.
Tony Aut's daughters Franz and Bridget.
Should the election result come two months after we cast our vote?
"We should have a better system."
Why can’t we have a system in which we can fill out our variances on the computer, vote immediately and have a result at 6:30 pm?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.
That's because if someone doesn't like it, can they delete it?
In today's time, it seems silly to use pencils.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint discussion letter with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included the creation of an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and that he would "extremely" take up his new task.
Public office is for public service.
“We don’t need any awards other than the prizes in history that we can serve the community at this critical time.”
This caused inconvenience to the plaintiffs.
Addressing the gathering, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his anguish over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
The growing attacks on lawyers and their families prove that the perpetrators have gone unconscious, he said.
They have no fear of the police and the administration.
Referring to such incidents in different places recently, he said the safety of the common man can be easily gauged when the advocate society is not safe.
RBS suspends two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its Foreign Exchange Department, the case received from two people knowledgeable, another indication that the global investigation conducted by regulators in suspected manipulation of the currency market is moving at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the world's largest financial market, with an exchange of <0x24>5.3 trillion each day.
These two traders will be the first employees of the RBS, which has been suspended with the probe going on in the case of the recurrence of the Libor interbank loan fraud.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank had received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, “We are continuing our investigation into the matter, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators.”
Last month, experts from the case said that RBS had sent emails and instant messages to the former trader and sent them to the UK Regulatory, Financial Conduct Authority.
Richard Eusher left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been discharged from his current position as the European head of forex spot trading at J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European spot trading in the city, went on leave last week, while the former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts from the case informed that the instant messaging group of Mr. Youshar includes Barclays and Citigroup bankers.
UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after it was told by the Swiss regulator, Finma that it was probing suspected foreign exchange market manipulations in many Swiss banks.
At least six global authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Competition Authority of Switzerland, the Department of Justice in Weeko, FCA, the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations of mismanagement of bankers for their favourable fluctuations in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or have received requests for information from regulators, they said.
Banks have been closely scrutinizing instant messages and emails equivalent to several years in search of clues to a wrong activity.
The news about the investigation has created a stir among traders in the region who have been among the major gainers in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing the challenge this year, as opportunities for bookmakers have declined due to low volatility in the currency.
Some bankers tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to manipulate a very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say it is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the growing use of its own platform by banks despite the enormous volume of forex buying and selling means “you can start influencing the market at a slightly lower ticket price.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced the removal of the trader from its Exchange Traded Funds desk in London this week, which had lost about <0x24>6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
"We believe the trader acted alone, and has been controlled," Credit Suisse said.
Students studying other courses, including technical and management, will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The University Vice Chancellor has written to the Governor seeking permission to hold elections.
With the commencement of the admission process at the university, the demand for holding of elections was raised.
He had also run a signature campaign on the selection of his representative to reach out to the university administration and college management.
Students taking admission in about two dozen courses, including BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science, will be able to choose their representatives this year.
More than 6,000 students studying here will get the opportunity to exercise their franchise for the first time.
Vice-Chancellor Prof Ashok Kumar said that permission has been sought from the Governor to hold elections in the university.
The date of the election will be announced as soon as permission is given.
"""It is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges."
Many college managements do not want a student union election on their campus.
However, due to lack of unity among the students, elections are also not being held.
The council had launched a signature campaign for the elections.
Akash Jaiswal, Department Coordinator ABVP
After Diwali, permission will be sought from the district administration to hold elections in colleges.
There are also problems with the lack of clarity of the views of the colleges regarding the student union elections.
On Dhanteras, people have bought a lot of gold and silver from pots in the capital.
Such purchases have increased by 20-30 per cent over the previous year
A large number of people thronged jewellery shops in Shimla.
A large crowd was also seen in pot shops decorated from Lower Bazaar to Malroad.
Although this year, the prices of such items have been on the rise, but people have not been able to make purchases on the auspicious occasion.
On Friday, the auspicious day for purchase was from 7:52 am to 10:12 pm and 1:56 pm to 3:37 pm and 6:17 pm to 8:12 pm.
At the time of the said three Muhurats, more crowds of people flocked to the suburbs including Shimla for more shopping.
In the Shimla Lower Market, people did not find a place to hold their feet.
The same thing happened in every small shop.
In such a situation, when the Triodashi of Krishna Paksha of Kartik month is celebrated as Dhanteras, the shopping on Dhanteras is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the healthcare law constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
By a vote of 5-4, the judges ruled in favour of the separate order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act, under which the citizens would be required to buy or pay health insurance before 2014, that it was constitutional under the power of the government to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thomas, Elito and Kennedy disagreed.
The court also supported the remaining paragraphs of the 2,700-page law, and said the condition of the health care law that states increase Medicaid eligibility or that all of them will receive federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The petition was brought by 26 states, and the National Independent Business Federation, to stop the legislation.
During the early session of 2012, the law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including project nominee Mitt Romney.
It is true that our work cannot be done without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for life, but it is not in our interest to accept it all.
We celebrate the Krishna Triodashi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshipped as Kuber, the god of wealth and Yamraj, the god of death.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good.
Our sense of well-being is money.
There is nothing more valuable than the money that comes to the welfare of humanity, but the money that causes arrogance has no meaning.
Let us make money for the holy purpose and spend it only for the holy purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Part of it must also be a sense of spending on society, but the tendency to earn unaccounted collections or yen-change money destroys our conscience, personality.
The spirit of charity should always remain in mind.
A portion of the money you give can also become the basis of one's life.
We should all think about the many people in our society who are living in extreme poverty.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the mantras of life.
Everyone wishes for wealth and success, and according to their merit, they also get wealth and success.
It is the wealth with which the honour is attached.
No matter how rich a criminal becomes, he cannot consume it properly, nor can he benefit anyone else.
If someone else has money, don't worry about it.
The true wealth is the one who makes the way to flow in the innumerable hands of wealth.
There can be no better use of money than creating employment for others.
Another thing, money is not just money.
It would have been your health, character, as well as your love for others.
Try to be the owner of this money.

Special Judge IS Mehta, after hearing the case in a closed room, has granted the NIA's plea and sent Ahmed to 14-day remand.
According to sources, while presenting Ujjar Ahmed before the court, the NIA said Ujjar Ahmed was mainly involved in the incident along with Imtiyaz Ansari and Haider, members of the Indian Mujahideen, the main accused in the Patna serial blasts.
Ahmed had met several other terrorists with Ansari.
The NIA has also sought the arrest of the other accused in the case.
The search for the bomb-making material and the terrorists who made it is yet to be conducted.
For this, he has to take Ahmed to Bihar, Jharkhand and many states, for which he needs to be remanded.

A day earlier, the Special Task Force (STF) had revealed that the PMT of 2012 was forged.
The STF has found fault with the roll number of 700 students in the examination.
Of these, 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admissions of these students can be cancelled.
After the disclosure of the STF, the medical education department has started brainstorming to cancel the admissions of these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting for the list of all these suspected students to meet the STF.
The list will be sent to Vyapam to revoke the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also seeking legal advice in this regard.
The departmental authorities say that it has been one year since the students who took admission in the year 2012, so it is necessary to seek legal advice in this case.
The medical education department officials are not in a position to say anything as the case is now confined to the investigation of the STF.

Poonch Assembly constituency MLA Ejaz Jan inaugurated a water cooler at the Gurudwara campus.
The MLA said that a large number of people visit the gurdwara, but due to lack of proper drinking water, water coolers have been installed here.

After the general elections, if the new government continues its policy of discontinuing the sale of kerosene through ration, then in half a dozen states, kerosene will not be available at these shops.
The states where the sale of kerosene is to be stopped are Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some northeastern states are also set to close the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the petroleum ministry, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two grounds.
The first pillar is the rapid construction of electricity connections in the rural areas.
The second base is the LPG connection.
That is, in states where most of the rural households have been given LPG connections, sales of PDS kerosene are being stopped.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made preparations in this regard.
The sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already stopped since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, the kerosene quota has been reduced significantly in Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
The quota of Punjab has been reduced from 2.72 lakh kg litres to one lakh kg litres.
In Uttarakhand, the kerosene quota has been reduced by about 40 per cent while in Haryana it has been reduced by 70 per cent.
Despite this reduction, there have been no reports of shortages of kerosene from these states.
The ministry is assuming that it is clear that kerosene is being used for adulteration.
Currently, the price of PDS kerosene and diesel is Rs 37.
This will encourage those who are involved.
In states where sales through PDS will be stopped, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
Currently, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene
The burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31,000 crore in 2013-14
The accused used to forgery in the name of buying and selling shares by opening the accounts of investors by referring to the trading firm.
This is perhaps the first time that such disclosures have revealed fraud worth crores of rupees in the state.
The police have not yet reached the spot, but seven persons, including the accused, have been taken into custody in the state.
The gang used to operate a fake commodity market called MetaTrader-5.
The company's cardholders used to make fake IDs on a fake software by taking cash from investors.
This led to the arrest of the accused on the purchase of shares of the investors.
He knew at what price he was going to buy.
In fact, no shares were bought and no transactions were made, because no demat accounts of investors were opened and the shares on this fake software were shown to be false.
Police suspect that hundreds of people have been arrested in connection with the incident.
Every investor was paid between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 5 lakh in the name of making a profit.
The main accused, Amit Soni, has been detained by a cyber cell from Jodhpur while six of his accomplices have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dua, any stock trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only after that, the company will be able to trade shares through its investors.
Then the investor's demat account is opened so that shares can be bought and sold for it, but this company, called MetaTrader-5, was neither associated with any exchange nor made stock trading.
The company purchased the server for itself on September 24, 2012, citing trading in the name of Wintrade.
Since then, people have been fooled by the name of investment through this company.
At present, eight Indore-based traders have come forward to file a complaint in the cyber cell.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profit, their money was not transferred to the account
In this, he started asking for profits from the company's executives.
Investors are even saying that on the fake ID given to them, the price of their purchased shares was always shown lower.
This price was fixed by the accused at their own level.
The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, MP and Maharashtra.
Agents advised people to join the company by lureing more profits.
After this, Rs 2 lakh was deposited from anyone and Rs 5 lakh from anyone.

BJP<0x60>s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of Dinanath Mangeshkar<0x60>s hospital, on Friday launched a scathing attack on the Congress.
"Modi said, ""A coalition government has been formed in many states and at the Centre, sometimes in Congress, sometimes in the Communists, sometimes in the BJP government."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be set in the country.
What did the team do?
If it comes to a comparative result, then the question will not be before the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever the BJP government is formed, there is an attempt to fulfil the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness to the low inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man had to eat two times.
But when the Congress or its support government was formed, the poor man did not get enough food.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader, is responding to what he did in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country cannot reach them.
The Congress has become egotistical.
They don't even respond to the media.
The elections are for the Lok Sabha, you have to answer to the people.
"Modi said, ""Today, questions are being asked to Modi. In 2014, when the people will bless the BJP, they will present their work to the people every year."
In a democracy, not a ruler in Delhi, but a servant should sit.
There can be no Nath in Delhi and there should be only Das.
Friends of the Congress party are leaving the balloons on the day of the event.
Friends of Congress, we have passed the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, people take the test.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are facing financial charges in the Northtel patent case.
The group, owned by thousands of former Nortel patents, has filed several patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone makers, which it had overtaken in the Nortel bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
Rockstar, a consortium that bought Nortel patents for <0x24>4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents.
These patents also include technology that combines search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, which is the main part of Google's search business, the prosecution said.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which rivals Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google had made an initial bid of <0x24>900 million for Nortel patents.
Google finally proposed <0x24>4.4 billion by increasing the bid several times.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for <0x24>12.5 billion, one of the main reasons Motorola had a long list of patents.
"Google has violated, and continues to violate, despite losing its attempt to acquire patents-in-suite in the auction," the indictment said.
Rockstar has sought enhanced compensation against Google, as it claims that the breach of patents by Google is violative.
Egypt's first independent elected president
Mohamed Morsi has sworn in his post, but his victory day was hardly able to end a political conflict in Egypt.
Mohammed Morsi promised "New Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was removed 16 months ago.
On its formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become Egypt's fifth president after the Arab world's free-elected first Islamist president, and the overthrow of the monarchy nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office on his chair on the banks of the Nile River before 18 judges of the court wearing black, which looked like the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and another republic,” Morsi said at the formal ceremony shown in live broadcasts on national television.
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years since its inception as an unlawfully declared organization, and which has been the target of previous governments, 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the party's U.S., said that "Today the Egyptians have laid the foundation for a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building and Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to greet the new president, apart from the whims of the president, the traffic was also stopped for a while, so that his motor convoy would normally leave the busy road that connects the city centre to its southern suburbs.
Morsi's personal prestige, ridiculed as a non-Christian "empty tyre" by the Brotherhood, increased greatly after his victory, and his speech on Friday presented him not only as an Islamist but as a candidate of all who want to complete the task of the 2011 revolution against dictator Mubarak.
Wearing a blue business suit and a red tie Morsi took oath of office before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, saying that "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
Then Morsi went to Cairo University, where he had to deliver his inaugural address.
He was officially welcomed by the military band by playing the national anthem while they stood in a cautionary posture.
Military ruler Field Marshal Husain Tantavi was also present.
Upon his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university there welcomed with the slogan that "the army and people are one hand."
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi on Friday took a symbolic oath at Tahrir Square, the site of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorship last year, and vowed to withdraw presidential powers taken away from the leader removed last year by the military council.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court instead of formally taking the competent oath of Parliament, they bowed to the will of the army, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic popular currencies.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases American espionage has crossed the threshold.

Meanwhile, an important committee of the US Parliament has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
Its aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the trust among the people that has been hurt by the disclosure of large-scale phone tapes.
The move has been welcomed by six US companies, including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also blocked data centers of these companies.
The Senate Select Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill (FISA) on the NSA by four votes against 11.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including a ban on one-time phone tapping under the US Patriot Act.
The FISA will intentionally collect data and use it as an offence and will result in a jail term of ten years.
The bill will become law after the passage of both the Houses of Congress and the Senate.
The NSA's phone recording programme is under law and I believe it has contributed significantly to the security of the country, said Diane Festin, chairman of the committee.
But in spite of this, more transparency should be brought in.
Not only this, the safety of the public should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have supported the bill, angry over the NSA's Internet surveillance program being exposed.
In a letter to senators, the companies said they welcome the proposal of MPs who have curbed the NSA's massive phone recordings.
It is worth noting that former CIA employee Edward Snowden has removed the NSA from the documents.
The international community is outraged by the NSA's telephonic surveillance of 35 heads of state including Germany and France.

According to a recent media report, the NSA used information to spy on Yahoo and Google's data centers.
The Washington Post has revealed this on the basis of documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA's program was called Masculler, which it ran in conjunction with its British counter-part-GCHQ.
The two agencies stole data from Yahoo and Google's giant fiber optic cable network.
The Washington Post quoted a top-secret document dated January 9, 2013 as saying that more than 18 million documents were collected in just three days of the start of the programme.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run out of the US and an anonymous telecommunication provider helped the NSA gain access to this information.
According to the newspaper, it was easier for the NSA to run the program outside of the US, as court orders are required for such operations in the US.
NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied the allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying, "As far as I know, this has never happened.
The NSA has always collected all the information within the ambit of the law.
The NSA was recently a target for the German chancellor's espionage.
The United Nations said on Wednesday that the U.S. administration has assured not to monitor its communications system.

Schools have decided to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar.
Students in English literature courses must read at least a play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story post 1914.
The exam will also include "not seen text" to encourage more reading.
A joint English literature and language course will be abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take a separate GCSEs in language, and there will be a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow – both of which will be the first subjects with revolutionary changes.
It will also change to other major topics next year.
In a separate step, the examinations will demonstrate changes in the structure of GCSEs with regulatory offcule, new grading system, and lower curriculum.
Speaking in the summer, Secretary of Education Michael Gove said that “there was a lot of consensus that, in order to restore people’s faith, we need to improve our examination system,” adding that “GCSE will be “more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies found that English schools devote less time in mathematics — 116 hours a year or — 3 hours a week during the session than most countries.
According to the comparison, Australian schools provide students an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While there would be no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that extensive mathematics was likely to encourage the GCSEs to provide additional teaching in schools by combining them with subjects in the league table.
This course will focus more on "real-world problems" including financial mathematics.

Pawan Bansal, surrounded by opposition questions at the railway gate, said he had not seen a woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised where the woman's story finally came from.
Perhaps Bansal's gesture was towards the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a corporator.
Turning the matter to the other side, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had hatched a conspiracy to lodge a complaint against a woman behind him during the last parliamentary elections, which did not succeed.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said the CBI has questioned him in the railway bribery case.
If they were to testify in the case, would they be made only after the entire investigation?
Bansal said that in the booth scam he had written a letter to only one person in need.
If they are guilty, they will be punished for their sins.
He said although the corporation did not have the constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.

He also said in his speech that there is no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges should be tackled.
The same sentiment was on the face of the Chief Minister that he took Singh’s speech in a positive manner.
Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the workers at Chintan camp and protect them from the alleged harassment of officers.
However, he had also said that he was ready to resign from the cabinet to keep his word.
By the way, a fresh consideration is expected in the matter of placing workers in government posts after the opinion emerged in the Chintan camp.
At the camp, JD(U) president Vashist Narayan Singh had said that the names of the workers in the 20-point committees will be announced soon.
They also indicated that the list was almost ready.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is expected to examine the list at his own level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of MLAs and MPs has been taken in making the list.
If necessary, the list will be revised in a big way to accommodate old and committed workers.
It is a common allegation of legislators and MPs that their opinion was not taken in making the list of nominations.
The names of those who came from other parties much later have been listed, while many important workers who have been active since the days of the Samta Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal by their hard work and people take inspiration from them.

Speaking of Dhirubhai 's first job, he arrived in Yemen's city of Aden from a ship called Kabota at the age of 17 in 1949.
His elder brother Ramaniklal had made all arrangements for him here, so he had no trouble getting a job abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
In 1954, he returned to the country.
In 1955, after putting Rs 500 in his pocket, he tried to reach Mumbai.
And that's where his business journey began.
From here Dhirubhai Ambani took such a step that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At the time, he was the owner of Rs 62,000 crore.
Currently, his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are in charge of the Sultanate.
Like his father, the names of these two brothers are now among the international businessmen.
Who doesn't know the family of Anubis today?

SRINAGAR: The security of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the People's Democratic Party, has been reportedly removed by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying his security had been removed for political reasons.
It may be recalled that Ghulam Hasan Khan, who won the election in 2002 on a PDP ticket from Shopian, was in his cabinet while Mufti Muhammad Sayeed was the chief minister.
Gulam Hasan Khan said, “I have got a security cover since 1996.
I live in a place known as a terrorist camp.
A security team of CRPF was posted at my house under the leadership of Sub Inspector.
There are bodyguards with me, but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Virvar.
When the security force was going from my house, I spoke to the Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he said he would investigate the matter.
However, in this context when contacted, Kashmir IGP Abdul Ghani Mir denied the details of the case, saying it was a sensitive matter.
I myself will examine how the security of a former minister and a senior political leader has been removed.
There is no such thing in my knowledge, state Congress chief Prof Saifuddin Soz said.
If the security of Hasan Khan has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and Kashmir for the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned authorities.
According to the report, during the last four years, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Unlike Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004), there was a period when no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002)
Laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182-metre-high Statue of Unity statue in Kevadiya, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, Earlier there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's Jayanti.
While DAVP records show that the UPA spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements
When asked about Modi's claims, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari said the BJP's PM candidate does not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA did not bring any advertisement on Patel in the year 2008
He said it was because of the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on the advertisements of Sardar Patel is much less than the amount spent on the birthdays and funerals of the Nehru-Gandhi family members every year.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary, Rs 21 crore for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When asked about the difference, Manish Tewari said, It should not be seen from the point of view of expenditure on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including the size of the advertisement or the rate of advertising for that year, etc.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, the people who oppose it are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.
Today, he will meet the families of those killed at a rally in Patna on Sunday.

Moving through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Well is providing free healthcare in rural areas of Cameroon
Wells and his team see hundreds of patients on almost every weekend
West African countries don’t have too many doctors; there’s only one doctor for 5,000 people.
Give your vote here or via mobile.
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in 2013.
You can vote to make CNN a hero of the year for them or someone else in the top 10.
The winner will receive <0x24>250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father consciously and unconsciously, going to the hospital, which was not properly equipped to assist him.
Jaimel Well was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon in 1981.
Initially, he had only broken hands, but an infection increased that spreads to his brain, and he produced blood clots, which affected the rest of his life.
Georges Well says, “There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon.”
If we had the money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well continued to visit his father in a crowded clinic and hospitals and receive whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "It's not easy."
You leave home at 5 a.m. with the hope that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but that does not happen.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people may be able to wait until death.
The situation hasn’t changed much since Well’s father’s death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5,000 people.
If compared, there is a physician for every 413 individuals in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameroon cannot afford to pay for it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of healthcare expenditure in the country is in the private sector.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Well says.
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Well decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He himself became a physician, and began working as a vasculator surgeon at Yonde's Central Hospital.
And they launched the non-profit organization Escovime, which goes to rural areas over the weekend to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday, they and up to 30 people sit in the van, tie medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to push the vehicle more than once by pushing it from the rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they really get the respect of heroes: feasts, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
Free medical services in these villages are indeed a reason to celebrate, and well - with its big smile and endless energy - it involves happiness.
The next morning his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
“We’re meeting 500 people on each trip.”
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get a basakhi, donated glasses or a free birth certificate -- this document is required in school, but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out at school buildings, town halls, or at home; after the procedure, the patient moves on to the recovery site, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generator publishes operating rooms and sanitising equipment, and Well and his volunteers get up early in the morning on Sundays.
It's a waist-breaking pace, but village musicians generally help keep the team motivated.
“They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work,” Well said.
His team returns to the city on Sunday, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group — which includes Cameroonian physicians and foreign medical students — has had 700 free surgeries last year, and they know their support can change the world of people they help.
One person reported that he would be able to go back to work after receiving free hernia surgery.
The man said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running weekend clinics and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Well also works in private medical clinics around the compound at night.
He explained that this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is accomplished by private donations.
Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer at Well's group, said, "I don't know when they sleep."
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so that they keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity they can never get in their country.
“We have been able to gain experimental experience in medical treatments that help us catch the tools for Dr. Well or clean blood stains,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in the US, you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Voluntary students typically spend from their side to reach Cameroon, and they often come up with medical supplies of charity.
But after the twins arrive, they go to stay, and they bear the cost of the instructions.
O’Malley says, “There’s no doubt they’re heroes.”
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For the well, almost the same workload, there is no difficulty.
Helping other people live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that give them a lot of joy.
Well says, “I’m very happy when I do this work.”
And I think about my father.
I hope they see what I’m doing.
I’m doing this to make people laugh, reduce their pain.

"Addressing a rally, Modi said, ""If you look at the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they do not talk about what they have done."
"The Congress has become so egotistical that it doesn't answer the media's questions."
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government is, yet he needs an answer from Modi.
It is your duty to respond to the public.
Clearly, Modi was responding to Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants an environment of control where he gives his speech and does not talk to journalists to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to have a face-to-face debate.
“I promise the people of the country that when the BJP forms the government in 2014, we will present the report to the people every year,” Modi said.

Obama's health care proposal has been withdrawn.
Amid the shower of criticisms, President Obama yesterday retracted his often repeated misleading promise that “you can continue to do so if you like your health plan.”
With millions of people receiving cancellation information from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading U.S. citizens in recent times.
Yesterday, Obama changed his message.
He said in a speech in Boston that “a lot of people who have health insurance, and that’s useful, can continue it.”
Addressing what he calls the repeal, Obama has offered to buy new coverage in the market from U.S. citizens who receive these information.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, as much as money or a comprehensive healthcare plan cheaper than the proposed one.
He said, "You'll find a better deal."
It should come as no surprise that 5 per cent of the population who buys insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans as their coverage is not in line with the required standards under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebalius said, “I tell these American citizens directly, you deserve better than that.”
Sebalius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market has been "unfortunate" since October.
“I’m just as disappointed and angry as other people.”
I want to get your trust again.
Sebalius, from a fellow sitting behind him at a House hearing yesterday after a sharp confrontation with the Republicans, said the sentence in anger, which one Mike caught. Billy Long, R-Mo, about whether he would need to be enrolled in Obamacare.
At a more than three-hour-long hearing, Long repeatedly asked Sebalius why the "register" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which he is now selling to millions of Americans.

In an unannounced confession, John Kerry said that the U.S. espionage "has gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry has signaled the U.S.'s protective attitude softened on his surveillance program by admitting that sometimes its spying "runs too far inappropriately."
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is also guilty of being on "automatic pilot" in the form of an insurgency disclosure to informant Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities.
This revelation has brought the U.S. government to diplomatic strides in its relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “There is no question that the President, me, and others in the government, were really aware of some of the things that happened to the automatic pilot, because, looking back, it had the potential to do so in the difficult years of World War II, and the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11.”
They have become the first high-ranking members of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage has exceeded its limits, but insisting that no one’s rights have been misused.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to make it clear to the people and is now doing a thorough review so that no one feels misused.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Shri Kerry emphasized that, however, NSA was striving for a good cause, and its monitoring work has saved the lives of many.
He further explained: “We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to killing people and attacking governments.
So what's the problem if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We’ve actually saved the plane from falling down, building collapses, and killing people because we’ve been able to know in advance about the plans of others.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said U.S. lawmakers would go to Europe to help address concerns abroad about so-called U.S. espionage, and try to explain to European countries the need to jointly continue anti-corruption efforts with the U.S.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threat of their involvement in anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
Murphy, who was first elected to the Democratic Party and chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview with Washington, "It is really important for U.S. national security interests that European countries are with us in the context of our counterterrorism efforts."
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
The NSA's reports of recording millions of phone conversations in Europe have strained relations with some of the U.S. allies, though the agency's head said the news was not entirely accurate, and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata shared with the United Nations by NATO allies.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden show that the NSA has monitored cellphones from 34 other top leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the espionage incident on allied countries, calling it necessary and said it was common for both sides to do so.
Amid the ruckus, Murphy said his office was arranging a Congress visit which is likely to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and both chambers.
The names of other law-makers participating will be released in the coming days.
He said that the work on the travel programme is still going on.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said some "inappropriate relations" would also have to be abandoned.

A new policy of making board changes in the municipalities has started.
Recently, a team of Congress leader's board councillors in Sanithia municipality of Virbhum district changed to the TMC's board.
The change came as most of the Congress councillors, including the municipal chairman, joined the TMC.
Not only the Congress, but some corporators of the CPI(M), CPI and Forward Bloc have also suppressed the TMC here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy said it was a good sign for the party.
He said 10 Congress councillors, including Sanythia municipal chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, had joined the TMC.
Some councillors of the Left Front, including the CPI(M), have also hoisted the Trinamool flag.
All of them have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the TMC and according to the number force, the Scinthia Municipal Board has also come under the control of the TMC.
Mr Rai also claimed that everyone agrees with the development roadmap of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including Congress, CPI, CPI and Forward Bloc, are moving to join the Trinamool Congress.
Welcome to the Trinamool leaders of any party.
Ahead of the November 22 municipal elections, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) has been taking over the civic board due to the change of party of Congress corporators in the city.
Earlier, the Left-ruled Haldia and Nadia were also examples of the TMC occupying the Congress-ruled municipal board.
In the districts, when the TMC is in control of the municipal board due to change, those who join the party are greeted with a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhawan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited to break away from other parties and join the TMC.
He said that those who break away from any party are welcome in the TMC.
He claimed that under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, people's faith is growing, which is the result of which people want to join the TMC.
However, the main opposition CPI(M) says lower-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated and intimidated.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress in fear.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is a blow to the CPI(M) democracy.
In a democratic manner, any party has the right to increase its mandate, but it is necessary to question the rationale for a change in the power.
Australian woman appeals against Thai jail term
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assaulting her, she has appealed against the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, a provincial court found Stevie Rochelle Bomford guilty of making false allegations against the Thai police, alleging that on Sunday morning, a local taxi driver along with two other persons tried to stop him.
However, later CCTV footage revealed that she had returned to the hotel safely after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
After being questioned by the Phuket police for two days, Bamfort admitted to fabricating the story.
He was kept in the local police custody before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security detention center in the outskirts of Phuket, rather than adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has requested the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to assist her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about the care of their daughter and that they wanted to call her back to Australia.
"No doubt it has been a worrying time for us, but we hope he will be back home as soon as possible," Tunx said.
Bamfod has appealed against the order, and has been granted bail on 50,000 Baht.
Meanwhile, the report in Australia said that she was vacationing at Krabi's holiday site in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford's case was being contested by a local advocate in Phuket, but warned that the court could extend his sentence to two years as a result of the appeal and compel him to stay in adult prison.
Similarly, after the recent killing of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be able to impeach its poor tourist image.
