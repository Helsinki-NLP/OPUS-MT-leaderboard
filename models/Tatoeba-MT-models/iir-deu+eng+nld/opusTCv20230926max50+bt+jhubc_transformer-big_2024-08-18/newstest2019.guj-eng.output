Thousands of farmers reach high court against Gujarat's 'dream project' bullet train
A petition has been filed in the High Court against the acquisition of land from the farmers of Gujarat for the Central Government's Dream Project Bullet Train.
During the hearing of the petition, 1,000 farmers had made an affidavit stating that the state government did not have the right to acquire their land.
A bench of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) had given an ultimatum to the central government that if the central government does not submit a reply on the acquisition of the land on 26th, the court will issue a final order.
The High Court has also appealed to the Centre against the High Court and the Supreme Court order.
Further hearing on the matter will be held on September 26.
The Gujarat High Court on Wednesday moved the state government over objections to the affidavits of over 1,000 farmers in eight districts of Gujarat in the inter-state bullet train project.
You're leading the court.
You said that there are only four to seven farmers in your representation, but a large number of farmers have been sworn in.
Advocate Anand Yagnik, appearing for the farmers, argued that the central government has not submitted a reply in the last three months for the country's most expensive project of Rs 110,000 crore linked to more than one state.
The central government is trying to ensure that the case does not go to the High Court.
Farmers are being threatened by the collector as the last weapon as there is no strong defence of land acquisition by the central or state government.
Blackmail is being used to seize the land as per the new condition.
If the land is not acquired, then there will be a threat of confiscation.
Despite the Supreme Court's order on August 10, the central government did not file a reply in the High Court.
As a result, the farmers will go back to the Supreme Court tomorrow and demand that their order be obeyed.
More than 3,000 farmers from 8 districts of Gujarat will go to Japan to save their land and inform the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) about all the facts about the injustice done to them by the central government.
The agreement with the central government also provides for the cancellation of the agreement if there is injustice with the farmers.
In this regard, the farmers will inform the Gika about a loan of thousands of crores of rupees for the bullet train, following the agreement with Japan's Gika company.
Japan has not yet paid more than Rs 300 crore.

At the international level, China is trying to make the yuan an international currency at the same level as the euro, the yen and the pound, including the dollar.
Given the potential for economic sanctions from the US, India and Russia are exploring the possibility of this deal in rupee and rubles.
New Delhi: India and Russia have signed an agreement on the S-400 defence missile system.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
The S-400 deal is in the process of getting the US dollar to pay for the deal.
Sources claim that India and Russia are exploring the possibility of making the deal in rupee and rubles given the possibility of economic sanctions from the US.
The U.S. has banned China's trade
In September, Russia signed a S-400 missile deal with China.
After the deal, US President Donald Trump decided to ban China.
The ban made it almost impossible for China to buy a missile using the US dollar.
However, over the past few years, China has tried to raise its currency yuan as an international currency against the dollar.
After the initiative, China has been constantly trying to make the yuan an international currency equivalent to the euro, the yen and the pound.
China, on the other hand, has the largest reserves of U.S. dollars in international trade.
China wants to make the yuan an international currency.
This <0x24>5 billion mega defence deal could impose a US-based CAATSA (Countering American Adversaries Through Secession).
Last month, the US imposed a ban on the purchase of S-400 missile systems from China.
India and Russia had already started establishing an alternative mechanism for this deal.
Earlier, due to the US ban on the repair deal of INS Chakra taken on lease from Russia, an estimated <0x24>2 billion deal between India and Russia was struck.
The Economic Analyst claims that India should exercise the deal by using the rupee-rubble exchange as an international currency to come out of such a situation.
It is worth noting that all the defence deals made by India with Russia so far have been made through dollars.
Why did the U.S. Constitution become law?
In August, President Donald Trump approved Russia's modern defense missile system, a law designed by the United States to prevent Russia from acting against the interests of the United States at the international level.
It is worth noting that the U.S. law has been prepared keeping in mind Russia's activities.
This includes Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, its involvement in the Syrian civil war, and interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Then suddenly, thousands of years ago, a mysterious secret came to light.
Description: This story is about a man from Turkey who made a big discovery in repairing the house.
When the wall of his basement collapsed, he collided with a secret door.

This city's pictures show how around 20,000 people lived in this underground city with all their belongings and food items.
600 gates to enter the city:
The incident took place in 1963 when a Turkish man living in Kaippadossia discovered the underground city.
The wall of his basement collapsed while repairing the house.
From here, an underground city named Darinyuku, located at a depth of 280 feet, was found.
The 18-storey building was perfect.
This underground city was sometimes home to 20,000 people, with preparations for everything from rooms, kitchens, schools, churches, tombs, etc., including ventilation.
There are 600 gates to enter and exit the city.
There are a lot of doors that are designed to stop people from entering the city.
Each of its floors can be closed separately.
The city is believed to have been built between 780 and 1180 AD during the Secondin period to protect the people from wars and natural disasters between the Arabs and the Secondin.
It has become a tourist attraction:
Derinkuyu is not the only underground city in the world.
There are several other such cities but this is the largest underground city in the world.

The petition also asked, "Where was the village of Lord Krishna?"
Where did you get the greens?
Chhattisgarh: An RTI activist from Chhattisgarh has sought some kind of information about the birth of Lord Krishna, his village, the greens of the Vajraj by him in Mathura district.
At the moment, it is difficult to respond to the RTI query.

Jainand Gandle, an RTI activist from Gamma village of Bilaspur Janpad in Chhattisgarh, has questioned the Mathura district administration by inserting an RTI.
It has been written in the RTI that on September 3, a holiday was declared across the country to celebrate the birth anniversary of Lord Krishna.
For this purpose, the birth certificate of Lord Krishna will be provided.
This is to show that he was born on this day.

He raised the king's bronze and did many greenery in the place before Dwarka Gamana.

The Supreme Court's decision today, whether or not namaz is an integral part of Islam in the mosque
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court is likely to pronounce its verdict on Thursday on a petition filed by a Muslim group seeking reconsideration by a larger bench of the Supreme Court on the 1994 verdict on the rights of the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid owner.
The High Court had said in its verdict that namaz is not an integral part of Islam in the mosque.
Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer will pronounce their verdict on the bench.
He was released on July 20th.
M Siddiqui, a fundamentalist in the Ayodhya case, objected to this particular conclusion in the 1994 decision in the case of M. Ismail Faruqui.
According to him, the mosque is not an integral part of the prayer offered by the followers of Islam.
Siddique has died and is represented by his legal heir.
The Muslim community has argued before the bench headed by the Chief Justice that the decision requires reconsideration by a five-member bench on the observation of the High Court.
Because its Babri Masjid - Ram temple, land dispute will have an impact.
Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for a legal representative of the Siddique, said that the mosque is not an integral part of Islam.
This comment was made by the High Court without any scrutiny or consideration of religious books.
The Uttar Pradesh government had told the apex court that some Muslim communities have been trying to delay the long-delayed Ayodhya temple-majority land dispute, demanding a reconsideration of the remarks on the non-representation of an integral part of Islam.
Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the UP government, said the dispute had been waiting for a final decision for almost a century.
Rupee's biggest fall in rupee so far, closes at 71 against dollar
The rupee today fell by 26 paise to a low of 71 rupees in early trade as demand for the dollar rose amid rising crude oil prices.
The rupee opened at Rs 70.95 in the interbank foreign exchange market yesterday and then moved up to Rs 71.
The rupee closed at 70.74 on Thursday.
According to traders, strong demand from oil importers towards the end of the month, the strengthening of the dollar against other major currencies in the world in the hope of rising interest rates amid trade tensions between China and the US has affected the domestic currency.
The rise in crude oil prices has also affected the rupee, with the prospect of inflation rising and the export of foreign institutional investors in the domestic shear market.
At the beginning of the Asian trade, the standard Brent crude price reached <0x24>78 a barrel.
In his first visit to the city, the minister gave a message to the people of the
New Delhi: Prithvi Shaw has made centuries in his Test match debut.
The Earth is being compared to Sachin Tendulkar.
In the same way that the Earth has played a big innings at the school level, the Minister has also been in the discussion of the playing of the innings.
Sachin Tendulkar took to Twitter and congratulated Prithvi Shaw on his 100th birthday.
In his first visit to the city, the minister took a look at the world's
Sachin Tendulkar was also happy with the start of the season.
The minister also praised the country.
He remembered the day when he first saw the earth, and what he had to say to her.
About 10 years ago, his friend Jagdish Chauhan once asked me to watch the earth-shattering batting.
"This young player wants to meet you and it would be better if you could meet him," Chawhan said.
A friend of a friend came over to see him and asked him to take a seat.
"He still remembers that he told his friend that this child would one day play for India," he told the secretary, "he told his friend that you are looking at the future Indian cricketer."
A friend of mine said, "Are you telling the truth?"
"Remember my words to you, this child will play for India.
He told the world about the biggest earthquake in the world.
"I've seen the world, I've seen it, I've seen it, I've learned it very quickly.
Having a talent in a player is a different thing, but if you do that talent, it's more important.
If you want to be successful in international cricket, you need to be able to learn quickly.
Different grounds and conditions require adaptability (the ability to play depending on conditions) to play for a long period of time.
I think the Earth Shaa has the ability to play with the account of the game in different situations and this is the greatest strength of the Earth.
The minister said that the earth is the codification of the hands and eyes of Shea.
The way he grabs the ball line and the length of the ball, such are found in very few players.
This is the natural gift of the earth, which does not belong to many players.

How can the language of Sultan Mahmood Ghazni of Ghazni, who is the Bhanjak of Somnath Temple and a villain for the common Indian, be Sanskrit?
In fact, the research by Shanta Pandey, a professor of history at Delhi University, has made it clear that Ghazni's official language was Sanskrit.
At present, when Shri Somnath Trust honoured Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their service to Sanskrit, it was natural to question whether Sanskrit was only the language of the so-called upper class Brahmins.
Mumbai's Pandit Ghulam Dastgir Birajdar is remembered.
The 87-year-old Pandit Birajdar, who speaks in a simple Sanskrit that can understand the rickshaws, is still finalising the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Qur'an before its publication.
The Holy Qur'an is a Sanskrit word.
<0x58>-rays are the sounds or sounds that are heard on the surface of the earth.
Not only did he study at the Pathshala in Solapur, today he is considered one of the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the country.
However, Panditji, who has lived a simple life, doesn't want to give lectures as a Sanskrit Pandit in the US or other countries to market himself.
The princess of Thailand is a Pandit of Sanskrit.
There's a smattering of self-doubt there.
In order to learn Sanskrit from the US, they have to go to Bonn University in Germany.
Even a Masters of Sanskrit in most universities other than Banaras Hindu University in India which is written in the language of that State.
In Gujarat, Sanskrit is taught only in Gujarat, but it should be remembered that education in Takshashila and Nalanda universities was imparted through Sanskrit medium.
Prof. Shanta Pandey, a proponent of Sanskrit in Afghanistan, has said that the language spoken by the Sultan of Ghazni was not only Sanskrit, but he also noted that his money coins were inscribed in Sanskrit.
Pande also noted that the coins "Mahmoud Suratran" contained the imports of the Qur'an in Sanskrit and that Panini, the creator of the grammar of Sanskrit, was a resident of Shalapur, Afghanistan.
Pandit Nehru, in a major chapter in "The Darshan of My Hind," has said that the Pashto language of Afghans and Pathans has descended from Sanskrit in "The Power and Sustainability of Sanskrit."
Today, it is accepted that not only Indian languages, but also Indo-European languages have come from Sanskrit.
It is yet another wonder that Dr. Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and some other Muslim and South Indian members of the Constituent Assembly proposed to make Sanskrit the national language of the country.
On September 13, 1949, when the English versus Hindi was discussed in the Constituent Assembly, Deputy External Affairs Minister Dr. B.V.Keskar and Nazruddin Ahmed were among those who proposed the national language to Sanskrit.
The discussion of that day and the report published in the "National Herald" on 11 September 1949, presumptuously suggests the emergence of the Sanskrit language.
Even today, we have not been able to define a national language.
22 Indian languages including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu have a place in our Constitution as the official language, but the national language is not the same.
According to the 2011 Census, Sanskrit as the mother tongue of only 24,821 people of the country is now the only place we have put Sanskrit in a state like the Ganthiya of Shobha.
The Honourable Prime Minister of Sanskrit, Nehru, also spoke respectfully about Sanskrit in the Constituent Assembly.
In the relevant chapter of his book, it has been translated into Sanskrit, and scholars of the world have explained the importance of Sanskrit: "In the year 1874, Sir William Jones said, "God knows how ancient the Sanskrit language is, but its composition is amazing."
It is more complete than the Greek, more abundant than Latin, and more literate than both.
Nehru further notes: "I don't know how many times Sanskrit has become a dead language, that is, since it has become a folk language."
At present, Sanskrit is the only language to be administered by members such as Union Minister Smriti Irani as MPs.
We need to celebrate the year of Sanskrit and make it a living and a people language.
If Israel's dead language can be revived Hebrew, Sanskrit is still a living language.
It is important to try to make it a language rather than a language.
After welcoming him at the airport, who asked him to accompany him?
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was received at Ahmedabad airport.
At that time, leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, were present.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on his way to Anand after his meeting with the leaders.
WhatsApp users can't do this more than 5 times, the feature will soon be available.
WhatsApp is going to bring a big feature for its users.
The company has said that it is going to limit forwarding messages to up to five users to prevent fake news and misinformation in India.
