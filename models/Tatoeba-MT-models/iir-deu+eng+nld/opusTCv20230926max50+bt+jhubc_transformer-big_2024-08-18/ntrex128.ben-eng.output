Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about putting themselves ‘like a map’
Several members of the Assembly are working on changing their positions in the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this fear is the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of various political parties are concerned about the change of name.
A Labour party member said his team was worried that "the new title matched the rhythm with Twp and PwP."
For readers outside of Welsh: in Welsh, Twp means fool and Pwp means mall.
A Played Assembly member said they as a team were "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said the party was "openly thinking" about the name change, but noted that the pronunciation difference between MWP and the measure was small.
In this sense, the pronunciation of the wesh color w is similar to the pronunciation of the yorkshire English u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently enacting legislation to initiate the name change process, said: “The members must make a final decision on what will be the details of the designation of the members of the Assembly.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of a popular vote in which the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament was overwhelmingly supported.
Regarding the terms of the Assembly members, the Commission is supporting the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the MWP has received the most support in the population.
Apparently, assembly members are suggesting a different option, but it will be difficult for the presiding officer, Elon Jones, to reach a consensus, which is expected to submit drafts of the provision within a few weeks.
The reform provision will include changes to the procedures of the Assembly, including disqualification of members of the Assembly and design of the committee system.
After discussing this provision, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to cast a final vote on what their titles should be.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was held in neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia, to avoid decades of conflict.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbour's name is a symbol of establishing claims over their territory and has repeatedly objected to the country's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Giorz Ivanov, who opposes a referendum on the name change, said he would reject the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, felt that the name change was only a necessary step to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's fruit bells silent as the churches of Harlem continue to smoke
"The elderly people I've talked to say that historically each corner had a church and a bar," Mr Adams said.
"There's nothing today."
He said it was a good idea to go to the bathroom.
Nowadays, social media is used in different ways.
"The toilets are no longer the sitting rooms of the area where everyone goes on a regular basis."
In the case of the church, he is concerned that the money sold to the property will not last as long as the leaders think, “and will go back to where they started today and tomorrow.”
He added that apartment buildings and condominiums could be built in place of the church where people would live who would not help the rest of the places of worship in the area.
“The majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings will be whitewashed,” he said, “and so they will accelerate the closing of these churches because most of the people who live in this condominium are less likely to be members of the church.”
Both churches were established by the White Congregation before Harlem became a black-dominated metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martins a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left the church in 1930.
A black congregation near the temple took ownership of the building.
A black congregation under Rev. John Howard Johnson took over St. Martin's, who led a boycott against retailers on A Hundred and Twenty-Fifty Street for refusing to provide jobs and promote black workers — a major road to shopping in Harlem.
The building was badly damaged in a fire accident in 1939, but when the Parish residents of Father Johnson planned to restore it, they arranged for the carillon to be built.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly named Carolyn the "poor man's bell."
The expert Caroline who played it last July called it something different: "a historical asset" and "unprecedented historical musical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Nyong of the University of Michigan, also said that it was the Earth's orthodox carillon served by a black pigeon, played by Dionio A. Linde, who was hired 18 years ago to play a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Marriott said that St. Martins did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's over the past few months is a complex case of architects and contractors appointed by the church's general leaders or episopal diocese.
Vestry – the governing body of Paris, which consists of general leaders – reported their concern last July that they thought Diocese would “transfer the cost” of Vestry, although Vestry was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by Diocese.
Some members of the parish have complained of a lack of transparency in the work of dialysis.
A 13-year-old girl was injured in a shark attack after being drowned in California to catch a shrimp
A 13-year-old boy was injured in a shark attack after he sank to catch a shrimp on the first day of the Gulda shrimp season on Saturday, officials said.
The attack took place at 7 a.m. on Beacons Beach near the NCNitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB TV he heard the boy screaming for help when he drowned with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, paddled up there and helped him get out of the water with a group of people.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was joking with the pleasure of catching an ass shrimp, but then "understand that the boy was yelling at me, 'He bites me!'"
“It has hit me!”
"His voice was broken," Hammel said, and he saw the boy approaching.
"I scream for everyone to get out of the water: 'There are sharks in the water!'" Hamel added.
The boy was airlifted to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
Species of sharks have not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gilles said a shark appeared in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not identified as a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper part of his leg.
Officials have banned entry to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casablanca for 48 hours on the grounds of investigation and security.
There are more than 135 shark species in the area, most of which are not dangerous.
Censorship plans to enter the UK market
Sensbaris Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams are going to compete in the store's business, including an island decorated with cosmetics and expert support staff, like a department store.
As part of a strong effort to enter the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion currency market, these large variants will be launched in 11 stores across the country and will be launched in other stores if proven to be successful. The UK’s currency market is growing where the fashion and home furnishing essentials market has fallen.
This investment is coming as supermarkets are once looking for new ways to fill shelves with TVs, microwaves, and home decor.
SensBaris said it would double its morphology content to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Easy, Tweederman and Dr. Poe for the first time.
The already existing cosmetic ranges such as L'Or<0xC3><0xA9>al, Mebelin, and Barts Biz will have more space that will have a separate space for brands like Boots.
The supermarket is launching its boutique makeup range so that most of the products are vegan friendly – which has become very popular among young buyers.
In addition, Perfume Seller The Fragrance Shop will run a product delivery test at two Sonsbaris stores, the first of which was launched last week in Kiddon, South London, and the second at Sale Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Buying small amounts of food in online shopping and local grocery stores means supermarkets have to make an extra effort for the buyer's gathering.
Mike Cooper, chief executive of Sensburys, said the outlets would look like a department store since the supermarket chain is competing with discount shops like Aldi and Lidl and will have more services and food-free products.
SensBaris has been setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores since he bought Argos and Habitats chains two years ago, and has also opened a few Habitats, which has increased sales of grocery products and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempts to manipulate the supermarket and pour the pharmacies department have failed.
Sensbaris tested a joint project with the first Fike Boots in the 2000s, but the project was halted due to conflict over how the profits from the chemist's store would be shared.
Sensbaris is using the new strategy after selling its 281-storey pharmacy business Lloyds Pharmacy to Selesio.
The company said that by adding a luxurious range of skincare brands, Lloyds will play a role in the plan, including La Roche Pose and Visi in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Business Director of Censbaris, said: "We have changed the rice drums of our islands to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in hiring specially trained personnel who will be present for advice.
Our brand range has been designed to meet all kinds of needs and due to the attractive environment and convenient location, we have now become a reliable fashion destination that will challenge the old methods of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘fires’ after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
TV presenter Holly Willoughby Marks and Spencer and ITV have reportedly cancelled a deal with the lifestyle brand of Dragons Den' star Peter Jones to focus on his new contract.
They don't have time for their home furnishings and customized brand trolleys.
The pair's business is compared to Ginette Paltrow's Gup brand.
This morning's guest, 37, informed her about her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Dean's star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their exciting lifestyle brand business at the last minute — aimed at focusing on her new bumper contract with Marx & Spencer and ITV.
Jones became a "firebrand" when in an interview with the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, the TV's son-in-law admitted that he had no time for his new deal - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - due to the fact that he doesn't have time for his household goods and passion brand trolley.
The business was compared to Ginath Paltrow's Gup brand and was expected to double Willow's net worth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After the news of his departure from Truley on Instagram, Willowy, 37, Jones left the UK by pressing a jet plane for his holiday residence.
A source said: "Till now, the trolley was at the top of the list of Halli's predominant.
It was part of his long-term future plan that would meet his economic needs for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw was a surprise to everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe that the project was due to be launched soon.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse-filling product that is ready for sale."
Experts believe Day Morning, one of Britain's most reliable stars, could lose the firm's million pounds due to its departure as they have already invested heavily in products such as candles, clothing and household items, and a possible delay in its opening will add to this loss.
This can lead to the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willowby and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for over a decade.
Willowy started trolling with Cap in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as president in March.
The duo are vacationing together and Jones owns 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPhertlin as the host of ITV's I Am at the Celebrity event.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business dealings."
"We're in love and then we're in love"
He joked that after expressing a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader and making a comment that some people would consider "non-presidential."
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "news presenter" voice.
"I didn't give up."
He reported that Kim is looking forward to meeting for the second time since his initial meeting in Singapore in June, with Trump claiming his first meeting was a huge step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But talks on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the United States could not see any "related response" to North Korea's previous denuclearization measures.
He added that the United States has imposed sanctions on the use of force.
Trump expressed a more positive outlook during his rally speech.
"We are in a good position with North Korea," he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
It could have killed millions of people.
Now we have a good relationship."
He claims his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results – which has drawn the end of rocket testing, helping to release prisoners and bring the rest of the American workers back home.
And he supported his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to behave, but there were only 200 people standing in this crowded Arena instead of trying to get 10,000 people out there," Trump pointed at the crowd in front of him.
An island devastated by a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia, killing hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a precursor to international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have very clearly stated that they are not requesting international cooperation, so the matter is challenging," Mr. Sambong said.
While a team is gathering to go to Save the Children's Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign workers will be able to work on the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether foreign companies would be given the opportunity to participate in relief efforts.
In the wake of Indonesia's frequent earthquakes, the country is not prepared to deal with the anger of nature.
Although a tsunami shelter has been built in Ache, other coastal areas have seen a fair share of shelters.
Despite the warning, the apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, probably has had an impact on the back of the loss of life.
Traveling to many islands in Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters have made the communication system more vulnerable.
A ship deployed to Lombok is on its way to the hospital, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put Indonesia's infrastructure development at the center of his election campaign and he has invested huge sums of money in the construction of roads and railways.
But the lack of investment before next year's re-election has gripped Mr. Jokowi's government.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from Indonesia's longstanding communal tensions, where Muslim figures have adopted a more conservative lifestyle of their religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than ten thousand were left homeless in clashes between Christians and Muslims, with two groups fighting on the streets with dams, arrows, and other armored weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Streisy's beautiful goal in match against Chelsea
On Saturday, Daniel Streis Liverpool was rescued by Chelsea in the Premier League by a 89-minute goal at Stamford Bridge in London.
Zardan Shakir's pass was received by his team 1-0 while he was 30 metres away from Starz Chelsea goalpost.
He took the ball first to the left and then took a shot at the remote post.
The shot goes to the right corner of the net at the top of the box.
In the end, the ball crossed the cape Arizabalaga and entered the net.
"It's important to get to the right position to catch the ball on time, because players like Shack always extend the ball as much as possible before, so I was trying to give myself as much time as possible," Starz told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I look at Kante to make a note of coming forward and don't think too much of a shot."
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in half-time as Belgian star Aden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute of the game.
The Blues striker also passed Kovacich, then ran away from midfield and entered Liverpool's Hafe.
Kovacich went ahead with the ball in the midfield.
He then gave a beautiful ball to Hazard in the box in Liverpool's defense chair.
Hazard lost the defense's players to a run and reached the left leg in a remote post trap.
Napoli will take on Liverpool in the group stage match of the Champions League at San Polo in Naples on Wednesday at 3pm.
Videoton will face Chelsea UEFA Europa League in London at 3pm on Thursday.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the wreckage of the 7.5-magnitude building, which hit on Friday and caused a 20-foot-tall flood, the company's spokesman Sutopo Puro Naugaro said at a Sannabad conference.
The city of Palu, which is home to 380,000 people, is full of ruins.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing a woman
A murder investigation was launched this morning after the body of a woman was found in Barkenhead Mercedes.
The body of a 44-year-old woman who was stabbed to death was found at John Street's Grayson Muse at 7:55 a.m. this morning, a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area to inform them if they see or hear anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I appeal to anyone around John Street in Barkenhead to contact us if they see or hear anything suspicious.
I appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have any footage on the dash camera, to contact us because they may have the necessary information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim was a resident of Barkenhead and his body was found inside a house.
Friends, who think this woman is known to them, came to the scene and asked where the woman's body was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they are trying to inform the woman's relatives.
When a taxi driver tried to enter his flat in Grayson, police told him that no one was allowed to enter the building or leave the building.
He was shocked to hear about the incident.
Residents of the building have been told that it will take several hours for them to enter.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a place of crime.
A woman came to the scene crying.
He said: “It’s very sad.
At 2 pm, two police vans were inside the barricade and another van was outside the barricade.
A group of police officers were inspecting the block of flats inside the barricade.
If anyone has any information, they are requested to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC directly or to call 101 or anonymously call Log 247 on September 30, at Crimestoppers.
Parliament’s Chromwell statue ‘history rewrites’ new victim
The statue will be removed after the Taliban's systematic destruction of many of England's cultural and religious icons at the hands of his religious hardline followers.
But the Cromwell Society referred to Mr. Crick's advice as "absoluteness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "The statue of Oliver Cromwell set outside Westminster Palace in the current stage of the removal of the statue was inevitable.
The destruction of iconoclasm or artifacts during the English Home War was not performed by or by Cromwell's order.
In the previous century, the statue of the wrong chromowell will be demolished in the work of his predecessor Thomas.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, created by Sir William Hamo Thornecroft, is part of a 19th-century view and a historical character that many people consider worthy of celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people view Cromwell as the protector of parliament under external pressure, in his case, against the pressure of the monarchy – which is now the opinion of less people, but many in the 19th century.”
But this is part of the ongoing historical debate as to whether it is a completely accurate picture of the time.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a known character who represents a party to this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
The dog killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media reports, a pig was attacked and killed by a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, who has only been identified as "Yuan," was found near a pig stubble in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province in southern China in a blood clotting and blood clotting condition, a report from the South China Morning Post said on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig herder in Shining, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm.
He, along with his brother Fupato, came to the market on Wednesday for the sale of 15 pigs from the nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and saw the door of a pig stubble on the side open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the Astobal with blood on his face.
A forensic examination confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds had attacked the farmer, the report said.
"My uncle's legs were bleeding and injured," Fupato said, citing his surname "U," Guiyang Evening News reported.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The dog that killed the man is not the man or his brother.
A market manager told Evening News that the police were collecting ammunition at the scene and the pig was kept separately so that it could not attack anyone else.
Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating to determine the amount of compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been cases of swine attacks before.
In 2016, a woman and her husband attacked a pig in their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig, Exxon Welsh, pushed the farmer into his tractor until his wife came and drove the pig out of fear.
After a farmer in Oregon ate his pig in 2012, Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but can act as a "trigger or stimulant" to taste blood.
"They're just messing up.
They make small bites, very interesting animals... but they don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to deal with them enough," he said.
The remainder of the hurricane rosacea will cause heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening the storm's strength as it moves over cooler waters in Mexico's northern coastal region.
However, in the coming days, due to rosacea, there will be heavy flooding in the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
At 5am on Sunday, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with a speed of 85 miles per hour, and 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
We're heading north on Sunday.
In this direction, a strait in the Pacific Ocean has begun to form and is moving towards the West Coast of the United States to the east. On Monday, Rosa Baha will hit the California peninsula as a seasonal storm and push deep tropical humidity towards the southwestern United States to the north.
It is expected to rain up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then it will connect to the system of deep tropical humidity and create heavy rains in the coming days across the south-western region.
The dangerous flash flooding or sudden flooding caused by rain from 1 to 4 inches locally will cause flooding, landslides, and possible landslides in the desert.
Due to deep tropical humidity, rainfall at different places may range from 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely to occur in parts of the southwest, especially in most parts of Arizona.
Flash flooding and the degradation of the situation very quickly is possible due to the dilapidated speed of the tropical rain.
It would be foolish to walk in the desert in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Due to heavy rains, canyons can become dangerous rivers and there will be strong winds, including dust, due to thunderstorms.
Heavy rains are likely to occur locally in parts of the southern California coast.
Rainfalls like these can be as high as half an inch, which can cause small debris to flow on the glossy roads.
This will be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
There may be some scattered tropical rain in Arizona from Sunday night and Monday morning, followed by a rise in rainfall and spread throughout the region from Monday night to Tuesday.
The heavy rain will reach the fore corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
In October, there may be some extreme temperature changes in different parts of the United States as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropical temperatures are still quite warm.
This can sometimes result in dramatic changes in temperature within a short distance.
Sunday is a great example of a dramatic change in temperature in the central United States.
The difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer temperatures will try to rise and spread again.
Most parts of the United States are expected to warm in October, with temperatures ranging from the southern plains to the northeast.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average temperature.
Our long-lasting climate forecasts suggest that in the first half of October, temperatures in the eastern United States are much more likely to be above average temperatures.
More than 20 million people have seen Bret Cavern's hearing.
The sensational testimony of Supreme Court-nominated Brett Cavanna and Christine Blazi Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, took place in the 1980s, saw more than 20 million viewers across six television networks on Thursday.
In this direction, political disputes continue, with broadcasters suspending regular shows due to Friday's last-minute surprise: a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that will give the FBI a week to investigate allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Cavannah was drunk at a high school party and tried to open her clothes.
Kavina said in an emotional testimony that she was 100 percent sure that the incident did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people mentioned in Nielsen's report saw Friday's activity.
The company was accounting for the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, which broadcast the program, were not available as well as the number of visitors, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems with the quality of the audience sitting in the office.
The number of viewers of the event was equal to the playoffs of football or the Academy Awards.
The Fox News Channel, whose views have been strongly supported by the show's presenters, attracted the highest number of viewers across all networks broadcasting hearings throughout the day, with an average of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS saw 3.1 million, NBC watched 2.94 million, MSNBC watched 2.89 million and CNN watched 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
Even after the hearing, there was still interest.
Flake was the central character of today's play.
After the mid-republic's office said in a statement that he would vote for Cavannah, he was caught on camera by CNN and CBS on Friday morning when he climbed up the elevator to reach the Judiciary Committee's hearing and protesters shouted for him.
He held his head down for a few minutes in front of the protesters, broadcasting live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think Kavina is telling the truth to the country?"
She is told, "You have the power, when many women are helpless."
Flake said his office made a statement and said before the lift was closed that he had more to say in the committee's hearing.
Later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Cavannah's nomination to the full Senate vote, all of the cable and broadcast networks broadcast live.
But Flake said he would vote on the condition that the FBI would investigate charges against the nominee next week, which were requested by minority Democrats.
His talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Cunn, have partially affected Flack's decision.
After talking to Kun, Flake spoke to a few more senators and reached his decision.
Flack's decision was bleak, as it was clear Republicans had no vote to approve Cavanna, except for the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation based on allegations against Cavanna.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU of playing "political games" about Britain's future and disregarding the nation's interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview published next to his interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to criticize May's so-called checkers plan for Brexit, saying Britain and the European Union offered to collect each other's revenues "completely unreasonable."
Wed Sims shooting: Police arrest Dayton Simpson, suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Batton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released videos of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say he lost his glasses at the time of the shooting.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and reported that Simpson's DNA was found in the glasses, CBS' associate WAFB said in a report.
After Simpson was arrested, police said he had confessed to killing Wade.
According to The Advocate's report, his bail amounted to <0x24>350,000.
The office of the post-mortem investigator in the East Baton Rouge area released a preliminary report on Friday, citing injuries caused by gunshot wounds to the head and neck as a cause of death.
The department is credited with helping the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the area's residents investigate what led to the arrest of the accused.
LSU's athletic director Joe Aleva thanked the law enforcement agency in the area for its "irresolved efforts and pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in the 6-foot 6-inch-high forward baton Rouge, where his father played basketball for Wayne and LSU.
Last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "extremely shocked" and "horrible" at Wade's death.
"It's always a matter of concern," Wade said.
Volcanic eruptions in Mexico City
The volcanic eruptions from the popocetpet volcano have reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Response Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcanic eruption after increasing the activity of the volcano's mouth and reaching 183 on the scale of gas and volcanic eruptions within 24 hours.
The center was observing a number of thunder and squalls.
Images posted on social media showed the car windshield collapses in areas like Joachimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake that shook Mexico in September 2017, just 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital.
The volcano known as "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
Catalan separatists clash with police ahead of Independence Day celebrations
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in clashes with pro-independence police, when they joined opposition protesters to celebrate the first year of the vote, centering on Catalonia's independence.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs, and coloured powders at them in the face of police blockade, causing black clouds on the streets, which are usually filled with tourist gatherings.
Later in the day, the police used sticks to stop the violence.
For a few hours, freedom fighters chanted "Never Forget, Forgive Not" and faced unity supporters who chanted "Spain Long Live."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries due to the protests, local media reported.
Tensions have been brewing in the freedom-loving region since Madrid declared the October 1 referendum illegal.
The lion's share of voters voted in favor of independence, although the number of voters was low because the majority of the people opposed secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed in violent clashes with police last year as they were prevented from voting during last year's polls across the region.
The freedom fighters were on the streets all night on Friday to block demonstrations in favour of the National Police.
The protesters continued their activities but were forced to go on different roads.
The 68-year-old Narcissist Termis, a power worker who participated in the separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
"Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
"I was happy to be able to vote, I saw water coming in my parents' eyes, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite significant but narrow victories in last December's provincial elections, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain their continuity where many of their well-known leaders are waiting for their organization's role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence to be voluntarily exiled or detained for trial.
A 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who is recording the protest in support of the police on his phone, said politicians from both sides created the controversy.
He said: "The situation is getting worse day by day.
Orioles Juncker, one of the Catalan leaders who is not in a pre-trial prison on Saturday, announced at the end of last year that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
“The best way to prevent the suppression and oppression of democratic values from the Spanish government is to be a candidate for the European election,” he said.
London: Man arrested after car collision with house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after being repeatedly hit by a car in a home in London.
The incident took place at the Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 pm.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blimings said the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car may be hit and cross.
Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers in the Manger goal.
Dolly Manger scored his first goal for Livingston.
Steven Gerard's second defeat in 18 games as the director of the Ibrox Club was a stupendous blow to the promoted Livingston Rangers.
Dolly Menger scored the goal as Gary Holt's team equalled the second goal with the Hibernians.
As a result, Gerard's team left without winning an ace in the Premiership this season and next Sunday they will face the Hearts at the top, eight points ahead of them.
Earlier on Thursday, the Rangers will host Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, who has already extended their unbeaten run in the division to six games, has not yet tasted defeat by head coach Holt, who came last month in place of Kenny Miller.
Livingston missed a lot of chances against his unconvincing opponent.
Holt's team should have been ahead of them long before they scored, since their aggressive attitude created all sorts of problems for Rangers!
Scott Robinson went ahead with the defense, but failed to yield to his own efforts, when Alan Lithgow simply managed to run his effort through the woods after sliding to meet Craig Halke's header.
The hosts were letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that the guests could have trouble in the set-piece.
And that was the key goal.
Rangers made a free-kick consignment and opened the Livingston goal account. Declan Gallagher and Robinson came together to set up Menga, who scored from the center of a touch box.
At this stage, Rangers were dominated by the ball, but they were treating the hosts' defense as invincible, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly spent most of the time in the fray.
The series continued even in the second half, though Alfredo Morlos pulled a shot from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was defeated at the foot of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and won another setpiece for Livingstone from Lithgow Wide.
Crosses were constantly coming into the Livingston box and were also constantly being cleared, although two penalties were claimed - alternative Glenn Middleton after the challenge of the helmet and for the handball - were dismissed.
" Incredible Lifestone - Analysis
Lamont Tony Makarni Arena in the BBC Scotland
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
To someone, they were great, continuing to exceed everyone's expectations at their own upward motion.
Their style of play and players have seldom changed since returning to the top level, but the credit has to go to Holt for the way he has united the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket was outstanding, created an excellently organized defense, and always kept Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Warlock in check.
The rangers, however, were less inspirational.
They were as good as they were under Gerard.
They lacked a final ball - only once they opened up to the hosts - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who are now at the mid-table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception at Cologne
The situation was very happy as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for a Brexit meeting on September 29.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at repairing ties between NATO allies.
They discussed human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police have made security arrangements to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opposition protesters - many of whom were Kurdish - condemned both Erdogan's policies and his decision to welcome him to the country in Germany.
This conflict demonstration proves that a visitor is praised as a hero by the German Turks and condemned by others as dictators.
Deptford road accident: Bike rider killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the link between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped the car and the cyclist was given first aid, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred again a few months after another bike accident on Children's Street, which is located a mile away from the site of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his next-door relative.
Buses have been blocked and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in the chaos.
Six police officers were injured in the high-security men's prison chaos, the Prison Office said.
Clashes broke out at HMP Long Lantern in Orchestershire around 9:30am on Sunday.
Specialist "tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the chaos, including eight prisoners who are included in a branch.
Officers at the scene were treated for injuries to the face.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lantern.
Six members of the staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be taken under the law and they will spend a longer time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lantern has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator had gone to the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, riot officers were called to prison to deal with a serious chaos where staff were attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City. (although drought prone areas may benefit)
The tropical depression is rare in Arizona, but it seems to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa will swoop with its remaining strength across the southwestern desert, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Department has already issued flash flood watches to cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, including South and East Nevada, West Arizona, and Utah, for Monday and Tuesday.
Roza is expected to reach directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and with rain towards the end of Monday.
The National Meteorological Department of Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or low-pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since the 1950s!"
Katrina (1967) which was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center forecasts rainfall from 2 to 4 inches, the Moglon Rim in Arizona, which can be up to 6 inches in isolated amounts.
Other regions of the southwestern desert, including Central Rockies and Great Basin, have a chance of rain from roughly 1 to 2 inches, which can be up to 4 inches in isolated amounts.
The rainy season can be a blessing for those outside the flood risk as the areas are drier.
Although the flooding is a very serious concern, it will likely be beneficial to some extent as the southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, according to Weather.com, the second-highest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path will cause landslides across Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
The fast, which is still a strong hurricane, is moving at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and 12 miles north every hour.
The storm is making headway as it faces cold water in the Pacific Ocean.
So, there is expected to be a landslide in Mexico in the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rains are likely to occur across parts of Mexico, which poses a significant flood risk.
"There is a possibility of up to 10 inches of rain from Baja California to Northwestern Sonora"
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical depression before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, and it will enter southern Utah via Arizona on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from the roost or its remains is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern deserts of the United States," according to the National Hurricane Center.
These rains can lead to deadly flash floods and destructive currents in the desert and cause landslides in the mountainous regions.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four men arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested in Somerset after a 16-year-old was found stabbed to death.
The boy was found injured in the area of Exelsea Terres in Norton, Midsummer, around 4pm on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he is now "stable."
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Redstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officers have appealed to those who may have mobile phone footage to come forward.
Trump has said that the Democratic Party's "cruelty, anger"
"A vote in favor of Judge Cavana is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Cavanna was "cruelty, anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of her nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and passionately, denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he had been subjected to sexual abuse at her hands decades ago at a young age.
Ford also testified in the hearing of his complaint.
The President said on Saturday that “the American people have seen the extraordinaryness and qualities and courage of Cavani on that day.”
He told West Virginia supporters that a vote for Jazz Cavanhar would be a vote to protect an attorney with the most successful legal right of our time, public service sterling record."
Speaking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president unequivocally acknowledged Cavani's nomination.
"It's only five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"Even though I'm not taking part, I'm really taking part," he said.
"That's why I'm always trying to fight for great candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Cavannah's nomination is not expected to take place on Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia's earthquake, the toll is on the rise.
At least 384 people have been killed and many have been swept away by the storm on the coast of Sulawesi, Indonesia, after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered for a festival in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18 ft) high wave broke out on the coast in the evening, driving many people to their deaths and destroying everything along the way.”
The tsunami came after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"Even when the threat of yesterday's tsunami hit, people continued their activities on the beach and those who could not run immediately and became victims of it," said Sutopo Puro, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, at a briefing in Nugroho Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come from itself, it pulled the car, the log, the house, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho added, adding that the tsunami traveled at speeds of 800 kilometers (497 miles) per hour in the open sea before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to survive the tsunami, and they survived.
Around 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palau.
Images from the sky, released by the disaster agency, showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges overturned and collapsed, and a mosque submerged in water.
Saturdays are also held in the coastal city.
The series of earthquakes was felt in areas with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the power released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the capacity of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, can further increase the size of the tsunami
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the dead bodies were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, he added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nogroho said the damage could be more severe in an area called Dongla, near the epicentre of the quake, 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of Palu.
"The communication system was "completely crippled without any information," Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers are heading to the affected areas."
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come as soon as the warning was issued.
On social media, a man on the top floor of the building was seen shouting to people on the street below and hearing the tsunami warning.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hit the stream bank and floated the buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the footage.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused power outages, which cut off communications around the Palau and made the authorities' rescue operations inconvenient.
The military has started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, adding that rescuers are now in great need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit Palau's shelters on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's terrible.
According to Mr. Dossebbar, when the World Organization's employees were on their way from Dongla to the city of Palu, where the employees were sheltering in the courtyard of their office, they saw images of destruction along the way.
"They've seen a lot of houses destroyed there," Dossaba said.
It's sad.
Even when aid teams went to start disaster relief operations, some complained that foreign aid workers were being barred from travelling to Palu with many skills.
According to Indonesian rules, funding from abroad, food supplies and staff will only come when a disaster has been declared a national disaster zone.
But it has not been announced yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Ariani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says yes, it's a national disaster, then we can start international aid, but we haven't made any announcement yet."
On the second night of Friday's tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing people are hoping for miraculous events that will light up their hopes of finding them at the end of a brutal chapter of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was picked up from the river.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been bitten by a stone for two days next to her mother's body.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Jendon Subando trained two paragliders at the Asian Games, who are now missing, which took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
Mr. Mendagi also mentioned that those who were trapped at the Row Row Hotel were his students.
He further said, “As a pioneer in the paragliding sector, I have a responsibility to my own emotions.”
Mr. Jendon recalls how the news of the rue rue hotel collapse spread to the paragliding community hours later, he backtracked and spread it to the Palu contestants via WhatsApp message, who participated in a festival on the beach.
However, his message was ignored instead of being read.
He said, "That means the message was not sent."
The thieves stole <0x24>26,750 while re-entering the ATM machine at Live's Newport.
A Newport Police Department press release said the thieves stole <0x24>26,750 on Friday morning while Brinks employees kept the money at the ATM.
The driver was emptying ATM money at the entertainment complex and was ready to pay more, Detective Dennis McCarthy said at a press conference.

According to the press release, witnesses have seen many suspects flee, but the police have not yet specified the number of people involved in the incident.
If anyone can identify these individuals, they are being asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-36880.
Kane West: The rapper has changed his name to Yes.
Rapper Kane West has changed his name to Yay.
Announcing the change, he wrote on Twitter on Saturday: "Formally known as Kane West."
West, 41, was also known as Ye for some time, and he used the name as his surname.
The name change was revealed before his appearance on T. Saturday Night Live, where he hoped to unveil his new album, Yandy.
The show's producer said he was replacing singer Ariana Grande at the event, who canceled the event for "anxiety reasons."
West had previously said that the term has religious significance to him, as well as a shortened form of his current professional name.
While discussing the title of the album with radio broadcaster Big Boy earlier in the year West said, “I believe ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’.”
We are you, we are you, we are you.
Cain is said to be the only person, reflecting that we are good, bad, our confusion, everything.
This album reflects more of our identity."
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their names.
Shawn Combs is known in various ways as Puff Daddy, PDD, or DD, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brothers Love.
A former West ally, J-G, O Haifen, has worked with Hyphen and the capital.
Mexico's AMLO has vowed not to impose military force on civilians.
Mexican President Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez has vowed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of bloody torture against students that he will not force military force against civilians.
Lopez Abramov on Saturday promised in Tolatelloco Plaza that “do not use military force for the oppression of the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on peaceful protests that killed 300 people while the left-wing student movement in Latin America was building its own stronghold.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Abrams has apologised to young Mexicans with monthly education allowances and support to build more public universities.
He said the lack of employment and education opportunities are attracting young people to crime.
The U.S. should double the amount of artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should also double the amount of research costs in this area, says artificial intelligence researcher and investor Kai-fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement comes from various parts of the government, announcing in the United States that there is a formal strategic deficit in artificial intelligence in the United States.
China has already launched its new plan last year: it aims to rank number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“Double budgets in artificial intelligence research will be a good new start where most countries are far behind in this regard and we are looking for the next step forward in advancing artificial intelligence.”
The double funding could double the chances of the U.S. achieving the next big artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "All Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month, has invested in Huton Mifflin Hercort, chief executive of Sinovation Venture, one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s, Carnegie worked on an artificial intelligence system at Mellon University that defeated the highest-ranked American player and fell into the hands of Microsoft Research's executive and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has acknowledged the technology competition of the previous U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, to determine the next step.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"China is not removing academic leaders; corporates are giving up," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired illustrators from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy could help boost U.S. AI efforts.
“I think the green card should be offered automatically to the PhD in artificial intelligence,” he said. SI’s AI efforts further increased.
China's State Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies as spending money on U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is low, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, which means engaging partners with industry and academics, and the White House announced the formation of an election committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DRPA announced an investment of <0x24>2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As an NSF, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law that seeks to set up the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen progress in months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would solve a decades-old conflict with Greece that blocked attempts to gain membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, represents a claim to its territory and vetoed the entry of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Giorz Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and doubted whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent needed to validate the referendum in the referendum.
The question in the referendum ballot was: “You are for NATO and EU members with the recognition of the agreement with Greece.”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, have argued for the price to be paid for admission to the European Union and NATO organization for Macedonia, one of the countries originating from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth in Macedonia so that they can live freely in the shadows of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us," Oliviera Georgzevska Skopje, 79, said in a statement.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will abide by the outcome of the vote by taking decisions.
A two-thirds majority is needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 pm.
However, compared to 34 per cent of the 2016 parliamentary elections, only 16 per cent voted, while 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I'm here to vote because of my children, we have a place in Europe," said Jos<0xC3><0xA9> Tenevsky, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zurika and his son Dushko voted to change the country's name for a referendum in Macedonia, which will open the way for NATO and the European Union to join the Stramica in Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje, pulling a chair in front of the tents that would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join our heads up, not through the door of service," Cavadrakov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia solidarity.”
Prime Minister Zayev said NATO membership will bring the required investment in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO," Zyev said after his ballot.
He said that a "yes" result would be our "confirmation of the future."
A survey published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia said 30 to 43 percent of voters would vote in the referendum below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by Telema TV in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of respondents who were found to be planning to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
More than 50 percent of the vote is required to be successful.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first fatal blow to the Western-backed government's policy since taking power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero enters the entire Brighton defense for the goal
Brighton defeated Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling by 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday.
Aguero made it easier to see his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in midfield at the start of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before going into the open field.
The fire was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He turned around a defender before crossing several others at the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he pushed a pass to the left, which found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to shoot on the right side of the net, defeating Brighton defender Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems on his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
Sterling, however, gave Sky Blues the primary advantage of the Premier League battle.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero found the ball deep within the Brighton area in the game.
He sent the ball to Liroy Sen by a beautiful way to the edge of the left.
Sen took a few touchdowns before taking Sterling to a distant post.
Sky blues forward taped the ball into the net just before crossing the border.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at 12:55pm on Tuesday in Ren-Necker-Arne, Germany.
Sherlock Holmes wants to play in the game.
There was not much reason for the Nationals to force another start after being removed from the playoffs controversy.
However, she hopes to take the round against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the play-offs have an impact on the one-game lead against the NL West's Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockys won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night to secure at least a wild card spot, but they still want to win their first division title.
"While we're not playing for anything, at least we can put foot on the rubber with Denver's viewers and the other team that's likely to play at the highest level of any points I've faced this year.
Why don't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but it is said that she could allow Sherzer to pitch in such a situation.
Sherzer, who will start his 34th time, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and pitched at his usual restaurant on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed 18-7, with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president sharply referred to his Supreme Court-elect Brett Cavannah's surrounding situation.
"Everything we've done is in danger in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"It's a big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running because I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back the energy by using any means necessary, you see this lowness, rudeness.
They don't care who they are attacking, who they have to be beaten up to get power and control, they just want power and control, we don't give them that."
He said the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and obstruct."
"And you have seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "rapid and downcast and rude and untrustworthy."
He has named Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which received high praise from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?"
Did you find the file?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, no, I wait - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a free organization.
Those who do not understand what is in their mind.
It was no surprise that the members of my party voted for me.
Because I was the last Labour MP on the list to tell you that the nature of the bowlers will not be welcomed here.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, had similar behavior because she firmly stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was found guilty of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on Europe and national security, and on similar issues, on which Jeremy did not even agree with the previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday said that “we want to make meetings inclusive and productive.”
In my eight years as a local Labour MP, for the first time Friday night's GC meeting was exactly the same.
But unfortunately, today, it is not the tone of that meeting and the promise of "friendly, gentle" politics has long been forgotten, if in fact it ever began.
It has become increasingly apparent that dissent in the Labour Party is not tolerated and that every opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable for the party leadership.
It began soon after Jeremy became leader, with colleagues I thought I had a similar political outlook, they began to expect me to take a U-turn and ask me to take a position that I would not agree with under any circumstances - be it national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly — and although what I say doesn’t matter — there are calls for me to be removed by abusing me on social media, condemning center politics, and telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than a few of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are also political.
I am surprised to see the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a storm of discrimination or racist abuse on a daily basis, but never feel ashamed.
The most disappointing aspect of this era of politics is how the inequalities have become normal
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should build a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a free organization and every "dissolution" narrows the party to a vote or change in the rules of the election.
For the past two years, many people have been advising me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and to say "I'm okay."
I'm not into politics to do that.
When I joined the Labour School as a student 32 years ago, we were provoked by the neglect of the government of Thecher that literally destroyed our broad school classrooms, I tried to provide necessary government services to those who needed the most — whether as local councillors or government ministers.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East is in any way confused about my policy position and the areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I can say for those who campaigned on Friday is that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm families, businesses, and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy by showing loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But it's not really a message to me for Nottingham Momentum, whether it's to my constituents, Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no stalemate threat or political activity will prevent me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP from Nottingham East.
38-17 Melrose: Rising to the top of the undefeated income
The two attempts late may reduce the gap between the final results a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayre deserved to win in this day's extraordinary recreational Tencent's Premiership match.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, it was their best defense, just as good as their ability to take advantage of them, which helped the host team win and the right reason to be happy with coach Peter Murchi.
"We've been tested in every game so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy."
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Ire has to give credit, they’ve exploited their prospects better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, converted by Frazier Clemo, forwards the Irons, however, is a yellow card from Scotland's player Rory Hughes, who expels him for the game by Warriors, gives Melrose a majority, and Jason Bagott makes a unsuccessful attempt.
Clemo scored in the penalty to increase the lead of the iron, just before, during halftime, he scored in a single attempt and turned it 17-5 at a break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's effort, converted by Bagot, reduced the gap by five points.
Then the game was stopped for a long time due to the serious injury of Ruiridh Nut, who became a stretcher and earned much more after the resumption of the game, through the efforts of Stafford McDowell, which he transformed into Clemo.
Ayer's acting captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and after a spell of severe pressure again, Melrose's Bruce Colvin tried to punish the additional player of Ayre.
Although the hosts return right, and when Straun Hutchinson sees a yellow card to deal with the climo without the ball, McFarson pulled out of the penalty line and forwarded the earnings to the mall.
Again converted Clemo, Kyle Roe when David Armstrong's box kick was bogged down and Flanker sent Gregor Henry out on the fifth attempt at the home side.
Steel Game Star Restaurant Ready for a New Career in the Industry
Steel game star Ford Kieran has said he is ready to enter the hospitality industry after being nominated as director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he himself wrote and co-starred with long-time comedian Greg Hemfield.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final series of the show and it looks like Kyernan is planning his own life after Craigslist.
According to the official records list, he is the director of Adriftmore Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although Scottish Sun sources indicated that Cairnan wanted to engage in Glasgow's "rich restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's land-locked court hopes to reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are patrolling a Rigged Clad Naval Headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying an ocean-blue flag.
The naval bases in the Amazon from Lake Titicaca are decorated by this motto: "The sea is our right"
It's a responsibility to restore it."
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coast is still clear – just as it is possible to travel once more to the Pacific Ocean, losing to Chile in a bloody 19th century conflict.
These expectations are probably the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice ruling on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has that momentum, unity and a sincere spirit, and of course we look forward to the results with a positive outlook," said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadila.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will go in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of appropriate negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign outlet to Bolivia at sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic tribal president - who will face a controversial fight for re-election next year - also relies a lot on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision for Bolivia - and even if it does, it will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN agency does not have the authority to give territory to Chile and has said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The ICJ's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments were heard, indicating that the case was "not complicated," Chilean international law expert Paz Jarett said.
In the last four years, it may have gone back to the past four years rather than moving forward the cause of Bolivia.
"The entry of the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," said Jeterte.
Morales' anti-war speech has raised any extrajudicial greetings from Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk up to a point, but it will be very difficult to discuss later.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The Bolivian representative to The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Vaultzi, has rejected the court's decision to be unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring an opportunity to "an extraordinary opportunity for a new era in relations with Chile" and "to end 139 years of conflict with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadila also denies that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political pole.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to enter the Pacific," he added.
"It's an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament will not come until the United States believes in it.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would not disarm nuclear weapons first if it did not trust Washington.
He made the remarks at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to abide by the commitments the rival leaders made during a summit in Singapore.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on track with North Korea's Kim Jong Un to resume unhindered nuclear diplomacy in Singapore after more than three months.
Rei said it was a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and the U.S.'s objection to the declaration of an end to the Korean War would jeopardize North Korea.
Washington has warned that Pyongyang may agree to the declaration without a significant disarmament process in the first place.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump both want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal, which the country is probably looking at as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveals the Last Line of Huge Headwear on a High Street Road Near You
If you want to increase the collection of your hat or block the sun completely, there is no need to watch anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brown unveiled a series of oversized head gears for their SS19 collection on the runway that shocked the style set in the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, a very unusual hat has been leaked on Instagram and the designers have sent their eye-catching creation to Katwa.
One of Valentino's creations was an over-the-top badge hat equipped with a feather-like wide-brimmed rod that covered the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories include decorative melons, a wizard's hat, even an pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown has also published a selection of bizarre masks - and at exactly the right time for Halloween.
The lips of many colored masks were similar to that of Hannibal Lakers compared to sewing and awesome fun.
One creation resembles the whole scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, the other looks like any melted ice cream.
And if you continue to make a huge fashion statement - you're lucky.
Style observers have predicted that the huge bonnets can go to the high street near you.
Outsized hats are competing with La Bomba, a two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat that everyone is seen wearing from Riyana to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely absurd hat that has spread across social media has sent another massive creation to Katwa - a straw beech bag that is almost as big as a swimwear model.
The orange raffia bag burned at La Rivera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week was one of them, with the raffia frying and a white leather handle at the top.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told Fimail: "I hope that next summer big hats and beach bags will arrive on High Street - as the designer has made such a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edwards: Linguistic skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence, and it continues to produce another outstanding test result in 2018, which is only reinforced by personal and collective success in sports, art, music, and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for more and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as world citizens.
As an educational field that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we see modern language continues to be a popular and preferred subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent test results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rate among independent schools.
A total of 68% of foreign language study students have achieved higher grades.
Data collected from a school of 74 members of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students achieved higher grades in Mandarin, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language now, as the subject choice, is being held in the same way as individual school curriculum and elsewhere in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of employers blamed a lack of language skills for the reasons they struggled to fill the vacancies.
So more and more, language skills are becoming essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
These skills are needed in the world of globalization for more potential job opportunities.
Any career choice Nick, if they learn a second language, will have their real advantage with their lifetime skills in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from abroad automatically puts a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a 2013 UK survey of more than 4,000 adults, 75 percent of the conversation was not able to speak a foreign language well, and French was the only language in the decade-long majority, 15 percent.
This is why it is important for today's children to invest in language education.
Having multiple languages, especially the language of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school will be different in the languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be many languages to choose from in individual schools, including specialist learning staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an education environment that will prepare children and create them with the skills they need to succeed no matter what the future holds.
In the global business environment it cannot be denied at the moment that languages play an important role in the country's future, so it must be reflected in the field of education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will provide this choice, diversity and enthusiasm for the young people of Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make his debut at Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans are almost finished waiting to see LeBron James' first trip to Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's preseason opener against Denver Nguets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James would probably play a limited-minute game.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six-player preseason schedule.
"I don't need a preseason game to get ready at this stage of my career," he said.
During Trump's West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump stormed a campaign rally in Welling, West Virginia, tonight.
This is the first of five scheduled rallies in the next week of Trump, including stops in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote for confirmation of his election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy remains at a pause, Trump is aiming to build support for the next mid-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after voting in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to make a speech this week on the Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavannah's hearing, which has sparked allegations of sexual abuse with an anticipated Senate confirmation vote during the FBI investigation.
But the primary goal of the opening of these rallies is to help Republicans gain some momentum in the face of the November election.
In this way, President Trump's campaign says that the purpose of these five rallies next week is to "emphasize volunteers and supporters, as Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority under the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress control is so important for its agenda that as we enter the busy campaign season, the president will travel to the states as much as possible," a Trump campaign spokesman said.
Set for Wesbenko Arena in Whiling, today's rally "can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and bring coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
This is the second time since last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40% of the points.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a very good sign for Mauritius that the president has to try to encourage him further in the election," said Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA look forward to fighting to save hope in a singles draw on Sunday
At the end of the three one-off sessions, the rider's cup was needed on Saturday afternoon.
The pendulum swing of Momentum is a completely invented sports concept but in it the players really believe, and most of all, in such a competition.
Where do they say they're moaning now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a little momentum now," Jordan told Spieth to walk for the day.
Europe has advantages, of course, with 12 more games remaining, leading by four points.
As Spieth said, Americans think they have some help along the way and they can be encouraged by a lot of things, especially the form of Spith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and both of them took four to three points.
Spieth was fatal from the beginning to the end and is leading from the front.
As he ran his round, the loud cries of celebration were getting even more intense, when he and Thomas were still back on two points after scoring two points, making important moves to shake the four-point full-square match.
The beat he won in the 15th match got a similar shout, which tells you a lot that he believes the American team is not out of it.
"You really have to go deep and think about your own game," Spieth said.
That's what all of these players have now.
There are 18 marks.
The players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are just the fairies of Francisco Molinary and Tommy Fleetwood, Rider's Cup.
The strange but adorable pair of four to four and can't make any mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only pair that didn't shoot any bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning on the back nine.
That run, and the way their power was flowing from and to this enthusiastic crowd, seemed like they were the defeated players on Sunday, and there was no other potential popular player like to seal European victory without Fleetwood or Malinari as the sun sets in Le Golf National.
It's best to have both at the same time.
European pride, however, remains unresolved.
While pairing up with Alex Norne, Boba Watson and Web Simpson made some problems for Sergio Garcia.
In the first nine, a bogie and two doubles Spaniards and a Swede were thrown into a hole from which they could never get up.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to get you out of your hole.
The mutual interaction between the pair bindings, which they suggest, is very interesting to see from close to the foreball and forearms because of the advice that they do not give, and the strategy that can change instantly.
Europe has played relatively well as a team so far and took an important lead on the final day, but this foursome session has further proved that Team USA is hungry for a fight that some, especially the Statesside suspected.
Europe lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will take a healthy lead of 10-6 against the United States from Saturday's Forbal and Foursome matches.
The excited duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinary have now taken their tally to four points in the golf nationals, leading twice against the duo of Tiger Woods.
The European team of Thomas Jorne, bid to recover the lost trophy in Hazeltin two years ago, won the series 3-1 by blowing up a flawless American side in the morning foreballs.
The United States offered more resistance to Forsom by winning two matches, but they could not meet the deficit.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to recover the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a draw and he and Molinary, together with "Mollywood," are only the second pair to score four points from the first four matches in Rider Cup history after an extraordinary weekend.
They then beat Woods and Patrick Reid to the foreball, and went on to beat a losing Woods and American Ricky Brayson Decambeu by 5 and 4 more vigorously.
Woods, who pulled himself out in two games on Saturday, occasionally stormed the spotlight, but now he lost 19 matches and seven draws in 29 of his Forbal and Forsam.
Justin Rose, taking a rest for the morning for Foreball, returned to partner Henrik Stansson in Forsom, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepker 2 and 1 - number one in the world.
A pleasant, windy day on the south-west side of Paris, although it was not on its own in Europe.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 against Spain's Zone Ram and Yan Poulter at Forbale and returned to defeating both Holler and Rory McLurray in 4 and 3.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has returned from a four-point deficit in the singles, although as of now, only a draw is needed to recover the side's trophy.
After being the second best for two days, however, Sunday's counterattack looks like it will surpass them.
North Korea has said it will not unilaterally disarm "without faith."
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the current sanctions are deepening its distrust of the United States and that the country has no chance of unilaterally abandoning its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Organization's annual general session that North Korea had taken "significant greeting measures" such as ending nuclear and missile tests last year, breaking down the nuclear laboratory, and promising not to increase nuclear technology and the spread of nuclear weapons.
"But we have not seen any similar reaction in the United States," he said
"We will have no confidence in our national security even if there is no trust in the United States and in such a situation there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves."
While Ri described North Korea’s allegations against Washington’s “strategic” approach to nuclear disarmament that North Korea would be rewarded for its slow action, his statement appeared to be significant because it did not unilaterally exclude nuclear disarmament, since Pyongyang has done so in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" and when Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also called on North Korea to ease tough international sanctions.
"The United States has stressed the "disarmament-first" and has increased the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose with obligation, even against the declaration of the end of the "war"," Rei said.
"The idea that bans can put us on the ground is an obscene dream of those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our distrust."
Ri Kim and Trump did not comment on the plans for a second summit that the U.S. head of state highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
The minister, instead of referring to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, said: “If the issue of disarmament had been South Korea without the United States, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been so stale.”
Still, the tune of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the American mainland with North Korea's rockets when "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a suicide "rocket man."
At the United Nations this year, Trump threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praising Kim for his courage to take steps to destabilize, but said there was still a lot of work to do and sanctions must continue until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years, or five months to do it - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the actions taken by the UN Security Council
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Americans on Thursday that: “The Security Council sanctions must continue effectively until we fully realize fully verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to halt funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rey at the United Nations General Assembly in Brussels and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not good.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said there had been some progress, only a few hours before North Korea condemned him for "demanding like a gangster!"
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States "takes similar measures."
He said the "related actions" Kim was looking for were the security guarantee Trump had given in Singapore and the security guarantee he had made to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking the course to get enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is rolling out ways for all her graduates to get more sleep to cope with the growing culture of studying at night of caffeine-burning “Rajaga”.
An academic has discovered that students at the number one university in the world are often confused about very basics about how they will take care of themselves.
The course was developed by Charles Seychelles, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, which he believes will be the first in the United States.
After giving a speech about the impact of lack of sleep on education, he was inspired to start the course.
“At the end of this, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why have I been told this so long, my senior year has come?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she said to the Telegraph.
This course, which was launched for the first time this year, explains how the best sleep habits help students in academic and athletic performance as well as the need to improve their general well-being.
Paul Bareira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's Department of Health, said the university decided to launch the course this week after students were severely deprived of sleep.
An hour-long course consists of some post-related tasks.
A section contains images of a dorm room, where students will learn about the effects of caffeine and light by clicking on coffee cups, screens, trainers, and books, and learn how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and realize the importance of a bedtime routine.
In other sections, participants are asked how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students immediately."
But we believe that they have the right to know - as much as you decide to smoke, but also have the right to know its effects on health."
He said the culture of “staying up all night” still exists, adding that sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to the increasing pressure on modern technology and students.
You should have a student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety to ensure adequate good quality sleep, he said - even sleep deprivation makes the brain starve, making them constantly hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old studying chemical and physical biology in California, helped Professor Sisler design the course, also taking a class during his first year at Harvard last year.
He said that this course opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes that all postgraduate students will be requested to complete such a study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Sizzler recommended that students should consider setting up an alarm for when to go to bed as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can destroy your circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's Golmaal defeats Gerard's Sheeps.
The Rangers suffered a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerard's random team Livingston in Dolly Manger's goal.
After a 4-1 win at St Johnston in February, the Ibrox team looked at another win, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerard's second defeat as manager in 18 matches, which led him eight points away from the hearts at the top of Ledbroke's Premiership.
Menga was injured seven minutes before half-time, but the expected Rangers line-up never gave them a tick.
Rangers have now moved down to sixth place, Livingston has moved to third place and has surpassed Hibernian in goal difference.
And there may be more problems for rangers because Linesman Callum Spence had to be treated for a head injury for an object thrown from the Away edge.
Gerard has made eight changes in the team that have made the Iron Man to the top of the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livy 11 that took a point off the hearts last week and was proud of the way his well-equipped team beat the opponent to breathe.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston has done more with the ball.
Mengor should have scored in just two minutes if Scott Pittman was sent to Le-off Alan McGregor for the first time, but the midfielder wasted his big chance.
A long free-kick captain from Kighan Jacobs found Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was able to hit the ball in the back post.
The Rangers regained control, but were more hopeful than confident of their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morales, of course, felt that he should have received a penalty in the quarter-hours due to a clash between him and Steven Lolles, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed Colombia's request.
Rangers could only target two shots on the first half, but were barely bothered by the head shots of former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly Lasana Colibaly and OV Azariah.
Livi's 34th minute opening goal may have been against the currents of the game, but no one can deny that they are the only ones to have played this designer.
Again, the Rangers failed to handle Jacobs' dip set-piece.
Scott Arfield didn't react to Deccan Gallagher's ball slotting Scott Robinson, he kept his head cold to pick Menga for general finishing.
Gerard took action at the break with Ryan Kent to replace Kulibali, and the change was almost immediately going to work since the winger was in Morls, but extraordinary Kelly moved him from the line to the block.
But while Livingston visitors began to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, Lithgow and Halke were sending long balls after a long ball.
Holt's team could have taken their lead to the final stage, but McGregor stood up to ruin Jacob's efforts before heading off the Lithgow corner.
With Jacobs sneezing, Thomson again turned his back on the demand for Glenn Middleton, the subsidiaries of the late penalties.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter.
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... the day in the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually became known as a device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, a core of science, Geiger Counter also became the basis of a pop culture, in the 1950 film "Balls of Coronado," starring seemingly prolific cowpok scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It is used to detect radioactive minerals such as a gauger counter, uranium.
When you convey these earphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms given by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Does that sound like a lot?"
Hans Gigger died in 1945 just days before his 63rd birthday.
However, his discovery is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells as part of the treatment
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
Then they can "see" a common protein for many cancers and then be re-infected.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results with patients with different levels of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect fungal cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the common proteins of many cancers, called HER2, and then re-entrying the cells.
J Barzoffsky, a professor at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "Increases the growth of a variety of cancers, including breast, ovaries, lungs, and colorectal cancers," explained Professor Barzofsky.
A similar approach has also worked to treat leukemia to "learn" them out of disease-resistant cells outside of patients and "how to target cancer cells."
Kanye West joins pro-Trump controversy at SNL wearing a MAGA hat
It didn't go well
Kanye West was booed at the studio after a long performance during Saturday Night Live where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would continue to be self-made in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great Cap, he denounced the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Sometimes when I talk to a white person, they say: "How can you like Trump, he's racist!"
"Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have been out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a skit starring Matt Damon where Hollywood star Kristin Blazi joked about the testimony of Brett Cavanna at the Senate's Judicial Committee over the allegations of sexual assault by Ford.
Although it hasn't been aired, West's funny footage has been uploaded by actor Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear if West tried to make a joke with the Rock Post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had to face backstage problems with his head covering as well.
"They threw me in the backseat.
They said, "Don't go out wearing a hat."
They've hit me!
And then they said I'm in a sinking place," according to the Washington Examiner's source.
West adds: “Do you want to see the place?” This says that he will read his own “superman cape, because it means you can’t tell me what to do. “Do you want to see the world move forward?
Try it with love."
His comments were booed at least twice from the audience and SNL cast members were embarrassed, Variety reported, where one person told the publication: "There was a pindown silence throughout the studio."
West was brought in as an alternative to singer Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West I Love Its Performance By Decorating Like a Pierre Bottle Confused Many
West Conservative Group received support from TPUSA chief Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up against the evil doers.”
But talkshow presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was what it was and he's absolutely great."
"But I chose not to reward someone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who is embracing and spreading harmful ideals for my community."
He is FREE.
"And so are we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he is now "officially known as Kanye West."
D is not the first artist to change his name and follows his path to DD, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P.D.D.
Another contemporary rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Leon and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol that was previously known as Prince.

Police said the incident took place in Bali.
Assange is scheduled to appear in the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacked toxic masculinity or toxic masculinity.
Kit Harrington is known for his combative role as Zone Snow in HBO's attacking medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke about the protagonist's stereotype, saying that playing such a role on the screen meant giving young boys the idea that they have to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt said he believed "something went wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at the age of 31, admitted that she felt strongly about the problem.
"I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment - where are we going wrong in masculinity?" he said.
"What did we teach them when men were growing up, that we are now facing this problem?"
Kite believes that television toxic masculinity may be partly responsible for the increase in its ultra-male characters.
He said: "What are we learning?
What is taught on TV and on the street that boys feel that they have to follow this particular path to be men?
I think that's one of the biggest questions of this time - how do we change that?
"It's obviously a big mistake for the young people."""
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones practical or sequels when the series will be renewed next summer, saying that he had finished the life of 'war fields and horses'.
From November, Kitt will star in the remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his estranged brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considered his wife Rose the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so it's the gift that my future family has given to my life."
In the Rose Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Igrit played the character of John Snowe's lover.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported 14% growth in new cases.
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of HIV and AIDS cases.
There are more than 820,000 confirmed cases in the country, health officials said.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases were caused by sexual transmission, which changed from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection spread rapidly to different parts of China for blood circulation.
But the number of people infected with HIV has been brought down to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still considered to be prevalent.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men have sex with men, they later marry women.
Many diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has committed to universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to tackle this problem.
Maxin Waters denies leaking information to GOP senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of his staff posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia page of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat firmly claimed that these claims were being promoted by "ultra-right wing" scholars and websites.
"False, false, and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released includes the address and phone number of U.S. Senators, Lindsay Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both YouTubers.
The information was published online on Thursday, an unidentified person posted on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavana.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Cavannah.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Scholars and Redstat reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with the "Waters" office and disclosed information of any member of the Waters staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is a complete lie and a perfect lie," Waters continued.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these frauds and false accusations - were not responsible for the leak of this information in any way.
This baseless allegation is completely false and a complete lie."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism from many online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fitzgerald.
"This disapproval is outraged," Fitzgerald wrote.
"It shows that he has no inclination to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they will not be angry.
They certainly will not be a contender.
They must not question the purpose of the complainant.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fisher was comparing Waters' response to criticism from Democrats about Judge Cavanaugh, when critics saw him as very angry during a hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for re-election to remove Waters in the midterm elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's really big," he said.
In his statement, Waters said his office had "warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims."
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are released,” he continued, “and that any member of my staff and all members of my staff will be legally held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous.”
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Weak Rowan Atkinson Spying
It is now traditional to see the significance of Brexit in any new film, including British trilogy, and it seems to be applicable to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy Spoof franchise - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to life in 2011.
Is it clear how much of a waste nation we are going to become a self-exporting opportunity?
At any rate, pop-visited, rubber-oriented disabled Johnny English has a license to create new things for the second time - more than anything else his name indicates that he created a wider comic, designed for the language cinema world other than English.
He is certainly a fool's secret representative who, despite the bizarre trend of smooth glamor, contributed a doll of Mr. Bin and a note to the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in London, Charlottes of Fire Theme Town.
He is based primarily on the trailer and starred in the once-forgotten Barclayed TV ads of the people of international mystery Atkinson, spreading chaos in the know.
This last <0x58>i outing has one or two great moments.
I like to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter while the rotor blades hanging with a little helmet in the dress of medieval armor.
Atkinson's gift for physical humor is being shown, but the humor is quite low and oddly exaggerated, especially with the "Syrias" film brand like 007 and Mission Impossible now offering humor as an element of confidence.
The joke seems like it's intended for kids rather than adults, and to me, Johnny English's bizarre accidents aren't as innovative and centered as Ben's silent-senior joke on Atkinson's personality.
Over the years, Britain has been facing a serious problem.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's highly confidential web network of espionage, to reveal the identity of all UK agents in the field, to frustrate the responsible agent - sadly a small role for Kevin Alden.
This is the last confidence of a prime minister who is already suffering from a complete downturn in politics, he is a bleak and bound personality: Emma Thompson has done her best with this semi-teresa-may character, but there's not much to do with the script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every active spy had been compromised, so he had to get someone out of retirement.
And that means speaking to Johnny English, who is now employed as a school teacher in some posh institutions, but teaches beyond the record about how to be a disguised worker: here are some good jokes, since English offers the Rock-type Academy of Intelligence here.
He returned to the English Whitehall for emergency briefings and reunited with his former long-endowed sidekick Baue, starring Ben Miller.
Bowe is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, the role of a watery-hooky-stick in which Vicky Pepperdine has been somewhat discarded.
Thus, the batsman and Robin, who made a serious mistake in the Her Majesty's Secret Service, returned to action and faced Olga Kurenko's bisexual woman, Ophelia Boulevard.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling into the hands of billionaires with caricatures, who claim to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: Jason Volta, a pawn in the role of Jack Lacey.
English and Baue began strange sounds of their far-flung high-gender: they caught fire in a flash French restaurant in the disguise of Waiter; they began to fight themselves by pressing on a Voltar luxury boat; and the English Voltaire tried to introduce himself to the interior of the house using the virtual reality headset.
All the stops have certainly been drawn for the last sequence, but as much as it's messy and uplifting, there's quite a bit of kids' TV thinking about the whole thing.
A very average staff.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn’t have imagined: the British film industry can’t give Roan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
Labour denies that it is planning to work four days a week for Britain but will receive a salary for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a key plan that will see Britons work four days a week - but get paid for five days.
According to the report, the company's owners want to share the money saved by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution with an extra day holiday.
It will see employees enjoying a three-day holiday - but will still raise the same salary at home.
According to sources, the idea will be "fit" for the party's economic programme and there is a plan to move the country for workers.
Trade Union Congress has approved the transfer of workers to a four-day week as a way to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight but the four-day workday is an aspiration that fits with the team's approach to balance the economy in favour of the worker as well as the overall industrialization of the party."
Not the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working day during their 2017 general election campaign.
The desire is not currently being supported by the Labour Party as a whole, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working day is not a party policy and it is not being considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to express his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return power to utility companies from 'unknown directors' and 'lovers'.
Shadow Chancellor's plan means that current shareholders of water companies may not get their entire share back because the Labour government may give some "bad" due to the wrong thing to be perceived.
He also confirmed plans to keep employees on the company board and create an inclusive ownership fund to ensure fairness to 10% of employees of private-sector companies whose annual dividends stand at <0x24>500.
Tell Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy "60 Minutes" to see if Kawana's FBI investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kaavana delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the Bureau's findings could turn a Republican senator over to their support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could discover something that led them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I asked to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kawana.
After this incident, I called him, the complaint came out, and I said, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, unconvinced."
Graham's vote, of course, appears to be irreversible.
"My mind has been made up about Bret Kawana and a hugely important complaint will require it to be changed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denies it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
"And the name he said could not be verified.
It is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual music event that has a great line-up of stars' performances and an equally impressive mission; the end of world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will not only see thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is an extension of the global poverty project, a group that seeks to eradicate poverty by actively raising the number of people fighting internationally.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers had to do a variety of tasks or volunteer work such as "encouragement," emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has it been to have 12 years left to achieve its goal?
The idea of rewarding people through a free concert is a real move to encourage people to take action, or another case of so-called "clickivism" - where people think they're making a real difference by signing an application online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, moving towards achieving various goals.
It says the move has helped world leaders announce a <0x24>37 billion equivalent of commitments and policies that will affect the lives of 2.2 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the team cited 390 commitments and announcements that began with its operations, of which at least <0x24>10 billion has already been distributed or raised.
The team estimates that the secured fund has had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include the partnership of Power of Nutrition, UK-based investors and implementers "to help children grow their full potential", with Global Citizen receiving more than 4,700 tweets promising to provide Rwanda with 35 million to end malnutrition in the county.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote to history," Tracy Woolman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the public during a power concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 steps were taken in the U.S. to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in nutrition interventions.
One of the most frequently asked questions on its website was "What do you see that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail."
However, just like the great civil rights and the anti-racism movement before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Gene Mony will be one of those performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Fernnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use the Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington may "require" its navy to prevent Russian fuels from coming to the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan <0x58>inck said in a statement.
<0x58>inq alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - was an excuse to visit the new fuel market.
"I believe that their position in the Middle East is because they want to generate electricity like the southern hub of Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to take action against it.
"The United States has the power to keep sea routes free and, if necessary, block their fuels to ensure they don't go into the market," he said.
Jinck was speaking to the participants at an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that identifies "volunteer customers voice" in the United States.
He was comparing Washington's use of them to Russia and Iran, referring to the same in the real field.
"Putting Russia in the ashes, including a fossil-fuel-dependent economy," he said, referring to "the benefits and replacements of Iran and Russia's financial options from less fuel."
The Trump administration made these statements when it came to strengthening the export of liquefied natural gas to European consumers in Europe rather than Russia.
Under its influence, US President Donald Trump, including a Trump administration official, is trying to repeatedly bring Germany out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, is captured in the hands of Berlin Moscow."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the existing pipeline's capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is ready to be taken to the financial savings project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is nothing but financial and is an example of an unequal competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that fuel pressure cannot be used as a tool and should have the ability to choose a supplier for customers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after an interview with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has led to a negative response from Germany, with Germany reaffirming its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industry body, has asked the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and a bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) Dieter Kamf said, "We have a big problem with the intervention of a third state in our energy supply."
Elizabeth Warren will "find out" for the 2020 presidential nomination, said Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "find out" her candidacy for the presidency after an interim election.
Warren at a town hall in the Hollyok of Massachusetts confirmed that he was in the competition.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes women's inclusion in the top positions," she said.
"After November 6, I will be stepping down strongly in the presidential race."
During the course of the Warren Town Hall, President Donald Trump expressed his views on Trump, saying that Trump was "leaving the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been critical of Trump and Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need a FBI investigation before we vote."
According to a survey published on Thursday, most of Warren's own voters don't think he should contest his election in 2020.
According to a Boston Globe study at the University of Suffolk, 85 percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters say they shouldn't fight in a senator's vote.
Thirty-two percent voted in favor of the measure.
The study found that former governor Deval Patrick's support for the fight was higher, with 38 percent supporting the possible fight and 48% not.
Other high-profile Democrats likely to contest the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press said Biden would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested on Monday night for domestic violence.
"I understand other families who understand the consequences of what PTSD and our soldiers are going through," he told the audience at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an "elves at home" and told his son and other war veterans that "they changed a little bit, they came back strong, they came back to think about whether the military and the air force and other members of the military had any respect for the colleagues they had given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasil, Alaska, and according to Dan Bennett, a police department spokesman, he was accused of domestic violence, carrying weapons, and being drugged.
18 States, D.C. Supports New Refugee Policy Challenges
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting legal challenges against the new U.S. policy that refuses to provide shelter to victims fleeing gang or family violence.
To support a asylum seeker challenging the policy, representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief in court in Washington on Friday, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace V Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, was not disclosed.
He said his "and his violent gang member boys" abused him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The attorneys of Grace's supporting states give examples of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, as a country facing widespread gang and family violence problems, from where a large number of applicants came to the U.S. for asylum.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing for family violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Carl Resin of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "has ignored state, federal and international law for many decades."
The Friend-of-the-Court brief states that “the application of all refugees under this federal law should be judged according to specific information and circumstances, and such a ban violates the original purpose.”
In the statement, the attorneys also argued that the policy denying immigrants access is hurting the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and they "provide the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer shelter the victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Refugee can be granted to those who have been forced to leave their country due to persecution or fear for membership or political views in a nation, religion, nationality, or certain social groups," Sessions said in its announcement of its policy on June 11.
To say refuge is never meant to solve all problems - even all the deadly problems - that people face every day around the world.
The death toll has doubled in rescue efforts and the death toll in Palu
The situation for the survivors was alarming.
"Risa Kusuma, 35, at the Palu City Refugee Center, told her to comfort her feverish baby," it was very worrying.
"Every minute the ambulance arrives.
Clean water is not available."
Residents have been found to have returned to their destroyed homes in an attempt to find what was found in the water.
Hundreds of people were injured and a magnitude 7.5 quake hit hospitals.
Some injured people, including Duy Harris, who had broken his back and shoulder bones, have been kept outside the Palu Army Hospital, undergoing treatment under the sky due to a strong subsequent tremors.
He cried while he was in a five-storey hotel room with his wife and daughter to talk about the feeling of a terrible earthquake shaking.
"I didn't have time to save them.
"I was stuck in the middle of the broken wall, I think," Harris told a media representative, adding that they had come to town for a wedding ceremony.
"I can hear my wife's scream for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or her children.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "misleading" by means of "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. daily citing the mutual benefits of the U.S.-China trade, China's U.S. ambassador accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to launch a targeted campaign.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of Iowa's largest Chinese daily Des Moines Register and accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Congress election, China denies the allegation.
Trump alleged that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election, which U.S. officials told Reuters was a new attempt by Washington to pressure China.
It is normal that foreign governments will advertise to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war that has led to increased tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hurt exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party.
The U.S. ambassador to China and Iowa former long-time governor Terry Branstad, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had caused damage to American workers, farmers and traders.
Branstad said in an article on Sunday's Des Mines Register that China "has now doubled that barbarism with purposeful advertising in our own free press."
"The Chinese government is taking unethical advantage of the American freedom of speech and the history of the free press in this propaganda campaign by advertising payments to the Des Mines Register," Bransted wrote.
"On the other hand, at Newsstand on the side of the road in Beijing, you will find limited opposition voices and you will not see the true reflection of the Chinese people's disagreements about China's worrying economic path, because the news media is here at the behest of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that his writings "rejected to print a major newspaper in China," although he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans Want to Keep Women Voters Away Before Midterms in Cavanaugh Debate, Analysts Warn
In the face of multiple allegations of top Republican sexual harassment, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has stood by and analysts have warned that they will see adverse reactions from women, especially in the upcoming midterm elections.
The mood around the issue has finally grown, and most Republicans seem to have already expressed a desire to go ahead with the vote in public.
In an article published on Saturday, Grant Rihar, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill, "These cannot be returned in any way."
Rihar said there was little doubt whether the last-minute pressure on Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would calm the angry voters.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday," said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser to the progressive movement group and national women's spokesman, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
Protesters on Friday morning chanted "November is coming!" during a protest at the Senate's Hallway when Republicans who control the judicial committee over Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
"Legislative political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site, "Democratism will be the past as a source of encouragement and inspiration."
"People say there's too much; it's true.
But that may be even more, especially among the suburban dubbed female voters and among young voters aged 18 to 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even prior to Ford's public testimony on allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that if Republicans proceed with approval, it could lead to a vice-versa.
"It has become a complex issue for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about whether it's the committee's vote or the final vote or the Kafunoff, it's about how Republicans have taken up the matter and how they've used it," the director of the Proportions USA Group, who supports Democrats in the vote, Guy Seychelles, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be a bit skeptical about who to trust in the testimony of Fords and Kavanaugh, with views heavy on the next one.
A new Yugov study found that 41 percent of respondents believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh.
38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was lying at the time of taking his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flack's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and Deborah Ramirez, a minor, and another complainant, according to the Guardian.
Ford was sworn in last week to testify before the judicial committee that Kavanaugh had harassed him at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court had shown him his genitals at a party while studying in Yelena in the 1980s.
In order to compete with Google and Facebook, the inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
This technology is the latest project in the legend, Inrapt, a company that will create the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid users have the right to choose where their data will be stored and what information people will have access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrapt's real purpose was "world domination."
"We have to do this now," he said of the start-up.
"This is a historic moment."
This app allows everyone to create a POD or "private online data store" using Solid's technology.
These can include a contact list, two-do list, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in the same browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data store is that it will completely depend on the user - who can access the information in any form.
The company called it “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, Inrapt's ideas will help bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to get everyone's solids.
The company currently consists of a security platform bought by Burners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some contracted on-staff developers and a team of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using existing tools on Inrapt's website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are "not talking about whether to launch a complete change with Facebook and Google where all of their business models will be completely changed overnight."
"We don't want permission from them."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrapt's "purpose is to provide commercial fuel and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solids."
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has emerged as a strong voice in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I'm optimistic about the future of the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Victoria Cross Cleric Celebration of the First Bias War
Adi celebrates the centenary of the Church of England's only pastor who won the Victoria Cross during World War I as a warrior.
Lt. Col. The Rev. Bernard van won the award at the time of the invasion of Belgrade and Lehancott on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by an attacker four days later and he never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren unveiled the memorial at a parade in Russia's northwestern city of Rusden.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was "extraordinary" that the monument would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's death.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. van "had led his battalion through thick fog and fierce shells of field and machine gun" during the de Saint-Quantian Canal Paroner.
He then ran to the firing line and led the line with "maximum courage" and accompanied a field song and stabbed three enemies.
On October 4, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German attacker, just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather’s works were “something I could never have done and which was a great respect.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van Kuchkawz, then handed over the floral work, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was "extremely honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "a true hero's heroism is being displayed in support of a lot of people."
MMA fans woke up all night to watch 206 belotto, but they found Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine that you woke up all night to see a great bellator 206 and the main event was not shown.
The bill's original card from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six, and was shown live all night on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Moosasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the coverage changed to Peppa Pig and shocked the UK audience.
They were up early in the morning for this fight, so some people were angry.
A fan on Twitter described the conversion of children's cartoons as "a kind of dirty joke."
"They were forced to change the cartoons of children as it was not appropriate to show such events at 6 a.m. according to government rules," said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of Belato.
"Papa the Pig," Yes
Belato's president Scott Coker said he would work on creating a schedule for future UK audiences.
"Maybe we'll be able to solve it in the future," Cocker said.
"But now there's six on Sunday morning and our Sunday, they can't do it until Monday."
But we are working on it.
Trust me, when it's switched, there's a lot of messages coming in afterwards and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical error.
No, it was a government thing.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce it to five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- the opposite happened when we tried to give fans more.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Deli suffers from "indignity" due to sex.
Olympic diver Tom Delie says he suffered from low self-esteem when he was growing up - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking at the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Lavern, she said she talked about gay rights in giving others "hope."
He also said that after the birth of the child, his thoughts on winning the Olympics have decreased.
Christy Young, a regular host of this long-standing event, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a social democrat at Lavern's first event, Deli said she felt "smaller" than everyone else, because "the choice of boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said: “To this day, it remains real to feel that small and to feel different which has given me the strength and determination to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove himself as "something" so that everyone would know about his sexuality so that everyone wouldn't be disappointed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become an LGBT campaigner and has used his presence in Australia to appeal to more countries to recognize homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games.
He said he opened his mouth because he thought he was lucky to live in public without complications and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion talks about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - which surprised me.
Deli married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than her. She said age gap was not a problem.
"When you're faced with so much at such a young age, he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later," he said, adding that it was hard to find someone who had seen so many climbers in his life.
The couple gave birth to a son named Robert Ray Black-Deli in June and Deli said her "full perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would say 'I have to win a gold medal'.
"To be honest, there's more to the Olympics than the gold medal.
"Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Deli said her father never admitted that he was going to die and she eventually asked if their tickets for London 2012 were confirmed - because she wanted to be in the first row.
“I never even said ‘You’re not going to be in the first row anymore’,” he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and until he breathed his last and died, and I did not admit that he was invincible," she said.
The following year, Deli participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"It's been my dream all my life - to dive into the Olympics in front of my audience, there's nothing better than that," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - the Pride of Heather Small - which followed him in preparation for the Olympics and which still haunts him.

Michaelson to sit on the bench at the off-form on Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record in his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but if he doesn't want to do it, he will have to return his form.
Michaelson, who has played at this biennial event a record 12 times, had to sit on the bench on Saturday's Forbal and Foursome instead of Captain Jim Furick.
Instead of being at the center of the hull, which he played in the United States, this five-time Major-Winner spent his day working as a cheerleader and working hard to improve his game in the range.
Being not always comfortable with drivers even at the top of his career, this 48-year-old Tight Le Golf is not suitable for the National Course, where long rafs often cause trouble with long shots.
And if the course itself isn't bad enough, Michaelson, in the 9th match, is facing British Open champion Francesco Molinary, who has won all four of their matches this week, pairing up with Ruki Tommy Fleetwood.
If Americans, who are down four points at the start of the 12 singles match, can start well, the Michaelson match could prove to be important.
He was confident in himself, but he didn't have much to say.
"He has fully understood his role today, putting his hand on my shoulder and saying that he is ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's been a great team player for the past year, and he's done a lot for the team this year.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's what happened and that's how we thought about moving forward.
He wants to get on the field, just like everyone else."
In Sunday's match, Michaelson will surpass the record for most rider cup matches in Nick Foldo.
It could end up in a rider's cup career that doesn't even go through the credits of his personal record.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halfs, though Farrick says his presence brightens the team.
"He's a funny guy, amused, intelligent, loving to incite people, like being in a team room and a great guy," he said.
"I think the new players have enjoyed playing with him a lot, even this week, which is a lot of fun to watch.
He gives more than just a game."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjorn knows that even the big lead can disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that even on the last day of the Ryder Cup with the older lead, there can be uncomfortable situations.
Dean's debut in a 1997 match in Valderma, where the Savy Ballesteros-led side won five points to the Americans, but only in the narrowest margins won the finish line by a margin of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderama, where we won, but with a nominal margin," Björn said, adding that he is seen in the picture, winning 5-3 in the 2018 class at Le Golf National on Friday and yesterday.
History will show me and the team that it's not over yet.
Take full advantage of tomorrow.
Get on the field and do the right thing.
It doesn't end until it reaches the top of the board.
We have a goal, that is to try and win the trophy, and that's what our birds will have in the eyes.
I've always said that I'm looking at 12 players in my team, but we're also very conscious of who we are on the other side - the best player in the world."
Bjorn added, “I’m happy with the way our players have done in the tough golf courses. “I’ll never be super confident about that.
Tomorrow is a different fight.
Tomorrow will be a personal experience and it will be different.
It's great to be with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're alone on the field, your abilities as a golfer are fully tested.
This message needs to reach out to all the players, who will give the best tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your partner and get the best out of it."
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furick will be watching so that the players play better in person as a team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three points out of four points.
As part of the winning team in Hart and Brooklyn in the "Miracles in the Middle East" that took place in Europe, Furick himself experienced both side-effects of dramatic change on the last day.
Asked about how Ben Crenshaw inspired his players before the final day of 1999, he said, "I remember every word."
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you'll want to get rid of the fast start like Brooklyn and Medina.
When the game swings on one side, there is a lot of pressure on the mid-way matches.
We will make a line-up according to that and we will name the boys as we thought, we really want to do some magic tomorrow."
Top orders with Paul KC, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter have been given the responsibility of leading Thomas to the resistance against Europeans. He will face Rory McLurray in the opening match.
"I have arranged this team in this order, because in my opinion it will cover everything," Björn said of his singles selection.
Germany's new warships have been re-opened
According to local media reports, the T was scheduled to launch in 2014 with the German Navy's newest team to replace the previous Cold War-era warships, but that won't happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and snowballing costs.
The military spokesman, quoted by the D<0xC3><0xA9>jet newspaper, said the launch of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate's first ship "Rainland-Falz" has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is in trouble due to post-delivery problems.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigate.
It is reported that they will have powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as ready-made radars, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - it will be possible to deploy new frigates for a maximum of two years away from the country's port.
However, the continued delay means the state-of-the-art warships - which are supposed to assist Germany in energy exploration abroad - will get old at the time of the water's downfall.
The unfortunate F125 frigate came to head last year, when the German Navy formally refused to launch the ship, sending it back to Bloomberg and Vos Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a ship has returned to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Very little is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media mentions a number of important "software and hardware flaws" that will make the ship stand out in the war.
The glitches of the software are particularly important, as Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - half of the people of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was observed that the ship was overloaded which would reduce its performance and hinder the way the Navy's future upgrades were added.
The 7,000-tonne "Rainland-Falz" is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including training crews, is also becoming a problem.
The initial level has surprisingly reached <0xC2><0xA3>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) from <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
In the recent wake of Germany's naval power shortage warning, problematic new frigates have become even more important.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy was "leaving out the appropriate ship of Motain."
The official said that the problem has grown exponentially over time, as no replacement ships of the old ones were brought in.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class naval ships were able to join the Navy.
Getting to know the National Trust in the Secret Life of Bats
New research is being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Hills to find out how bats use groundnuts in search of food.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the behavior of this unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will continue to research common and soprano pipserelles and the Dabenton bats at the Innavoury Garden of Wester Ross.
Important places will be set up around the special recorder area to track the activity of the bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct ongoing surveys using portable detectors.
All recordings will be analysed by the expert to determine the frequency of the bat's call and what species are doing.
A landscape map and report will then be created to create a detailed geometry-scale image of their behavior.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the usefulness of habitat management, such as how to protect forests for grassroots creation and bats and other related species.
Over the past century, the number of bats in Scotland and the UK has decreased.
They are in danger of building and development work that harms their sleeping place and habitat.
Air-based turbines and lighting can also be hazardous, such as from some chemicals to flypapers and building materials, as well as threats to attack pets.
The mouse isn't really blind.
However, their ears are more effective than their eyes when it comes to catching prey because of the habit of hunting at night.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to identify hazards and obstacles on the way to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has given importance to bats.
They have ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, visit sleeping places, and sometimes do rescues.
The company has also set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve space at the 3rd Estate in Damfries and Gallo, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
estate manager David Thompson said the estate is the ideal area for bats.
"There's a good area for the three bats," he said.
"There are old buildings, there are old trees, and there are all good habitats.
But much more is still unknown about the bat, so what we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to survive."
He stressed the importance of knowing the presence of bats before taking care of the property, as it could potentially destroy 400 females and children bats, and wipe out the entire local herds.
It is illegal to kill, harass or harass or destroy animals that are protected by bats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of the Bats Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how many species live.”
Ronaldo has been accused of rape and lawyers are trying to bring a case against the German newspaper.
Calling the rape allegations against him "false news", he said people wanted to "promote their identity" by naming him.
His lawyers are set to file a lawsuit against German news magazine Der Spiegel, who has made the allegation public.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He has been charged with paying him <0x24>375,000 to remain silent about the incident, according to the Der Spiegel report on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, said the report was "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers on his Instagram live video hours after the claim was made public.
"No, no, no, no.
"What they said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to use my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by my name, but it's part of their livelihood.
"I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Dr Spiegel over the allegations, which they described as an "inappropriate report to be taken as suspicious in the matter of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the player "must seek compensation for moral damage, perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times."
The alleged incident took place in a suite at the Pams Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Myerga went to the player's house after they met at a nightclub where they allegedly raped him.
Myerga claimed that Ronaldo was benign after the incident and told him that he was disappointed for "99 percent" "good people", "one percent."
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it was agreed.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries to the hospital, but later agreed to settle outside the court, because she was "terrified by the fear of retribution" and was afraid of being "disgraceed in public."
The 34-year-old said she now wants to raise the issue again as she is mentally disturbed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was in the process of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the crime and joined the famous club Juve in Italy for a <0x24>100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: The UK will "forever regret" losing its position as a car manufacturer
Trade Minister Greg Clark said the UK would "extremely regret" if it lost its position as the first in the world to manufacture cars after Brexit.
He added that it was "surprising" that the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their factory in Bernston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker has said that a Brexit without a deal could result in people leaving their jobs due to border delays.
Barnston's factory - which produces Toyota Orris and Avanis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, about 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“My opinion is that if Britain exits the EU by the end of March, production at our factory could be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how to operate cross-border trade.
For example, BMW said it would close its mini plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns that car manufacturers say is the risk of supply chains in case of Brexit without a deal.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming from suppliers every 37 minutes for both UK and EU for ordered cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border, which could lead to delays in supplies and a shortage of parts.
The company said it was not possible to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at the Toyota Derbyshire plant, which could lead to the closure of production.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's checks plan for her future relationship with the EU was "appropriately formulated to avoid such checks at the border."
“We need a deal. We want to make the best deal that will not only hold success, but it will also make it possible to enjoy the prospect of future growth,” she said at a BBC Radio 4 event today.
"Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers are proving that it is very important to continue the successful system of supply chain."
Toyota is unable to say how long production will stop, but they have warned that over the long term additional costs will reduce the factory's competitiveness and could lead to many jobs being lost.
Peter Suvalaris, a United Union convener at the plant who has been working for 24 years in Bernston, said his members are increasingly concerned: “Once in my experience these works are gone, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We need to have a specific and credible plan for future relations with the EU.”
The White House has said that Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed.
The White House said on Sunday that a high-level meeting with Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosstein could be "more than a week behind" amid a row over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, an investigator investigating Russia's interference in elections, Trump's collaborators and possible obstructions to the president's trial.
Trump has been in Washington for the past few months questioning whether he will sack the deputy attorney general and whether he will question Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported on the use of secret mics to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
However, he was reported to have gone to the White House on Monday in the wake of reports that he was about to resign.
On Thursday, Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" Rosestein's dismissal, but Dr. Kristin Blaise Ford, one of the women accused of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh and her, both of whom received evidence, was postponed to avoid hearing the Senate Judiciary Committee.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding his meeting with Rosestein, he said: "No date has been fixed, it could be this week, it could be another week behind for all other current issues of the Supreme Court."
"I've always wanted to talk to the media."
Some journalists will oppose the statement, with Sanders no more press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked him the reason.
Sanders said that the reason for not having briefings is not for "showing people" to journalists, although he said: "I don't deny that they've done things to show people."
He also called for more direct communication between Trump and the press.
“The current president holds more questions than any previous president,” he said without specifying any evidence: “We have judged that number.”
"But if the media gets a chance to directly question the president of the United States, it's better than talking to me," Sanders said.
We try very hard to do that and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks and are going to be the place to talk directly to the President of the United States instead of press briefings."
Trump regularly receives questions when he leaves the White House or attends opening sessions or press conferences with distinguished guests.
There is very little press conference.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why, unplanned work, and sometimes a bizarre presence in front of a journalist's team.
Health Minister N.H.S. has written a letter to EU workers in Scotland on fears of Brexit
The Health Minister expressed his gratitude to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland and expressed his willingness to stay in the post-Brexit period.
Jean Freeman sent a letter to MSP, less than six months before leaving the UK.
The Scottish government has already pledged to meet the cost of the Settled Status app for EU citizens to work in the government services of the country.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: Negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit continue throughout the summer, which is expected to result in this autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a potentially unconfirmed situation.
I know you all are going through a difficult time.
That is why I would like to remind you once again how valuable their contribution to the nationalities of each member of the staff is to me.
Fellows from all over the European Union and beyond have brought valuable experiences and expertise that have strengthened and improved healthcare and benefitted patients and our communities.
Scotland is your own country and we want you to stay here."
Christian's emergency surgery after being hit in the head
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Azarkamby underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He's on the sideline and he's kind of confused," Reid said.
The trainers and medical staff provided oxygen to Abarrambi along the sideline and later he was brought back for further tests.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Azarambi was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/type of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
A second-year student wearing a red shirt is playing the first season with Akamrabi, Tennessee State, after moving from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before coming out of the game, with a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay more stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK.
Under the Tory plan, when foreign buyers buy new properties in the UK, they will have to pay more stamp duty and these extra money will be spent with the help of the homeless.
The move will mitigate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury hopes to raise more than <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay more stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK - and this extra money will be spent with the help of the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will mitigate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters as well as deliver more affordable housing and target high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will apply to individuals and organizations that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will be used by the government to help the homeless.
Surcharge - which, in addition to the current stamp duty, was imposed at a higher rate of 2nd house and rental house two years ago, could be more than 3 percent.
The Treasury is expected to raise revenue by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of London's newly built total assets are bought by residents outside the UK, for which prices have risen and make the situation more difficult for first-time housing buyers.
Most elite regions of the country - especially the capital - are becoming "unknown cities" in the crowd of foreign buyers who spend most of the time abroad.
The new policy comes weeks after the young generation was asked to reduce the Boris Johnson stamp duty, with the help of buying their first home.
He accused large construction companies of increasing property prices by not buying land, and called on Ms May to cancel the affordable house quota to solve Britain's "housing problem."
Mr Corbyn announced an interesting series of proposals for housing reform, including the abolition of rental control and the removal of "no-fault."
He wants to give the council more power to build new homes.
Ms May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - which is that life should be more beautiful for every new generation.
This means that the housing market will be destroyed.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be fair to say that foreign and foreign private companies that do not live in the UK will buy properties as easily as hard-working British residents.
Many people dream of owning a house, and the problem of homelessness remains very real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate dream is to take charge of Scotland.”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to be Scotland's manager someday.
The 42-year-old Scottish resident, who is currently enjoying the challenge of recovering the Northeast club, is now third in the league one, three points behind the first team.
Last season, he moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, bringing St. Martin back to the Scottish Premiership.
"I wanted to play for the country as a player.
"I got a B cap and so far," Ross told the BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland's game at Hampden with my father as a child and it always pulls me back.
Only if I succeed in running the club can this opportunity come."
Ross' predecessors as Sanderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Mayes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kane, Gus Poett and Paulo de Cani.
The former Alva Athletic boss said he did not feel any disappointment by rejecting the offer of established names for big clubs such as Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, it will be a measure of success for me, 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'"
"It's definitely worth the Premier League because of the structure and convenience in this club," he said.
“It’s not that easy to get there, but I’ll probably see myself as successful if I can bring the club back there.”
Ross' manager's lifespan is currently only three years after having 15 months as an assistant boss and a coaching staff at Harts.
He then helped to recover to the third level from the downturn and transform St. Mirren from the downturn to the championship title winner in the next season.
And Ross says he's more comfortable here than in Clyde, Hartlpool, Falkark, St. Mirren and Hamilton academic playing careers.
He recalled taking over the responsibility of lighting, “It was probably a real milestone.”
"I really believed that management is better for me than sports.
It's weird to hear because I've done everything right, lived a full life and enjoyed some success.
But it's hard to play
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same about the work pressure, but the management seems to be right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable thing on my own skin in my entire adult life."

Summer heatwaves have increased the crowds in Britain's smoked pubs, but the restaurant chain has put pressure on it.
Sales of pubs and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July - but figures showed that the restaurant's money collections fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant company, who compiled these statistics, said: "England's unanticipated prolonged participation in the World Cup means the same trend will continue in July as in June, when pub sales rose 2.8 percent and restaurant sales fell.
In June, the restaurant business fell 1.8 percent.
The main pubs and bars have done very well so far and the sale of restaurants has worsened.
Food major pubs are also suffering from heat failure, but they are not sold down like restaurants.
It's like people just want to go out for a drink.
Sales of all pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent this month, with food sales falling by 3%.”
Paul Newman of Retirement and Hospitality Analyst RSM said: "The trend for the end of April continues.
Weather and major social or sporting events have the most impact when it comes to selling on the market outside the home.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups will be in difficult situations, but a reduction of this 4.8 percent on sales each year will be particularly painful.
Food for the main operators may not come in bad times from long and hot summers, and the soft weather in August will tell the time when it will bring some comfort.”
In July, total sales in pubs and restaurants were up 2.7 percent, including new openings, reflecting a decline in sales in brand roll-outs.
The UK pub, bar and restaurant sector's coffer pitch tracker industry sales monitor has collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 million, and it's established industry standards.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children - some 11-year-olds - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 secondary school students has revealed an increase in the "nail insta" page
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
20% of students say they have a "major" account to show their parents
One in five children - some just 11-year-olds - are creating a social media account hiding from adults.
In the study of 20,000 secondary school students referred to the "nail insta"- photo sharing site Instagram, the account saw a rapid growth trend.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty-five percent of students said they had a transparent "main" account to show parents, as well as hidden.
A mother, who saw her 13-year-old daughter's hidden site, saw a teenager calling others to "rape me."
A study by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistress Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, half of whom have admitted to a secret account.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrisome that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Elizabeth Doyle to be a "Voice for Athletics" on the Scottish Athletic Board
At the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body, Elid Doyle has been elected as a member of the Scottish Athletics Board as an executive director.
Doyle Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beti described the move as a great opportunity for sports directors to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Elizabeth has great respect across the Scottish, UK and the world athletics community and we are sure it will greatly benefit him by bringing him to the athletics board in Scotland," BT said.
Doyle said: “I’m looking forward to working as a voice for athletes and I’m hopeful that I can really help Scotland’s sport and move it forward.”
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals, including 200m and 400m, in Atlanta in 1996 and is now a regular scholar of the BBC, has stopped walking after a single transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor told me how much time I would be able to recover.
It was a tough job, but now I've learned to walk again.
Thank you for the inspirational message!"
Women's health is more important than men and women in breastfeeding
A breast pump company has split the internet's opinion with an ad that compares baby mothers to breastfeeding cows.
On the occasion of the launch of the so-called "world's first soundless breast pump," consumer technology company LV has released a funny music video-type advertisement to showcase the freedom that the new pump offers to modern mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing with a straw-filled cow with a song that includes the lyrics: "Yes, I own milk, but I don't have a tail" and "If no one sees it, it's not an animal's butt, it's my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Pump, pump, repeat, I feed the children, I pump, I pray the milk of my girlfriends.”
However, the advertisement, which was released on the company's Facebook page, has sparked an online controversy.
The video received a mixed response from viewers in 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Many say it highlights the "fearfulness" of the dairy industry.
"The use of this product in advertising is a very bad decision.
"They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth, the difference is that their babies are stolen from them within a few days of birth," one wrote.

Another commented: "It's obviously disappointing for both mother and child.
"Why don't they use their mother-in-law's milk to feed their children?"
Another said: "A very uncomfortable advertisement."
While others are standing next to the ad, a woman admits that the song seemed to be her "happiness."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I had a baby, I would have a baby too.
I feel like a cow when I'm pumping.
It's a bit crazy, but I've done it well.
"It's an innovative product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a juicy ad that she focuses on mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and think of themselves as a "horse."
This advertisement does not praise or criticize the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all danced with the pump hidden in their bra.
The advertisement is based on the idea that many women feel like cows while pumping breast.
Although the LV pump is completely noiseless, it does not have a tube and fits nicely into the nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to walk, put on baby collars, and even go out when pumping.
Anna Ballerin, mother's partner and ECD said: "The LV pump is a revolutionary product that should start courageously and vigorously.
Drawing parallel images of women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all of its challenges to the spotlight, revealing the incredible feeling of release that the new pump will bring in in an entertaining and related way.
The LV pump did not make it to the news for the first time.

Hundreds of migrant children have been taken to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, as the Trump administration's strict rules and policies have made it more difficult for children to keep their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors fear losing the chance to live in their own country by claiming immigrants and children without paperwork.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their family would have to submit fingerprints, and the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior immigration and tariff enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of orphaned children.
The agency later said that 70 percent of those arrested had no past criminal history.
"About 80 percent of Spencer's family members are in the country illegally and a large part of them are known to be criminals.
"We're still looking for them," said Alberto.
In an effort to bring the children back to society more quickly, officials introduced some new rules, including those to appear in court within a month of their detention, which was 60 days earlier, shelter workers said.
Many immigration judges will not be personally present during their case for legal status through videoconferencing calls.
Those who do not receive relief will be immediately deported.
According to the shelter staff and the report released from the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent incidents or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more severe in large centers such as Toronto, where children are more likely to be ignored because of their size.
They also said that if children are not mentally prepared or moved to the center without enough time to say goodbye to their friends, many people may experience the trauma a few times more so that they are already suffering.
The U.S., French and Turkish "capital forces" have called for Syria to be withdrawn immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moalem called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been in a prolonged eight-year war.
Moylem, who is also the country's deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on the country's soil for the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will take appropriate measures."
"They have to leave now without conditions," he told the council.
Moylem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been forced to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight "until all Syrian territory is cleared" against both terrorists and "illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the question of refugees, Molayem said the situation was conducive to their return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading "unreasonable fear" that prompted refugees to stay away.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with this return," he said.
"They're dealing with a whole human problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given any restructuring assistance until a political deal is reached to end the war between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a buffer zone at Idlib's last major rebel base has provided an opportunity to advance through political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey deal has prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the area, where three million people live.
However, Moylem stressed that the deal has "a clear deadline" and expressed the hope that the military action will work against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eliminated."
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee comprising members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution soon and pave the way for elections.
Molayem expressed the condition of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be restricted to "reviewing paragraphs of the current constitution," and warned against undesirable interference.
Why Trump Won the Second Round
In this argument, Trump will win the 2020 re-election, as many Liberals expect his presidency to end soon due to impeachment and scandal.
This will be the "most dramatic end of a president."
So far, there has been no change in the views of the audience.
Since 2014, the prime-time rating on CNN has more than doubled to nearly 1.05 million and in terms of MSNBC it has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
The average prime-time viewership of Fox News has increased from 1.7 million last year to about 2.4 million, according to Neelsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Mado Show" tops the ratings with about 3.5 million viewers on the big news night.
Regarding a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack, the director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" said, "It's a fire that's attracting people, because it's beyond our understanding."
There is another theory in the works of veteran comedy writer Neil Scovel and "Just the Funny Parts: and Some Hidden Hard Truths at the Hollywood Boys Club."
He recalled a taxi trip before the 2016 election.
The driver asked him if he was voting for Mr. Trump.
Why? He asked.
"She said, 'Because she's funny and funny,'" Ms. Schowell told me.
There are also some entertainment costs.
Of course, things that arise from Washington, unlike anything else on TV, can determine the future of Ro Five. Wait to see if immigrant families can reunite and what the global economy is like.
Turning around is a luxury that only has the capacity of the most advantageous audience.
And despite that, a conscious citizen’s understanding will go beyond when you see a panel of experts arguing for six hours about the use of “deep background” for Bob Woodward’s “fierce” book, and Paul Manafort’s statement on the <0x24>15,000 Utpakhri-shar bomber jacket (The Washington Post says “much clothing with Hubris”) and Mr. Trump’s comments on Utreen.
I don't think I'll ever see Super Mario again.
Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pon Stars", said, "Some part of what he's doing is like the reality show, he's doing something funny every night."
You can't miss a party or not.
While talking to Mr. Flies this week, there were 80 sunny weather outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but despite the fact that he was sitting at home recording CNN to watch MSNBC.
He could not get out of the face of Brett Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging.
"I remember when we had great shows in all those days and people would say, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Flies told me.
"I thought it was a good idea, but it's real."

In the mid-term elections, money has flown like a floodwater.
It is not surprising that the money is flying in the 17th ballot in Pennsylvania, as two candidates are fighting for the same seat in favor of a congressional district reorganization.
The newly-recognised suburbs of Pittsburgh District have brought Democratic Representative Conor Lamb to the fight - who won another seat in a special election last spring.
Lamb is fighting against Republican Keith Rothfoss, who is currently representing the 12th District of Old Pennsylvania, much of which is part of the new 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were constitutionally incompatible with the Republicans, due to which the map was redistributed.
This election battle in the new 17th district has drawn major parties into the money-laundering contest between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
In March, Lamb became famous after winning the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania's widely circulated special election by a narrow margin.
The seat was held by Republicans for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The Democrats are making little progress.
El Salvador sentenced to death for backing U.S.
Diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, a little behind from Washington.
Mr Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Verella in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama, but later the partners removed the Trump Organization's directorial team.
State Department spokesman Heather Noort said in a statement earlier this month that the department's officials "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan" decided to bring back American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But the punishment was announced only against El Salvador, who received nearly <0x24>140 million as American relief in 2017 in the drug control, development, and economic support sector.
The proposed penalty, which included the waiver of financial aid and the specific visa ban, could have been painful for the country of Central America due to its high unemployment and murder rate.
As the internal meeting progressed, officials in North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a step to prevent the influx of immigrants to the United States like last year.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted to hold the conference, effectively ending El Salvador's chances of being sentenced.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, so that the administration will deliver the message of import.
And the American ambassadors of the three countries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong message or punishment from Washington.
Mr Bolton declined to comment on the statement made by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
An external analyst close to the administration confirmed their statement and he also refused to disclose the name.
Read the history
The next inevitable event could be Robert Mueller's special report on the possible obstacles to Mr. Trump in law, which now has enough evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller's investigation into whether Mr. Trump had any links with Russia during the election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr Trump will have to take on his responsibility, just as he prepares to go back to the voters, and eventually perhaps even go before the jury with his colleagues.
There are a lot of issues, and I'm not saying Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, or his European complement.
We will have the choice of our two arrows on how long this conflict will last.
In 1938, German officials might have "couped" Hitler, unless the West stopped him and stood by the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and have missed the opportunity to avoid many years of murder.
The course of history often takes such a turn, and it accelerates and sometimes delays the overwhelming pace of democracy.
This has happened in American history as well.
What should we do if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who will determine the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation.
Rosenstein has been in danger since it was published on paper last year that he secretly suggested recording the president's words and guessed about his own incompetence in his position.
Mr Rosenstein said that the news of the Times is false.
"What if the FBI investigation that has just begun against Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is proven innocent in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?"
The big question is, will we elect a Congress that can blame Mr Trump in the midterm elections?
If we fail this test, democracy will go to winter for a long time.
But I believe we will not fail, because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, who was once exiled by the same Nazis who occupied the house of my embassy.
He survived, fled to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the lamp of Sabath at a table marked with swastika.
With this history, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers' Graham Dorans Rapids is optimistic ahead of the Vietnam War
The Rangers will play their own Rapid Vienna on Thursday, winning against the Austrians after a great draw against Villareal in Spain earlier this month, giving them a good chance to qualify for the G group in the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorans played his first match of the season with Villarreal in a 2-2 draw, but he believes they will be able to get to a better place by relying on the result.
"This point is very important, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We came out on the field with confidence and got a point.
I could have won in the end, but overall, the draw is a fair result.
They played well in the first half and our team played well in the second half.
Thursday is another important night on the European stage.
Hopefully, we get three points, but it will be a tough game, because they had a good result in their last game, but I'm sure with the support of the audience we can get positive results.
Last year wasn't very good, because of my injuries and the changes that have taken place in the club, there are elements of good feeling in the current position.
Our team is also very good and the boys are also very well-trained.
"I am hopeful that we can go ahead and succeed, leaving last season behind."
Women are losing their sleep over retirement savings.
Despite having an idea of how the participants in the study dealt with it, very few people have talked about it with their family members.
Nearly half of the respondents said they had spoken to their spouses about the long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to think about them, but they are not taking steps for this conversation," said Holly Schneider, vice president of the life insurance business at Nationwide.
You know where to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: If you do not express your wishes well enough before time, you will not be able to prepare your family for your ministry.
Work in touch with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you would like to receive care, as it is also very important to determine the cost of your choice.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can look for solutions to deal with these costs.
Your financing choice for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy if you have money - a hybrid cash-valued life insurance policy or self-insurance with your own resources to help with these expenses.
Solution bar from your legal documents: Try to stay away from legal fights.
Take a proper health care proxy so that you nominate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and so that if you are unable to communicate, the professional will comply with your wishes.
Think of a power of attorney for your property.
Choose a trusted person to make your financial decisions and make sure that your bill is paid properly when you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little things: Remember that your elderly parents need emergency treatment and are being taken to a hospital.
Are you aware of your current health and fitness?
Keep these things in a written plan so that you can be prepared.
"It's not just an economic issue, it's also a medical issue," said Martin.
"What's going on with the medication now?"
Who will take care of the dog?
Make all the plans."
Man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle on his way home after spending the night outside.
The victim, 40-year-old Davon, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hands.
Officials said the "separate" incident took place at 02:30 BST.
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries were not serious and the police have applied for a witness.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll could rise further.
As the communication was disconnected, the relief authorities could not report any news in the Dongla Regency area north of Palu, which is near the epicentre of the 7.5-square earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been rescued from Palu after the disaster.
Some important information about Palu and Dongla in Sulawesi Island:
The capital of the state of Central Sulawesi is Palu, located at the end of a narrow creek on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunamis hit the city.
Dongla is a reserve that extends about 300 km (180 mi) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The state has a population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main sources of economy in the Central Sulawesi state, especially in the coastal areas of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the state, but most of it is located in Morowali, opposite the Sulawesi coast.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Dongla have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed about 200 people in Dongala and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, there was also a tsunami attack in Dongala, in which nine people died.
Indonesia is often hit by earthquakes as it is located in the Pacific Ocean's volcanic zone.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred recently:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed more than 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom are in Aceh.
2005: After several powerful earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: Indonesia's most populous island, Java, is hit by a 6.8-magnitude earthquake, causing a tsunami to hit the south coast and killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude quake hits the capital of western Sumatra near the city of Padang.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake hits one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing dozens of villages to be hit by a 10-metre-high tsunami that killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake hits the Achehar PD Jaya Regency, triggering panic and instigating the horrific memories of the 2004 tsunami.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed.
2018: A major earthquake hit Indonesia's tourism island of Lombo, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of homes were destroyed and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, Alaska's governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, 29-year-old Palin has been arrested on charges of domestic violence and attempts to avoid domestic violence and arrest.
According to the police report, when a known woman went to call the police in connection with the incident, she snatched the phone from her.
Pauline has been placed in an unsecured bond of <0x24>500 for the custody of Matt-Sue Pretrial Facility, KTUU reported.
He was produced before a court on Saturday, where he was told by the network that he had claimed himself to be a "confirmed innocent."
He was charged with a class A crime, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a fine of up to <0x24>250,000.
There are also charges of Class B offenses, which could lead to a one-day jail and a <0x24>2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal complaint has been filed against Paul.
He was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Philip, in December 2017.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police for the attack.
The case is currently pending in Alaska's veterinary court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and was accused of using weapons in a state of domestic violence and intoxication.
His wife accused him of slapping him in the face.
In 2016, the Veterans Group criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's violent behavior to his PSTD service in Iraq.
Earthquake Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake created a tsunami that devastated thousands of homes.
Power and communication systems have collapsed and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The tremors were felt near Central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The video of the incident has gone viral on social media.
When the tsunami hit the shore, hundreds of people gathered to take part in the beach festival in Palu city.
Federal prosecutors seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Cyfullo Sippov, who was involved in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This rare sentence has not been given to anyone since 1953.
It is alleged that the 30-year-old Saipov, using a home depot rental truck, carried out an attack in October on a bike ride on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in order to force cyclists and pedestrians to be hit.
According to a notice filed in the South District of New York praying for the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Syepov was "intentionally killing" eight people and "intentionally" inflicting serious injuries.
According to court documents, both of them are sufficient to execute the death penalty.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury has filed 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of murder, which are commonly associated with organized crime, and charges of violence and car destruction.
Referring to the manner in which Cypov carried out the "serious, brutal and deviant" attack, prosecutors said it needed "sufficient planning and preconditions."
"The reasons for the injury, damage and damage to the family and friends of Saifulo Habibulaevich Sippov are: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, An-Lara Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Arles, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Dom.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last execution by the New York South District took place more than a decade ago.
Khalid Burns was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal case in New York was executed in 1953 against a married couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were charged with espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenberg couple were both sentenced to death by sitting in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sipov, a resident of Uzbekistan, has not expressed any regrets, the court reported.
Police said they were happy when the incident happened.
Sipov told officials that he was inspired by the ISIS video on his cell phone.
Police said they have also requested for the installation of the ISI flag at their hospital.
He pleaded guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the counsel's decision.
“We believe that the trauma of the incident will prolong the life sentence for everyone involved in the decision to seek the death penalty rather than grant life imprisonment,” said Patton.
Sipov's legal team had previously appealed for the death penalty for prosecutors.
Tory said that Nigel Farage should be given the responsibility of a Brexit up-to-date debate.
Nigel Farage has pledged to "integrate the people-force" at a rally in Tori today.
The former U.K. leader said politicians "have received a touch of security" from Eurosceptics - when Theresa May's own MP said she should be given the responsibility of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter's sister said at a rally in Birmingham that if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary, the UK would have already "come out" of the EU.
But the ice cream that Mrs May is eating to keep her deeply divided ranks in one place became clear once more, when she took part in another anti-Brexit protest in the city of Tories.
One of these Brexit-backed checkers is warming up to keep the deal right in the middle of anti-Brexit and EU attacks.
His allies have insisted that despite opposition, a deal with Brussels would force Europesceptics and Labour to make a choice between its package and "disturbation."
Mr. Sister Solihale said at the Live Mins Live rally that she wanted 'chak checkers'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a colleague and be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have come out of it,” he said.
Welinborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but need chalk checkers.”
He said to his opponents: “We did not fight for survival.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Sister has ruled out the possibility of changing people’s opinions after the 2016 vote. “The idea that the British people want to remain in the EU is completely untrue.”
Andre Jenkins, a supporter of Tory Brexit, was also at the rally, who told reporters: “All I want to say is: listen to the Prime Minister, the people.
“Checkers are disliked by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is also disliked by the people and activists of our party who have brought us here.
"Shut up and listen to the checkers."
Speaking to Ms May in a sharp voice, she said: “The Prime Minister is thinking about his position where his promise should be fulfilled.”
Speaking at the rally, Mr Farage said politicians should be forced to understand the "disturbing situation" if they were betrayed by the 2016 referendum decision.
“It’s now a matter of trust between people and politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’ll tell them, ‘If we do that, we won’t let you run away.’
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: “I want politicians who are trying to betray Brexit, to face the ugly situation.
“We are driving the people who have brought us victory in the Brexit and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud UK.”
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters staged a two-hour march through the city centre in Birmingham.
A group of activists demonstrated Brexit banners against Tories after they were formed this weekend.
Labour leaders have ridiculed the Conservatives at the Adonis conference after they suffered a security problem in a party app.
“Some people are telling us that they can maintain uninterrupted border, free trade at the Irish border, Canada’s plus plus and IT systems,” he added.
“It’s a full-scale process.
"It's not a good Brexit," he added.
Warren is considering a "strict look" at being a presidential candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will be deeply concerned about running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who often criticizes President Trump, is fighting against GOP State candidate Geoff Deel in the November election, who was vice president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There is a debate surrounding him being able to compete with Trump in the 2020 election.
The 36th meeting with its organisers was held in the town of Holi on Saturday evening after Trump took office.
One of the participants questioned him about his candidacy for the presidency.
"The time has come for us to take over this broken government under the leadership of a woman," Warren said.
Man arrested for shooting at LSSU's Sims
Batton Rouge, LA Police said on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for shooting LSU basketball player Wed Sims on Friday.
The 20-year-old Deton Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m., the Batton Rouge police department said.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, requesting the person to identify the footage.
Sims, a 20-year-old man, was shot dead on Friday morning on the campus of Southern University.
Police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media that "Wed Sims was shot dead in the head," reports 247Sports.
Wed was attacked by Simpson while trying to save his friend.
Simpson was taken into custody and admitted to being on the scene, found weapons, and also confessed to shooting Wed Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Batton Rouge grew to 6 feet 6 junior highs, played 10 matches from start to finish and played a total of 32 matches last season, an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Luis Hamilton joins Sebastian Vettel in winning the title
It became clear when Valtery Bottas qualified ahead of Hamilton on Saturday and said the order of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Bots started well from Pol, ignoring Hamilton almost and holding his position to the first two left and inviting Vettel to attack his own team player.
Vettel left Hamilton behind the crowd and went into the pit, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes driver patted on the next lap and followed Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the fight, so that the Ferrari driver left the inside empty with a double-moved risk of undefeated opportunities.
Max Verstappen began his 21st birthday with a back row and was seventh after the first lap.
He then went on to win most of the races first, then beat Kimi Raikonen to fourth place with a bad tyre.
He pitched the 44th lap, but the remaining eight laps could no longer speed up, leaving Raikonen in fourth place.
It was a tough day, as Valtery fought the entire weekend and acted like a real gentleman.
"The team is doing a great job at first," Hamilton said.
It was a bad body language.
US President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Finchstein at a rally on Saturday over allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about the issue, but instead said what was happening in the Senate was "low and nasty and false" mentality of the people.
"This is one thing that could have happened and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few weeks, you'll see anger when you see the low and the ugly and the liar," he said.
"When they see the information leaked, they will say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.'
"Oh, I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dean Fenstein, did you catch it?
Remember the answer to your question: "Oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I didn't catch it."
Hey, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't, we didn't," he said.
In July, the letter was sent to Ford Finstein, describing allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked in September - but Finstein denied the letter was leaked from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak anything," Finstein told the committee.
"He told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret according to his word."
But he did not hesitate to speak to the president, he said at a Saturday night's rally: "I say what happened, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen a body language worse than that."
Speaking in favour of three women accused of sexual misconduct by the Supreme Court, the President said the Democrats are using the allegations to their own ends.
"They want to get power back at any cost.
"Look at the low mindset, look at the rudeness, don't force them to hurt anyone, don't force anyone to get power and control," the president said.

For the Giants, Patrick Dyer scored two goals against Dandi.
The Dundee Stars beat Belfast Giants in Friday's Elite League match to win the match back to Dandi on Saturday by 5-3 goals.
The Giants quickly moved on to the goals of Patrick Dyer and Francis Bevillia.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan returned to their home team and the Giants went on to score goals again.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dandi and then Lucas Landwalt Nielsen scored two goals.
This was Adam Kief's third defeat in the Elite League, which came back in Belfast on Friday night and lost 2-1 to Dandi.
The two teams met four times this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Darryr's first goal came in the fourth minute of the game at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McAfee, who doubled Bevillia's lead with the help of David Rutherford four more minutes later.
In a push towards the start of the game, Salivan brought the host back to the game at 13:10 minutes and later at 15:16 with the help of Matt Markert to bring the team back to parity.
At the end of the first half, Dyer scored his second goal to make sure the Giants went ahead.
The welcome team returned to the game and Bucharest again scored a power play goal in 27:37 minutes.
Connie and Charles Corcoran helped Nealson advance to the game for the first time at the end of the second half and eventually ensured the lead in the game.

Air traffic controllers have confirmed the lives of hundreds of people on board the plane in exchange for their lives.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been awarded the title of hero after he died while trying to fly a plane with more than 100 passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many others are missing on Friday on the island of Sulawesi in a tsunami triggered by a major earthquake.
Strongly followed by tremors, the area is repeatedly shaking and people are trapped in the ruins of Palu.
But despite all the co-workers fleeing for fear of death, 21-year-old Antonias Gunawan Palur Mutiyara did not leave the control tower at Sis al-Juffari Airport.
He left and confirmed that BATIC Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could fly safely.
Then he jumped down in fear that the control tower would collapse.
He later died at the hospital.
Indonesian Air Force spokesman Johns Cerite said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken after hearing the news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach tens of thousands, the disaster management agency said communications in Dongala, Sigi and Butong cities had been limited.
"The death toll is believed to be rising, as many bodies are trapped under debris that have not yet been reached," said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Puroyo Nugroho.
The six-metre-high wave led to destruction in Palu, where mass graves will be arranged on Sunday.
Relief and assistance is being provided by military and commercial aircraft.
The 35-year-old mother, Resha Kusuma, told Sky News: “The body is coming in ambulance every minute.” The body is coming in ambulance every minute.
Clean water is not available.
Small markets have been looted everywhere."
Jane Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is quickly taking help to the survivors, but we don't know what we'll see there.
It's already sad, but the situation can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Sunday: "I request you to continue with the rescue work day and night.
"Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia's Lombo was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Newgeny says one of the missing in Lego plane crash
One of the airline's planes crashed in the Pacific leg of Micronesia, where they previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Newgeny said in a report on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was not found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find out.
The airline immediately refused to provide details of the passenger's age and nationality.
Some local boats helped rescue passengers and staff after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chak Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were also in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane fell into the water before reaching the runway.
A number of witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jens said the plane went down very low.
"It's a good thing," Jensen said.
Jens said he and the others reached the emergency door of the plane sinking through the waist water.
He said the passengers were screaming in horror and had a slight injury on their head.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working on a jetty near Sarai also helped in rescue operations, bringing people to shore by boat before the plane sank 30 metres (100 ft) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the PNG-related airline over the past two decades, but there have been no accidents in Air New Guinea.
Researchers have found that a woman's body was burned during the
The prosecution on Saturday filed a case against a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. judicial analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described before the jury how the 29-year-old co-accused Quinton Teles and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers made the night of her death using a cellphone record.
Rowlett said he retrieved a number of cellphone data that showed that the teles and chambers were together on the evening of the death, which was against the previous telecommunications lobby, Clarion Laser's report.
Reports suggest that he was with his cell phone chambers at the time, although he pretended to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police said.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that night.
When prosecutors asked whether Teles was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that it was "a lie because his truck was in Nashville that day."
Another inconsistencies is that Teles said he knew her two weeks before Chambers' death.
Cell phone records show that they have known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles deleted text, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He saved his life," said Haley.
The final arguments in the case are scheduled for Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go to court the next day.

Bristol's The High Bride, dubbed that hip hop has withdrawn from the mainstream of its political message and social problems.
They want to return to their original stream and re-populate the Consulship Hip Hop.
Artists like The Fuses and Common have recently seen a resurgence in the UK through artists like Akala and Loki.
There's another black man?!
New York Nanny has filed a lawsuit against a couple for being fired after a "discrimination" test.
A New York-based Nanny is suing the concerned couple for discriminatory expulsion from a mother, calling her "another black."
The couple denied the allegation of being racially discriminatory and sought a case on charges of "Julum."
The mother of two children, Lincy Plsko-Falxman, expressed disappointment after arriving on the first day of work in 2016, when she learned that Giselle Morris, a black child's new caregiver, was a black man.
"Naaaaaaaaa another black," Ms. Plasco-Falxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead, she sent it to her husband, Mrs. Morris, twice.
Later realizing his mistake, "disgusting" Plasco-Falxman ousted Miss Morris. He said that his previous nanny, who was African-American, had expected a Filipino to act badly, according to a New York Post report.
Mrs. Morris was given a one-day mine and then called Uber and sent home.
Morris is now filing a lawsuit against the couple for compensation in the extradition case and seeking compensation of <0x24>350 a day for six months, although he was first hired as a housewife without a deal.
"I want to show them, look, that can't be done," he told the post on Friday, adding, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple argued against their claims of being racist that the expulsion of Morris was a reasonable act of fear that he could not be trusted after making a complaint against him.
"He didn't want to say what my wife sent me.
He is not a racist.
"We're not a racist couple," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But will you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you've abused, even if it's wrong?"
your children's?
Tell me."
Plasco said his wife gave birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you want to fight someone like that?"
"It's not a good thing to do," said the banker.
In the wake of the ongoing legal case, the public court has strongly condemned the couple's behaviour and reasoning on social media.
The Paddington publication fears that readers may not be able to relate to the bear talking, published in a new paper.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to say what the mind of the first person to read before publication.
It's interesting to know that after Paddington's great success.
His father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before getting inspiration from a small toy bear to write children’s books, said he was hopeful of rejection of his work. He also said that he had “amlamuddh” for the 60th anniversary of publishing the book after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," said his father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man, and not a hypocritical man," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that it was as if your own child had achieved some success: you're proud of him, even if you don't have a role in it."
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it is the fruit of his own creation and imagination, he always credits Paddington himself.
My daughter was on her way to death and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was quickly taken to Nice Hospital, Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad used to call regularly to say that it was bad, and she wouldn't survive," Ms. Eden-Laperoz said.
"Then I got Nad's phone and found out that he was going to die in two minutes and I was forced to say goodbye to him on the phone.
And I do that.
I said, "Sweetheart, I love you so much.
I'll be coming to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medicines the doctors gave to keep his heart on were gradually stopping working on his body and getting out of the body.
He died a little while ago and then it all stopped.
I had no choice but to wait.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold myself."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperoz, then lamenting the death of her daughter, boarding the plane along with other passengers - she was indifferent to this difficult situation.
No one knows," he said.
“I had my head down, and my eyes were watering.
It's impossible to describe it, but I was sitting on the plane and dealing with Nad's untimely pain.
He needs my love and compassion.
I know how much he loved her.
The woman posted a suicide note on the bridge.
Two women, who lost their loved ones to suicide, work to stop the suicide of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries posted cards with inspirational messages at the Welsh Bridge and put up a phone number where people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm doing all the time," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a promising chef and had an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said, "His smile brightens the house."
However, he quit work before he died, because he "was really gone in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, found him dead.
Ms Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this effort will fall apart.”
Miss Davis wrote: "To let everyone know that there is someone you can talk to, he can be a friend.
Don't sit still, you need to talk.
Mrs. Humphries, the girlfriend of Mrs. Davis for many years, has lost her 15-year-old partner Mark, just after her mother's death.
"He never said that his mind was bad or he was depressed or anything else," she said.
"I noticed a few changes in his use two days before Christmas.
"He was in a very bad condition on Christmas Day - when the kids were opening their presents he didn't even open his eyes to them."
He said his death was a huge psychological blow to him, but he had to overcome it: "It created a huge void in the family.
He's ruined us.
But we have to go and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the wake of the FBI investigation
“I thought, if we could give him something he wanted – since the investigation time is limited, the opportunity is limited – we could probably bring some unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday. He added that he feared, the committee might “fall into a wedge” in the wake of this biased stalemate.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their obligations are related to time.
On November 6, the midterm elections are just five weeks away - if, as expected, Republicans do a bad job, their efforts to get the likes in the country's highest court will be very weak.
George W. Bush is calling senators and lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House under Mr. Bush. Through him, Mr. Bush met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is submitted?
There will be a vote in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and secure him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's "defeat" under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean rebels has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Beyong-Seg, quoted data from South Korea's Ministry of Consolidation, saying the number of dissidents last year was 1,127 - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the main reason for the tight border control between North Korea and China and the siphoning of money from human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment on the matter.
A large number of North Koreans have been granted South Korean citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them have fled to China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross the highly protected unarmed zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers these refugees not as refugees, but as illegal immigrants and often forcibly return them to their countries.
Relations between North and South Korea - who are still in the midst of the war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization of the country.
This comes after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they fairly agreed to work towards creating a nuclear weapons-free Korean peninsula.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed the U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr Ri said, "If the United States does not have any confidence in our national security, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves in such a situation."
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Kavanaugh "hysteria-granted". She said she was ineligible to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as "hysteria-grass" and said he was "naturally inappropriate" in his duties to the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday that she had "never thought that if a woman had ever done such a thing, she would have been called "hysteria-grammed."
Kavanaugh has strongly denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaise when they were both teenagers.
At the time of his initial statement, Kavanaugh was passionate about his family and high school life, screaming and holding his breath.
He categorically condemned the Democrats on the committee and called the charges against him a "innovative and egalitarian character" organized by the Liberals, alleging that it was being done from Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election rage of defeat.
Pelosi said he believed Kavonaf's evidence proved that he was not worthy of the Supreme Court because it proved that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he has proved himself incompetent in the statement he made and the manner in which Clinton and the Democrats opposed it," he said.
When asked if Kavanaugh would impeach him if he was convinced, and if Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi expressed unhappiness.
"I'd say -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, not only does he deserve the Supreme Court, but the court he's in right now is also ineligible," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was worried that he would oppose the Cavanaugh Affordable Care Act or the Roe V. Wade, as he himself is a Conservative Justice.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It can't be that the hysteria-grade, biased person goes to court and tells us 'Isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to control it.
It's a fair debate, months and years of anger coming out, and he can't cry.
"We cry when we're angry," Ms Steinme told me after 45 years.
"I don't think it's rare, what do you say?"
“A woman executive helped me a lot, who said that she would cry when she was angry too, but she chose the approach that when she started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, “You might feel sorry because I’m crying.”
I'm really angry."
Then he continued.
I thought it was great."
Tears partially act as an expression of anger, because they are primarily victims of misunderstandings.
I had a sharp memory of an early job, a man-in-chief office, where once I saw myself crying with incredible anger, an old woman holding my scarf - I was always a little scared of a terrible manager - who dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't let them see that you're crying," she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see you."
Patrick Schroeder, then Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with him during the presidential election of Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a foreign ship called Manki Business and left the race for dirty work, deeply disappointed Mr. Schroeder thought there was no reason for him not to be a candidate for his own presidency.
"It's not a good idea," he said, smiling 30 years later.
"There are seven other candidates in the fray, and no one else wants to.
One called it "snow white and seven dwarves."
As the campaign was delayed at the start, he was lagging behind in fundraising, and so he insisted that he would not run the race without raising <0x24>2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He saw that a supporter was given <0x24>1,000 if he was given only <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'm going to get a price cut?" he said.
When he announced that he would not run the official campaign, he was extremely appreciative of his passion and his supporters, making it difficult to collect money, as a result of which he targeted voters, excluding representatives, and getting angry about gender inequality.
"You might think I've had a nervous breakdown," said Ms. Schroeder, recalling the media's betrayal.
"You might think that Clenx is my corporate sponsor.
I wonder where they're going to bury me.
"He was crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can go to Beijing
The first phase of the U.S.-China trade war was fierce, and while in the final stages of the war, Beijing could benefit in the long run, like experts.
US President Donald Trump earlier this year raised taxes on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most notable passage has been this week, when almost half of the total imports from China are in goods, amounting to about <0x24>200 billion (150 billion pounds), new tariffs are placed.
Beijing has retaliated as much as every time - most recently they have raised five to ten percent tariffs on US goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has decided to fight with eyes closed and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to take its eyes off soon.
Washington's withdrawal would mean a reversal of the claim, but it would be extremely humiliating for Chinese President <0x58>i Jinping to publicly bow down to the US.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play Tas correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can help China positively in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"Any quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could lead to economic downturns in both countries is far more dangerous than the perception of the Waqf Circle," said Abigail Grace, associate researcher at the Center for New American Security, a think tank company that discusses Asia.
Syria is “ready” to take back its refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says the country is ready to return refugees voluntarily, and calls for the seven-year-old war-ravaged country to be rebuilt.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mowaleem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation is stable and secure because of the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now favourable for the voluntary return of the people who are forced to leave the country due to the loss of daily life and livelihood due to terrorism and the surrounding economic conditions.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mwaleem said the Syrian government welcomed all support for the reconstruction of the country.
However, he insisted that no conditional assistance would be taken or any help would be taken from the country that supports the rebels.
Europe's winner of the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by 16.5-10.5 final score at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The U.S. lost to Europe six times in a row and have never won a Ryder Cup since 1993.
Team Europe, led by Danish captain Thomas Beyonce, reached the required 14.5 points to beat the United States and regained the title.
U.S. star Phil Mikkelson, who did not play well in most of the tournament, hit his T-shot in the 16th hole, and lost his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinary became one of only 1 in 4 to score above 5-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979, showing brilliant performances in all rounds.
American Jordan Spieth, the European team's lowest-ranked player, has been beaten 5 and 4 by Thorbjern Olsen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
Experienced in the eight-time Ryder Cup, Sergio Garcia of Spain has the most wins in Europe with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but this time I can't.
It's been a bad year.
Thank you for believing in me and trusting in me.
I'm so glad I got the cup back.
"It's a success of the team, I'm happy that I've been able to help," Garcia said excitedly at the European victory.
He handed over his country to John Ram, who lost to US Legend Golfer Tiger Woods in the 2nd and 1st in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm so proud to have lost Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old John Ram.
Woods has lost four of his matches in France, setting his record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
It's an absurd statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 major titles only after the top-ranked Jack Nichols.
Without high-quality performance performers Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, the team has slumped all weekend in the US.
U.S. captain Jim Furrick said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of them, they've fought.
We put a lot of pressure on Europe this morning.
We couldn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good leader.
All 12 of his players played very well.
"We will move on, I will work with the PGA and the Rider Cup Committee of the United States.
I love all 12 of them and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to respect them.
We didn't play."
Red current update: decreases density in pinellas, manatees, and Sarasota
A new report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in the concentration of red currents in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, the Bloom situation in Pachia has been observed in the counties of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collia - a sign of density reduction.
The Bloom of the Red Stream extends along a coastline of about 130 miles from North Pinellas to South Lee County.
Patches can be seen about 10 miles from the shores of Hillsboro County, but are less noticeable than last week.
Red tides have also been observed in Pasco County.
The median density on and off the coast of Pinellas County last week, less than the coast of Hillsboro County, the density of Bashi in Manati County, the higher density on and off the Sarasota County coast, the median density in Charlotte County, the low density on the Lee County coast, and the low density in Cologne County.
Respiratory problems are still being reported from the counties of Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota, Lee and Colia.
No respiratory problems have been reported from northwest Florida in the past week.
