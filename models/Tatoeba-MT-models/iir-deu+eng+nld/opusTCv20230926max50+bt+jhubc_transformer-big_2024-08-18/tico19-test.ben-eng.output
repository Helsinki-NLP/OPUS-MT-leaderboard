The rapid increase in cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from 1 January to 15 March 2020 in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK
The reported cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) show a similar trend between the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the UK that ensures that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to progress rapidly in all countries, even though at a different stage depending on the country.
Based on the knowledge received from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units will have to increase their preparedness for the rapid growth of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare and especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a rare pneumonia case related to an unknown disease theory was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the novel coronavirus as a functional ingredient is now being referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Therefore, the illness was named after the SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, there is evidence that 80% of people infected with COVID-19 are mild, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 becomes a more serious disease that creates a need for hospitalization, while 6% of the infected suffer from serious illnesses that require intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we are reviewing the trends in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the UK's (UK) COVID-19 sequenced cases and comparing them with China's Hubei province.
We also compare Italy's numbers between January 31 and March 15 to the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
China's backward COVID-19 spreads more geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows the country.
The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spitchery and her partners reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO's case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases of people returning from Wuhan in Hubei province were reported by France on January 24, 2020.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 was detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the UK (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported from December 31, 2019, while Italy alone reported 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
The number of COVID-19 cases and the number of reported cases
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reports on the number of COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide, derived from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, which are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare what happened in Italy.
As a proxy for the outbreak of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day short-enhanced cases of COVID-19, thus considering the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during January 1 - March 15, 2020.
We have also presented the cumulative number of reported cases in each country up to 8:00 am on 15th March 2020 and compared them to cases in Italy during 31st January-15th March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of short-lived COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and in the UK followed the trend of Hubei Province (China) in general (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative cases of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21 and then grew sharply around February 28, 2020.
It was mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown a similar growth trend in cases of COVID-19 (compared materials).
Figure 2 shows a comparison of Italy's numbers with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK for the period January 31–March 15, 2020.
As of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have already reported a comparable total of Italy's cases in just 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of known cases of COVID-19 is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend noted in the number of cases of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is moving at a comparative pace in all countries.
This is despite countries having different levels of national public health responses, and despite different definitions of likely cases in countries and different protocols for selecting patients that must be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in infected areas in Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with COVID-19 need intensive care, and media sources said hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or an intensive care unit is currently only available in 6% and 1% of cases at the EU/EEA level, respectively (the data has not been shown).
However, these should be systematically collected to supplement the current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 in the format of 4.2 beds per 100,000 population of Portugal from 29.2 in Germany showed a major difference between the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe.
This means countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy ( 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
With the prevalence of COVID-19 cases being admitted to hospitals in each EU/EEA country and the UK, modelling conditions related to healthcare affordability have shown that there is a <0x3E>90% risk of impairing the capacity of an intensive care bed and is provided in the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment of COVID-19 by the ECDC.
Since the events are so far in EU/EEA countries and in some areas of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically provide a specific regional service to the user population, it is advisable to obtain information on the affected and intensive care beds in the manner of naming the regional units for the 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is making rapid progress in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, the ongoing community transmission situation of SARS-CoV-2 in the country, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, such as those in the affected regions of Italy, and the need for healthcare and especially intensive care.
As indicated in recent ECDC rapid risk assessments, a rapid, pre-operative and holistic approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with changes in the mode of mitigation from suppression, since if not implemented ahead of time, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not be sufficient for the decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and respond to them.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity that countries have the potential to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
If it fails to do so, there is a possibility that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients in need of intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
More than 3,000 people have died in China and the rest of the world due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2), and more than 80,000 people have been infected, bringing a catastrophe to humanity.
SARS-CoV is similar to its homogeneous virus, which in 2003 caused SARS among thousands of people, SARS-CoV-2 may also be infected with bats and cause the same symptoms through the same method.
However, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 is lower than that of SARS but it is much more contagious and affects older men and women than young people.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the topic of rapidly developing research.
We will include primary topics about epidemiology of the disease, epidemiology, virology, disease diagnosis, treatment, disease motion indicators, and prevention.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the dreaded disease.
The spring festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people, who were asked to stay indoors for the entire holiday and still for several weeks due to the outbreak of a new virus outbreak.
The virus is highly homogeneous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and its associated disease was named COVID-19.
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to more than 50 countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 due to the virus, of which more than 40,000 have been released and more than 3,000 patients have died.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is ""the number one enemy of the people"" and probably more powerful than terrorism."
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 articles on COVID-19, including virus, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment, have been published in less than two months from the first reporting on January 7, 2020, which has determined the sequence of viruses isolated from multiple patients.
This review attempts to summarize the progress of research in new and fast-growing topics.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-caused disease, with respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS, 2012).
We also discussed what we have learned so far about disease prevention and forecasting, and some of the remaining but urgent issues with it.
CoVs are traditionally thought to be pathogens that are not deadly to humans, causing about 15% of the 4 common colds.
However, in this century, we have faced two high pathogenic human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which began a pandemic outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to many other countries with severe symptoms and mortality.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third COVID outbreak recorded in human history.
As shown in Figure 1, the sources of pneumonia clusters that were unknown were first reported from Wuhan to the China National Health Commission on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the covid vaccine was released.
Wuhan's first fatality was reported on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, healthcare providers were informed about the infection, which indicated that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was shut down and all public transport was shut down.
The first clinical study on the disease on January 24 said that out of 41 confirmed patients, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood (seafood) market, considered to be the starting point of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the time of this report, the disease has already spread to about 50 other countries in China and around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation rapidly escalates, the final magnitude and intensity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centre study on 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases presented a more updated picture of the pandemic (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but is mainly seen in the 30-65 age group.
About half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The spread of COVID-19 spreads mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of COVID-19 to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the onset of the disease to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The initial reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the coordinate R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly before January 23, 2020, in line with the period of widespread transport before the Spring Festival of China.
The confirmed cases had a mortality rate of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the cumulative mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subset of large and contagious viruses that contain a single formula of the sensor RNA.
They can be divided into four categories, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, in which alpha- and beta-CoVs infect humans.
Glycoprotein (S) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, binds to its cellular customer angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidial peptide 4 (DPP4), and then the membrane is added.
The viral RNA is released into the genome cytoplasm; after the replicating of the viral genome, the genomic RNA with glycoprotein and nucleocapsidad proteins forms viscous or fungi, which then mixes with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first genomic case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% of the 10 calibrated samples collected from the Wuhan marine food market.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV-2 than MES-CoV.
Through the emission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the extremity of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
It was reported that human ACE2 was a receptor in the case of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are bound to human ACE2, relatively weaker than SARS-CoV, which is concluded in the case of actual cases that lead to less severe infections in SARS-CoV-2 patients than SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 is an innovative small protein encoded by orf3b and can also form proteins encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b may play a role in the ability to cause viral diseases and inhibit the release of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional fields or molds.
Zhou and others reported the full-length human ACE2's cryo-EM structure in a 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> resolution in mixed material, including the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the mixed element with open and closed orientation was combined as a diamer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixed element could bind two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and transmission of CoV.
For the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection, B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug testing.
Primary and Middle-Earth
It has been reported that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and have been transmitted to humans through cevet cats and camels, respectively.
By comparing a physique of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered to be the natural prey of SARS-CoV-2 because of the new virus with the equivalent of two SARS-CoV-CoV<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21 bats.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate insect virus helped to overcome the barrier of the species to infect humans and the path of transmission remains to be explained in detail.
Ji and others who presented the snake as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans involved in the recombination of homologous in S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that there was a possible intermediate pathogen of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of the genetic homology found in the most often long sputum pangolins used in traditional Chinese medicine, petrochemical mammals - SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is still a big difference; that's why the conclusions are still waiting for a very solid proof (Figure.33).
The biochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a dry environment for up to 48 hours and at a temperature of 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and at 40%-50% humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes in ultraviolet rays and heat; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, parasitic acids, chloroform and other fatty solvents can effectively neutralize the virus.
The entire human race generally lacks the immune system of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore they are at risk of being infected with the novel virus.
There is currently no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only look at previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Usually, after entering a virus pet, it is first identified by the instinctive immune system of the pet through the receptors of the pattern marking. These receptors include receptors such as C-type lactin, receptors like toll-like receptors (TLRs), receptors like NODs, and receptors such as RI.
Through various pathways, the virus induces the release of inflammatory substances, the maturity of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the transmission of the virus and accelerate the macrophages of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help protect the virus from immune system reactions.
Soon, the useful immune response also joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T cells, play an important role in preventing T lymphocytes.
CD4<0x2B>T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8<0x2B>T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
T-Helpar cells produce proinflammatory cytokine to help prevent cells.
However, CoV T can inhibit the function of T cells by inducing death of cells.
The body's immune system, including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, isolated antibodies from recovered patients prevent MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive sensitivity to the immune system locally creates a large number of free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multi-legged disabilities can even lead to death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by skeletal infarction, is more likely to cause harm to older people and pregnant women with pre-existing conditions.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or those with weakened immunity are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the research of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days.
However, studies on 1,099 cases have shown that the disease was on average 3 days incubation and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
According to the above description, a recent study showed that the ovarian ovaries had a duration of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days, based on the population of 8,866 cases.
Adjusting the effective quarantine period based on the incubation period of the most accurate pathogens is very important for health authorities, thus preventing the transmission of the virus from infected but symptomless people to others.
As a common practice, people infected or exposed to the virus usually need to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Is it necessary to extend the quarantine period to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and primary symptom of COVID-19, with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, drowsiness, headache, sore throat, rhinoria, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
A week after the onset of the disease, some patients felt dyspnea (shortness of breath) and/or hypoxemia.
In severe cases, patients develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and cotopath.
Symptoms of fever and/or shortness of breath and even pulmonary imaging are not uncommon, the virus needs to be tested in early diagnosis.
In late December 2019, a demographic study found that 98% of the percentage of symptoms had fever, 76% had dry cough, 55% had diarrhoea, and 3% had diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Two recent studies of a class of seizures (family clusters) and a cluster caused by an infection from a person with no symptoms reported similar discoveries.
Comparatively, a demographic study in 2012 found that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, which is much higher than COVID-19 patients and is consistent with higher mortality rates of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients it was shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40-22%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat pain (13)-25%) were the main symptoms and about 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
By February 14, the global COVID-19 death rate was 2%, while confirmed cases reached 66,576.
By comparison, SARS had a mortality rate as of November 2002, accounting for 10 percent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the death rate based on a demographic survey in June 2012 was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that 95% of SARS-CoV-2 with Confide Interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 was higher than the R0 6.47 of SARS-CoV-2, where the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The numbers above indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infections are more likely to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but are less deadly than the other two.
It is therefore more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The disease often begins in the same family or in vehicles like the same assembly or sea ship.
Patients often have a history of exposure to individuals or patients who have been traveling or living or experiencing symptoms in Wuhan or other infected places over the past two weeks.
However, reports have found that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients recovering from hospitalizations can carry the virus again, sending a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the early stages, the number of white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the edges of the patient is normal or low.
For example, in 1,099 COVID-19 patients, the number of white blood cells with lymphocyte numbers <0x3C>1 <0xC3><0x97> 109/L, including viscosity <0x3C>4 <0xC3><0x97> 109/L, and aspartame aminotransferase levels and viremia, including the number of lymphocytes in L4/L.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and pessimistic stimulants and myoglobin in the blood, and most of the patients' blood had increased c-reactive proteins and arrhythrocytes.
In severe cases, levels of D-dimer, which is a fibrin corrosive product present in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes decreased.
The abnormality of chest radiography is found in most COVID-19 patients and is characterized by the opacity of two-sided uneven shadows or abrasive glass in the lungs.
Patients often experience symptomatic pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid regeneration, and progressive fibrosis seriously endanger the gas exchange.
The abnormal action of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces surfactant levels and increases surface-tight, thereby reducing the ability to stretch the lungs and increasing the risk of weakening the lungs.
Therefore, the worst type of chest radiographic searches are often seen in the case of the most severe outbreak of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the dissociation of pneumocytes, the formation of haylin membrane, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and the multinucleated synaptic cells in the lungs of the deceased, with viral infections and pathologies of the ARDS.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA identification through reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main measure of COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the extremely wrong-negative rate, which can accelerate the pandemic, clinical or clinical manifestations begin to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR) in China from February 13, 2020.
The same applies to the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the link between the history of the disease, diagnostic displays, laboratory tests and radiological investigations is essential and necessary to determine effective diseases.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhong Group described a protocol for the use of CRISPR-based Sherlock (SHERLOCK) technique to determine SARS-CoV-2, which defines the fraction of 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 100 mol/L-A copy of SAR-2 in less than an hour without the need for extended materials.
The new technique is expected to dramatically increase sensitivity and usefulness if clinical samples are verified.
Doctors can provide mainly supportive sputum to COVID-19 patients, as well as other CoV-related diseases such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other virus-related diseases (Section 2).
This therapy includes antiviral drugs, suppressing immune response, steroids, plasma in patients receiving treatment, Chinese medicine and psychological support current and potential treatments.
It has even been suggested to use plasma from patients who have been cured for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and also probably attacks other organs at a low level that reveal ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Yet, respiratory inactivity and disability are the main threats and causes of death in patients.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and saves lives, and this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, ventilation that does not have to be cut, and mechanical ventilation that has to be cut depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiopulmonary bypass technology, which is used to treat fatal cardiac or respiratory disorders.
It is also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients to balance electrolytes, prevent and treat indirect infections and septic shocks, and protect vital organs.
It has been reported that cytokine disasters result from excessive reactions of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine catastrophe is a form of inflammatory response that occurs through the release of cytokine classes including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines release a large number of free radicals through immune cells, which are the main causes of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Resistance to the treatment of cytokine disaster is essential, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, have been used to treat cytokine catastrophes.
Other immune response suppressive treatments for cytokine disasters include T cell-directed immune response correction; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF inhibition; JAK mitigation; Blinatomob; cytokine signaling 4-repressive; and HDAC suppression.
To reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS.
However, high-drug steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially Avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the possibility of healing.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids in low to medium doses are advised to be used discreetly for severely ill COVID-19 patients.
No effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed at the time of writing.
However, intermittent application, including remdesivir, nucleotide analogues, has been proven to be effective for a U.S. patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug that was initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlberg viruses.
Later, other single-source RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses, have also shown possible resistance to remdesivir.
Based on this, Gilad has provided this compound to China to conduct a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and the results are highly anticipated.
Barricitinb, Interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, Lopinavir/Retonavir and Ribavirin have been recommended as possible therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after therapy combined with lopinavir/retonavir.
The interaction of this treatment with other drugs used in patients needs to be carefully observed.
Plasma and antibody production from recovered patients
There is a long history of blood collection from patients recovering from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from falling on the edge of the disease.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in terms of pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight germs and other external objects, and they identify distinct molecules of pathogens and directly dilute them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and with it, the inflammation and viral load decreased and the involvement of oxygen in the blood improved.
However, specific therapies have not yet developed and verification and clarification are necessary to propose a method for use in large scale before it.
Also, in terms of medical effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and there is a huge demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce antibodies quickly at certain stages in the fight against the global pandemic.
Thus, it is more important and effective to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes to monitor or encode effective antibodies against the necessary proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects depend on the combination of multiple elements in a formula in large quantities that vary depending on the diagnosis based on the TCM-theory.
Most effective ingredients are unknown or unclear, since it is difficult to extract and verify such elements or their optimal combinations.
Currently, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, it was reported that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lean Hua Qing Wen capsules were effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
In many states in China, TCM has been used to treat COVID-19 patients where the highest rate of recovery has been found, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningjia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, where TCM was used for only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, it had the lowest (13 percent).
However, this is quite a gross comparison because many other influencers such as the number and severity of the patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing WM and TCM combined treatments with Western Medicine (WM).
They found that the body temperature was significantly lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group only when needed to return to normal, relieve symptoms, and hospitalization.
Most interestingly, the shortfall rate (light to severe) was significantly lower than the WM team only (7.4% vs 46.2%) in the WM<0x2B>TCM team and the death rate was lower than the WM team only (8.8% versus 39%).
Despite this, TCM's effectiveness and safety are waiting for greater levels and more systematic testing in more centers.
It will also be interesting to identify the work process and, if possible, clarify the effective ingredients or combinations of TCM treatments.
Most of those infected with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 feel extremely contagious and even fear of deadly diseases, and people in quarantine also experience loneliness, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, cough and adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to further anxiety and stress.
In the early stages of the outbreak of SARS, a variety of psychiatry symptoms were reported, including long-term depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excretion, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies.
As part of the public health response to the outbreak of COVID-19, compulsive contact tracing and quarantine can create more anxiety and guilt about the impact of infection, quarantine and stigmatization on their family and friends.
Thus, mental health services should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and individuals who have come into contact with them as well as to the general public who need them.
Psychological support should include the formation of mental health teams from multiple disciplines of medical science, regular and accurate updates on the outbreak and medical plans of SARS-CoV-2, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to prevent the chain of transmission of sensitive pets from animal reservoirs and infected people, and are often supplemented by antiviral treatments to control the epidemic caused by the virus.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to create long-term and strong resistant antibodies against SARS-CoV and/or to create protective immunity.
Live-attendated vaccines have been tested in animal models of SARS.
But before starting a medical study, in older people and in the lethal-challenge model, the efficacy of these immunized candidates and their protection against virus transmission from animal sources to humans have not yet been determined.
This is probably because SARS was destroyed 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
In contrast, scattered events and events in the Middle East of the MERS membrane continue and spread to other regions due to the existence of zootic sources in the diseased area.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plusmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-infectious people is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome this difficulty due to the need for a long time (for 18 months) for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic changes in the CoV-supply.
As a novel disease, the entire clinical course of COVID-19 is just beginning to be fully developed for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without prior illness.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with much higher illness and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is essential for health-care agencies to create a rewarding model of the disease to prioritise their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies so far reported, the following factors may or may be associated with COVID-19 patients regarding the speed indicator of the disease (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the outcome of SARS' disease, which is also true for COVID-19.
In the study of 8,866 cases described above, 47.7% of those patients who were above 50 were diagnosed with COVID-19, mainly in the age group of 30-65.
Patients who needed intensive care were at the same time more likely to have other diseases and complications and were significantly older than others (65 years of middle age versus 51 years of age) indicating age as a sign of the disease's speed indicator for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: Male SARS-CoV-2 infections have been higher than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), which is described above.
The existence and complexity of multiple diseases: Patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from severe heart attacks and arrhythmia.
Also cardiac events were the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive collages, resulting in faulty liver function in COVID-19 patients.
It should be remembered that age and underlying diseases are strongly related and can interfere with each other.
Unusual information found in the laboratory: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or injury to the tissue, and have been proposed as indicators of possible disease speed for disease, therapy response and final healing.
It was also proposed to reciprocate the severity and forecast of COVID-19 with the CRP level.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the consequences.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and emitted during cell damage.
Thus, they are the traditional markers for the heart or liver dysfunction.
Major diagnostic symptoms: To predict the complications and consequences of COVID-19, along with other problems, the periodic progression of chest radiography and diagnostic symptoms must be considered.
Steroid use: As described above, in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an accessory treatment for infectious diseases.
Since high drug levels of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many of the respondents were suffering from Avascal's osteonecrosis with long-term disability and low standard of living.
So, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for short periods of time in case of COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: According to what has been described above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients often experienced long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and experienced abnormal stress when they saw close family members and patients dying in the face of death.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these patients get rid of stress and return to normal life.
So far, according to demographic studies, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 seem to be different from SARS.
In addition to making copies of the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms at the initial stage of infection, similar to other CoVs responsible for common colds.
Thus, by causing great difficulty in controlling the pandemic, patients suffering from early stage or pathogens can produce a large amount of viruses during day-to-day work.
However, SARS-CoV infection was thought to occur when patients became seriously ill, when most infections did not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
China is currently making great efforts, including lockdowns in Wuhan and neighboring cities in the hope of preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 disease, and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population.
Although these measures have caused dramatic damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which indicates the slower pace of the pandemic.
The most promising estimate is that the outbreak of the disease will end in March and the downward phase of the disease will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others speculated that COVID-19, which is proving to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others set up a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinet and throat-received salivas in patients who recovered and left the hospital two weeks ago, indicating that the newly identified virus would become a cyclical phase similar to influenza.
However, there are optimistic indications in China based on the falling number of new cases, which indicates that current strategies may be working.
It was initially predicted that Ebola would cause one million cases, including half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been kept under control.
It is also possible that just like SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 can become vulnerable to infections and eventually become extinct or become a relatively less contagious virus in co-operation with humans.
The comparison between SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 pandemic is below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible through cough or sneezing and possibly by direct contact with the material contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the moustache, which highlights the new possibility of an infection from the mucus to the mucous membrane.
A recent study on 138 cases found that 41% of the cases were likely caused by a nosocomial infection, including 17 patients with other pre-existing diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Thus, adequate precautions must be taken to protect people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even those close to patients or affected people.
Wearing masks can be used as the first stage of defense to reduce the risk of infection; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiration masks (Series <0x23>1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent small droplets of liquid from a potentially infected person from spreading through the air or trapped on the surface of the object, from which they could be spread to others.
However, only N95 (Series <0x23> 1860s) masks can protect against small virions such as 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of the virions are able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 size is equal to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can even enter through five successive surgical masks, healthcare providers who come into direct contact with patients must wear a surgical mask, not an N95 (Series <0x23>1860s).
In addition to masks for health care providers to further reduce contact with the virus, measurements should also be worn in isolation gowns.
The virus can also infect individuals through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus probably entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face coverings or goggles when patients are working.
In the case of the public in affected or potentially affected areas, everyone is advised to wash their hands with more frequent disinfectant soap than usual, try to stay indoors to quarantine themselves, and limit exposure to potentially infected individuals.
The distance of three feet is considered suitable for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective in reducing the risk of infection as well as preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus in the human world, China should have taken a high alert based on the deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak due to its high similarity with SARS-CoV, according to a January 7, 2020 report.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the director of Wuhan's Centers for Disease Control reassured the citizens that the novel virus is less contagious and limited in reproductive capacity from humans to humans, and that there is no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
The message relaxed the public's fear significantly, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival and Wuhan was wasting significant time suppressing the disease at a minimum level.
China's disease control agencies can take this rigorous education and make essential improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations must be more careful when making public declarations (1) because every word citizens will consider and it can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) doctors or officials should be more sensitive and responsive to unwarranted feedback from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports; (3) the public should be aware of the need to be more proactive and proactive in the early stages of testing to prevent possible epidemics; and (4) the epidemics.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread across China and it spread to more than 50 countries around the world at the time of writing this report.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are also in the middle, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a feeling like the return of SARS.
However, there are some noticeable differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary to curb the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even in unmarked conditions, while SARS patients usually do so in a serious illness, making it much more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more massively than SARS-CoV-2.
Regular RNA evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who are recovering can again be positive in terms of the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Considering such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of important issues remain to be resolved:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology has been found in SARS-CoV-2 and two bats, we still can't come to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the main host, such as bats to humans?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we will not be able to effectively reduce the spread of the infection and the outbreak may return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assessments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respirator cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also block ACE2-expressing cells of other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we will not be able to get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How the virus is genetically transmitted to humans?
Is it going to be a global pandemic, a death like SARS, or a recurrence of flu-like outbreaks at some point in time?
This is essential, but it takes some time to find the answers to the above and many more questions.
But no matter the price it claims, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and take our lives back to normal.
The source of human coronaviruses
Transformation and adaptation have driven the co- evolution of the coronavirus (CoV) and its offspring, including mankind, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as common colds.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown its upside to the currency to reveal how devastating and lethal the HCoV infection can be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought CoVs back to the top of the discussion and surprised us by showing a higher transmission capacity and low pathogenicity than our sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal-borne disease and can help us understand the zoonotic source of HCoVs.
Most of the bats have emerged from HCoVs where they are less diseased.
Some of the HCoVs have also been identified as an aadhar shelter.
The identification of animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Researching the exchange of CoVs in animals can also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we are giving a brief overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, centering on their discovery history as well as their animal origins and interconnected transmissions.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the point of view of virus evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, the current COVID-19 pandemic has been discussed.
In addition, the need for successful shelter change and the effects of the virus' evolution in the severity of the disease are also noticeable.
The coronavirus (CoV-symptoms) belongs to the family of coronavirus, containing a group of, positive-sensitized, single-stranded RNA viruses.
"These viruses sheltered the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilograms of RNA viruses were called ""CoVs"" due to crown-national organelles under the electron microscope."
Structurally, CoV-symbols have an integral genome that belongs to the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, which have been named nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for constructive proteins, including worms (S), wraps (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Some lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), most of which contain HCoVs in beta-CoVs and are divided into four genera (A, B, C, and D).
Genetic evidence has shown that bats and rats serve as gene sources for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the mainstays of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently exceeded interspecies barriers and emerged as some of the main human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Civic Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common colds and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly detected SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing acute respiratory infection symptoms (Acuate Respiratory Disorder Syndrome, ARDS) and acute low respiratory tract infections in more patients with a higher likelihood of exposure to the outside of the lungs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was collected from the nose discharge of patients with common colds in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, the idea was widely accepted that the transmission of HCoVs is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating cases in recent history, infecting 8,000 people and the unaccounted mortality rate was about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East's respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak led to the pandemic on the Arabian Peninsula and spread to the rest of the world.
2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the functional agent of the current coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in the death of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm clock is ticking and the world needs to be prepared for the upcoming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
Each of the seven HCoVs has animal sources from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary source of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-communicable but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
The discovery of animal sources of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the causes of the limitation of natural history, driving force, and moving from species to species.
With issues that are important in preventing future spillover, it can guide or manage the search for SARS-CoV-2's Aadhaar, intermediate and amplifier animal shelter(s).
In this review, we are presenting a summary of the animal source of HCoVs, inter-ethnic infections and pathologies.
In particular, we want to make this general context visible to everyone and discuss that HCoV-like parenting viruses are usually harmless in their natural Aadhaar shelters, but are pathogenic after the new host enters the body.
We also review the trend of evolution of HCoVs where as transmissibility increases, often the pathogenesis decreases.
The results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have also been discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Various CoV-infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs, were collected before the first collection of the B814 of the HCoV-229E strain from the nose discharge of patients with common cold.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Section 1) will be informative and educational.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to increase the line of the WI-38 lung cell.
Infected patients with HCoV-229E showed common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, feeling ill, and sore throat, and fever and cough in 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was collected from the recurrent growth of the virus in the brains of the Organ culture and later the dairy rats.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to the symptoms caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be symptomaticly distinguished from the transmission of other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are mainly infected in winter climates worldwide and in the maturing season.
Usually, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
A human volunteer study found that healthy people with HCoV-229E developed mild common colds.
Only a few patients with immunity were diagnosed with severe low respiratory tract infection.
"SARS, also known as ""Atypical Pneumonia"", was the first well-documented HCoV-borne epidemic in human history and its causal representative was SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV."
The first case of SARS was found in late 2002 in Guangdong province of China.
The SARS pandemic has reported 8,096 cases across many countries and continents, of which 774 have died.
In addition to super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and appearing on the 10th day of illness could increase the final symptoms of viral load as well as about two auxiliary cases.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially appear as delayed symptoms of muscle cramps, headache, fever, discomfort, and shortness of breath, cough and shortness of breath after colds.
Lymphopenia, deformed liver function tests, and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
In patients with SARS, the loss of dispersed alveolar, the spread of subcellular cells, and the growth of macrophages are also observed.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation at a later stage.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can be infected in severe cases, usually with cytokine catastrophes that can be fatal, especially in patients with immune system disorders.
An index traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong was first collected from a relative's open lung biopsy.
Since then, a lot of efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was collected from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was initially common among young children, elderly and respiratoryly ill patients whose immunity was low.
Common diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 in chrysanthemums, eyesight, fever and bronchitis.
Another independent study described the collection of the same virus from an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It has been estimated that about 4.7% of the common respiratory diseases of HCoV-NL63 are identified as the cause of the disease and are most commonly reported in the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was collected from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia and bronchiolysis in Hong Kong.
In addition to group-oriented pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All of these four grouped HCoVs are well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to be converted to cause high pathogenic diseases, although accidents occurred due to unknown causes, such as the rare occurrence of extremely harmful sub-types of HCoV-NL63 that have recently been reported to have severe infections of low respiratory tract infections in China.
Usually, when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves in humans, they also become relatively less harmful or contagious.
In 2012, MERS-CoV was first collected from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had severe pneumonia and regenerative failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the laboratory-confirmed cases have emerged from the Middle East, there have been reports of cases coming from outside, including a second phased spread, in close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, a second phased outbreak in South Korea found 186 confirmed cases.
Characterized by progressive acute pneumonia, the clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also had severe renal dysfunction, which is the only one among HCoV-borne diseases to date.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of abdominal diseases such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 labs have confirmed that more than 34.4% of deaths have occurred, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses for the human body.
From mid-December 2019 to late-end, classes of pneumonia-infected patients were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, as they were traditionally associated with cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the ongoing outbreak of low respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, with a roughly 3.4% mortality rate, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide.
Notably, the fatality rate for Hubei in China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea can also be seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious signs and acute respiratory distress syndromes that can progress quickly.
Although 82% are very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to high nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster in different branches of race trees.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be relatively less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported as a symptomless case and may play a role in its rapid spread around the world.
Comparisons and comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal a lot of interest.
First of all, the period of ovarian entropy and the duration of the course of the HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 comes in the middle of four HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are commonly seen during community-acquired HCoV-associated infections, including non-specific, mild, or even symptomless presentations.
On the other hand, even a small fraction of severe cases of COVID-19 show symptoms of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting characteristic patterns of both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs acquired by the infection group.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are at least as high as group-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, such as in humans, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passage.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in samples of moles.
At least in some circumstances, it remains to be clarified by future studies whether SARS-CoV-2's epilepsy plays an important role in cases such as SARS-CoV.
It's especially interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2, like community-acquired HCoVs, exhibits season-dependentness.
Nevertheless, its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including sustainable spread, will be influential in the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
All four groups of mild-mannered HCoVs have been well-suited to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that people have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be the answer to the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in people and people who have developed severe HCoVs have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCoVs need to be replicated in humans in sufficient quantities to contain adaptive expressions that fight against the causes of hostilities limitations.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is and the more people are infected, the more likely it will be to fully adapt to people.
If it is well-adjusted, it will be difficult for the human body to stop its infection by quarantine or other measures of infection control.
For many years, four group-affiliated CoVs have been spreading to human populations, and the emergence of common colds among patients with general immunity.
These viruses do not require any animal Aadhaar.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted in humans and cannot sustain their transmission in humans.
These are required to be maintained and expanded in zoonotic bases, and perhaps find an opportunity to spread through one or more intermediate and amplifiers to a viable human target.
SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least so far, it's highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than group-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it fully adapts to humans and continues to spread among humans without any Aadhaar or intermediate animal grooming.
Before discussing the animal source of HCoVs, we will benefit from discussing the definitions and characteristics of HCoV-environmental, natural, Aadhaar, intermediate, and amplified shelters.
An animal acts as an evolutionary pet of HCoV if it shelters a close relative predisposition by sharing higher homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The paternal virus usually adapts well to this host's body and is non-pregnant.
Similarly, an Aadhaar shelter provides HCoVs with continuous and long-term shelters.
In both cases, shelterers are naturally infected and are natural hosts of HCoVs or its parent viruses.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host before or just around humans, it does not fit well with the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human transmission, and can then play a role as an amplifier host in amplifying the level of human transmission through transfusions in the human body.
If HCoVs can't keep up with the infection in the intermediate host, the infection can be prevented.
In contrast, HCoVs can also be adapted to the intermediate host and can start a long-term lesion.
In this case, the intermediate wearer becomes the pet of natural Aadhaar.
The epidemiological data revealed in the event tradition that the SARS index had a history of contact with hunting animals.
The subsequent seroprevalence findings indicated that anti-SARS-CoV IgG outbreaks were higher among animal traders than the general public.
A raccoon dog was first identified to carry a virus such as SARS-CoV, which was almost similar to SARS-CoV, in the markets of the slang (paguma larvata) and live animals.
It was indirectly supported by this information that no further cases of SARS were reported after killing all smog in the markets.
However, it has been reported that the masked palm savours of wild or farms without exposure to the live animal market were largely negative for SARS CoV, indicating that masked palm odours would only serve as intermediate amplifier shelters, but not as a natural basis for SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the Guangzhou market has anti-SARS-CoV antibodies to various types of animals, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals can also act as an intermediate amplifier of SARS-CoV is not excluded.
All of these are considered to be one-of-a-kind carriers of SARS-CoV.
The next discovery of the natural animal breed of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, the SARS-related rhinolofoss bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists on the Chinese hershu bat, which is called the HKU3. The next search has revealed a closely related bat CoV, the SARS-cap
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% of nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for new ideas that bats provide shelter to emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs have been identified from bats, but none other than a designated WIV1 can be collected as a live virus.
Human angiotensin converter enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the customer of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from samples of bat stools appeared to be used as a receptor for penetration into cells such as bats, civets, and human ACE2.
Curiously, serums in patients with SARS who are recovering were able to disable WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares 95% of nucleotide sequence homology.
Although these two viruses have high levels of homology, it is generally believed that WIV1 SARS-CoV is not an immediate parental virus, and bats are not an immediate supporter of SARS-CoV.
Physiological analyses classify MERS-CoV into the same category as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat uses the same host receptor, diptyidyl peptides 4 (DPP4) to enter the CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV virus.
The RNA polymerase sequences of RNA-dependent MERS-CoV are phylogeneticly close to replicas of bat beta-CoVs detected from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be an immediate adjunct to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have found that one kneaded camels are sterile for MERS-CoV specific mitochondrial antibodies, just like the middle east source camels in multiple African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was collected from the nose swab of a kneaded camel, which further suggests that the camel acts as the actual Aadhaar nurse of MERS-CoV.
It's also worth noting that camels tested by MERS-CoV usually have mild symptoms, although a lot of viruses have been observed to cause (virus shading).
Notably, infected camels not only spread the virus through the respiratory system, but also through the anus-oral pathway, which is also the main way to spread the virus from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS did not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, possibly from human to human transmission or from an unknown animal species that sheltered MERS-CoV of the infection path.
The bat collected from the rhinolophosphate affinities bat has a 96.2% similarity with SARS-CoV-2's nucleotide homology of CoV RaTG13.
In the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as in the case of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, the sequence divergence is also too high for determining parental relationships.
This means, if almost identical bat CoVs are not available in the future, bats may not be a direct aadhar dress(s) of SARS-CoV-2.
Probably, animal shelters between SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild animals sold and killed in the Huanan Seafood wholesale market, with the initial number of cases related to COVID-19, indicating a possible animal-to-human transmission case.
Several recent studies based on metogenic sequencing suggest that a team of endangered small mammals known as Banrui (Manis Javanica) may also carry terrestrial beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
This novel is a replica of 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology SARS-CoV-2 of the Banrui CoV genomes.
However, with about 90% uniformity at the level of nucleotide sequence, they are equally associated with RaTG13.
They bind to two sub-species of viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, in an ethnic tree, which shares the same receptor binding domain (RBD) with a 97.4% amino acid sequence identity with one SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are further decomposed, although the sequence homology genome-wide higher degrees.
A previous study on sick monkeys also reported the detection of virus-related sequences from lung samples, which have been proven to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various assembly methods and manual presentations to create partial genome sequences with approximately 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that Pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct forestry source of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequencing between SARS-CoV-2 and Banrui SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-related variants.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is much lower than that of beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 and Banroui SARS-CoV-2.
The path of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
Although most sequence homology between SARS-CoV-2 and Banruy's RBD has been found, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share most genome-following sequence homology.
It is extremely far-fetched that the high resemblance between the beta-CoVs associated with the RBD of the Banarai SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective-mediated orbital evolution.
One of the third wild animal species to propose a counterbalance is in favor of a recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13.
As the driving force in evolution, the reconnection between beta-CoVs is widened.
The exact source of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
In addition to high pathogenic HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Physiological evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were derived from bat CoVs, although parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rats.
It has been reported that a bat CoV, called ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV), identified in North America's three-horned bats with HCoV-NL63, showed a close relationship.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hippocideros/Ghanakowam/19/2008, although comedians have also been suspected as its intermediate host.
For clarity, the animal source of the known HCoV is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnic analysis has provided evidence of inter-species infectious events of CoV-symptoms in history.
In the 1890s, when HCoV-OC43 infected humans from domesticated animals, there was an epidemic of shortness of breath.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is relatively less clear.
Alpha-CoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
One of them is Alpaca-Alpha CoV.
Several evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, the shared ecological environment may be from the contact of bats with humans but not with alpacas.
Instead, people have close contact with the alpaca.
Second, the HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoV-associated bats are diverse and non-hazardous in bats, while alpha-CoVs cause an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that the alpha-CoV related to HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, bats act as a gene pool of the alpha-CoV-229E, but alpaca and one bald camel can serve as intermediate shelters that transmit the virus to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as a great example of the spread of interspecies transmission from bats to bats and from a swab camel to humans.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV from bats is known in early detection and is further strengthened by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich base of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragment and interspecies transmission.
Long life, throbbingly full colonies, close social exchanges, and strong flying skills are favorable conditions for bats to become the ideal 'virus spreaders'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has come into contact with a bald camel a few decades ago.
It fits well with these camels that have turned from an intermediate shelter to a stable and natural Aadhaar shelter.
MERS-CoV causes very mild diseases and maintains relatively low incidence rates among these animals.
Its scattered infection among humans is an accident and people remain the latest host of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV, it is different if pangolins play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly contagious among pangolins.
They may be the latest host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs similar to smog in the case of SARS-CoV.
Various possibilities of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 from inter-species animals to humans may or may have to be included in future studies.
First of all, bats can be the base host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share environmental niches with bats through jab or coal mining.
Second, monkeys can be one of the intermediate amplifier shelters where a SARS-CoV-2-related virus was newly introduced.
People are infected with the virus by cutting and eating meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domesticated animals, are unprotected in SARS-CoV-2.
A study of domestic and wild animals for antibodies has been confirmed.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that have contact with both bats and pangolins.
The origins of SARS-CoV-2 are still being explored.
In addition to a variety of animal shelters, the three main causes of viral side effects are also important in helping CoVs to overcome interracial barriers.
First, they have a relatively high per capita rate of RNA per capita.
"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the approximate calibration rate of CoV-supply can be considered ""medium"" to ""high"" depending on the stage of CoV adaptation of the navel vapour, and the average replacement rate <0x7E>10-4 replacement will be 2 sites per year."
CoV-symptoms have a proof-reading exorbitant exorbitant, which results in excessively high variability and weakness or even inability to survive.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remdesivir is known to form a CoV replication by emitting this exorbitant molecule and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most likely anti-SARS-CoV-2 components tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the rate of CoV-individual exposure is about a million times higher than that of their host.
In addition, the conversion rate is often higher when the CoV-symptoms can't cope well with the wearer.
Compared with SARS-CoV, the prevalence rate of SARS-CoV-2 is seemingly low, which is an indication of adapting more easily to humans.
It is likely that it has already adapted to another shelter close to the people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV, which fits well with a kneaded camel.
Theoretically, the possibility of SARS-CoV-2's genetic drift vaccine and antivirals to be quickly ineffective is extremely low.
Second, the large RNA genome of CoV uses additional flexibility in the genome expression for reconnection and reconnection, which increases the likelihood of evolution including interconnection, which is beneficial for the emergence of CoV-infectiousness when the situation becomes convenient.
It is supported by a lot of unique encoded open reading frames and protein functions at the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the genome.
"The third, CoV-type randomly and often alters the templates when transcripting RNA through a unique ""copy-choice"" process."
In the shelter that acts as a mixture pot, strand switching often occurs during CoV RNA transcription.
Higher homogeneous full-length and subgenome RNAs can reconnect to create new CoV-types.
Physiogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, and in animal CoV-types such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Reciprocity of viruses related to infection
In addition to the three viral elements described above, viral exchange with host receptors is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Among these, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as an ideal example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis between the collection of human and ophthalmologist SARS-CoV-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to adapt quickly to the expression of RBD of S protein among different hosts.
Typically, the S protein of a CoV interacts with the RBD cellular receptor and is strongly selected by the response of the host antibody.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD contains 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 piece that are bound to human ACE2 as well as its corsets for viral penetration.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, cevets, rats and raccoons, which can cause interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only the residues of 6 amino acids have been found to be different from those of the odorous viral isolators in humans and RBD, and 4 of them are located in customer-combinant design to interact with the ACE2 customer.
Civet SARS-CoV RBD contains K479N and S487T expressions, which can increase the quality of the exchange of spike protein with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be serious for virus-related adaptations in humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 are similar.
A 30% difference between the S1 unit of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the S1 unit of the SARS-CoV indicates that the tendency of its S protein binding to humans with ACE2 may change.
In fact, a cryo-EM study indicated a 10- to 20-fold higher bonding trend than what is trending between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also important to determine whether any other co-occurrence may be required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Worryingly, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are many more HCoV customers, such as 9-O-acetylted salicylic acid for aminotoptidase N and HCoV-OC43 for HCoV-229E.
They can also be considered as the cause of the successful adaptation of this CoV in humans after they are infected from their animal shelter.
In addition to cell receptors, the results of HCoV-like interspecies transmission are also governed by factors of dependence and limitations on other hosts.
The division of these host proteins between human and HCoV-like natural bases such as bats, a knob camel, and rats can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to take over the host dependency factors for a successful interspecies transmission and destroy the causes of hostilities.
In this case, it is yet to be identified and characterised in this important case of virus-assistant exchanges.
Using CRISPR's state-of-the-art technology, a neutral genome-wide screening of dependency and restrictions for SARS-CoV-2 may be effective.
The Rise of the Novel HCoV: Returning to Where It Started
The diversity of bat CoVs provides enough opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, the bat acts as a gene pool of the HCoV-symptoms.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, novel protein-coding genes have the ability to severely modify the acquired or lost viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been found to be important in treating people with SARS-CoV-related bat viruses, but they have been found to encode orf8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide removal feature of SARS-CoV-symptoms has been found in strains collected at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it seems to be an adaptive expression that encourages the shifting of shelter.
In addition, there is a history of possible recombination of SARS-CoV with groups of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of small recombination zones were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Reciprocating positions were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10 and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the pandemic MERS-CoV went through reconnection events among different groups, which occurred in the case of a kneaded camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, other HCoVs have been observed to have recombination events, where HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in genes that are not structural.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to undesirable changes in the viral genome, possibly as a result of the release of viruses from selection pressures such as the host immune system.
Examples of these effects are the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype formula due to the removal of bi-nucleotide.
Although axle ORF4 can be seen in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide placed inside, the result is seen in the frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by election pressure.
When bats were infected by CoV, they were symptomless or had only mild symptoms identified, indicating a mutual adaptation between the CoVs and bats.
It has been found that bats are well adapted to the genes and physiologically to the CoV-symptoms.
For example, the defects of reaction activation in favor of inflammation in bats effectively reduce pathology driven by CoV-symptoms.
In addition, repressive natural killer cell receptors NKG2/CD94 and main histomativity complex I class molecules have suppressed the activity of bat's natural killer cells.
In addition, both of these can suppress the replica of the high-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) CoV produced from the high metabolic activity of bats and affect proofreading by exorbitants, thus providing the required selection pressure for the virus strains to produce when in contact with a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also develop through re-infection, which leads to the acquisition of new protein or protein character for sheltering adaptations.
So, the possibility of the emergence of three new HCoVs in the last two decades is not coincidental.
CoV-symptoms cause mild symptoms in non-morbid or their Aadhaar shelters such as bats and camels.
They grow vigorously without the strong resistance of the host.
The secret of why a symptomless carrier is seen and what serious cases of human infection are occurring is contained in it.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to excessive activation of the immune response and cytokine stem where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage is.
In contrast, in the case of unmarked carriers, the resistance response is separated from the CoV counterpart.
The same technique of disconnecting the resistance response can have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon reaction is particularly strong in the bat.
Thus, the use of type I interferon should be beneficial in at least the first stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
Also, NLRP3 inflammatory activation defects in bats.
By this argument, NLRP3 inhibitors, including MCC950, may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common factors that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
On the one hand, a bat beta-CoV has been found that does 95% nucleotide homology exchange with SARS-CoV, while on the other, there is a bat-CoV that exchanges 96% of nucleotid homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although smog and other animals found on the market have sheltered viruses similar to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate shelters for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Strangely similar to SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be beta-CoV-like, indicating that the monkeys would act as one of the intermediate shelters or that the monkey could contribute to the gene fragment in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is either intentionally or accidentally caused by humans.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have returned to the center of discussion.
The study of CoV-symptoms in bats and other animals has significantly changed our perception of the importance of animal sources and animal aadhars in human transmission.
A wide range of evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat source and are transmitted to humans through the intermediate host.
Since the SARS-CoV infection stems from the contact between humans and the odours on the market, the killing of smelters there could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
Through the same logic, pangolins should be removed from the wet markets in order to prevent animal transmission in view of the discovery of multiple groups of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, future investigations are yet to clarify what exactly is and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted between humans through monkeys and other mammals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been present in one-knit camels.
These camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather, and wool for local people, in addition to important means of transport.
They are spread across the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done in China's wild animal market to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent repeated outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control systems.
If we are not able to eliminate these viruses, there may be an outbreak of new genotypes.
There are many types of animal CoVs that are spread in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs with animal potential are very rare.
These zoonotic CoVs have a lot of potential to grow and reconnect, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that will be more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some places in China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the fire test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a plan for better preparation and response.
Viruses have been around the world for a long time.
They remain on their own natural basis until they have the opportunity to spread.
Although bats have many features that are conducive to the spread of the virus, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are made aware to stay away from them.
In order to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural habitats, it is necessary to continuously monitor mammals, which will prove effective in preventing human infections and future outbreaks from animals.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal-borne disease in humans is to stay away from the environmental degradation of the natural base of the animal virus.
Several pieces of animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First of all, if bats transmit the parent virus of SARS-CoV-2 to the forestry, in what circumstances bats and monkeys can share the same environmental niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how people come into contact with bats should be determined.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate parent, it has to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domesticated animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infections should be performed.
Whether it's bats, pangolins or any other mammals, it's expected that SARS-CoV-2 or almost identical genetic viruses will be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
Continuous searches in this case will explain the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the "ideal" and "confirmed" diagnostic criteria for COVID-19.
On February 6, 2020, our team released a quick consultation guide for the detection and treatment of Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guide provided us with experience and made good reference to the fight against this pandemic worldwide.
However, our awareness and knowledge is also growing gradually, based on a new disease, ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we have responded to a comment on our instructions and provided a completely new diagnostic measure of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" according to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread, which has been officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been named Civic Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick consultation guide and it has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
Since its release, it has received a great response.
Keep in mind, COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is also growing gradually, based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued COVID-19 diagnostic and medical instructions (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, has published a total of seven editions, each of which has significantly changed some of the content.
Now that Zhou and his colleagues have made a comment about our instruction, they have suggested setting a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and also created valuable references to the pandemic around the world.
We are approving their remarkable work and thank you to us.
However, the most recent diagnosis and medical directives of COVID-19 (Trial VII) and their work will also need to be updated in the light of recent research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to ensure a suspected case, a detailed analysis must have two clinical symptoms with one of the epidemiological historical features, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, then three clinical symptoms must be met.
Epidemiological history: (1) residents of the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas or the history of travel there, or other communities where the history of COVID-19 cases has been reported in the last 14 days before the occurrence of symptoms; (2) a history of exposure to other cases of SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (positive to the nucleic acid test); (3) in the Wuhan city or surrounding areas.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total White Blood Cell Counts exhibit normal, reduced or reduced lymphocyte count at the stage of initial footing.
For the diagnosis of confirmed cases based on suspected cases, there should be a pathogenic or serological proof of any of the following stages of development of the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in the acute stage of the disease: (1) the SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is positive in the real-time PCR test of the patient; (2) the virus is detected in the full gene sequencing with the known novel coronavirus (3).
We have found that the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) versions include nucleic acid sequencer real-time PCR tests and blood samples in the respirator.
The pathogenic detection of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) edition; and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes, based on the continuing work of the researchers, are samples of the respiratory tract, including blood samples, to investigate a favorable nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, which increases the availability of different samples and which helps bring certain antibody positive results to the sure criteria.
Further, more evidence has been found, which reminds us to be wary of unregulated and non-pregnant patients.
Therefore, the flow list of Zhou and his companions should be updated, as they classify people who do not have clinical symptoms as "low-risk."
The score system also needs to be verified in subsequent clinical practice and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will come and readers will call for their comments.
In order to determine "ideas to have been infected" and "confirmed cases," we recommend identifying them and following the latest guidelines in our country.
Our team will be updated in a timely manner to help.
Bangladesh has reported five new deaths daily due to COVID-19.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) said the number of reported cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr Mirzadi, two of the victims are over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one is 41-50 years old.
He added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
One of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bangla Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Friendship Hospital, a local news agency said.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said that public transport will remain closed for longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
The closure of public transport began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods such as medical, fuel and food was still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 infection was recorded between two people returning to Italy and one of their wives in Bangladesh on March 8.
As of March 19, all three have recovered.
The number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has exceeded one million.
Johns Hopkins University reported on Thursday that the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus cases worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to the disease caused by coronavirus, COVID-19.
The important event occurred on the same day that Malawi confirmed their first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries left free of the coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) has registered 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 confirmed cases, in the previous 24 hours at 10 central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases were registered, linking at least 5,900 deaths.
According to CBS News, more than 1,000 people in the United States have died from the coronavirus on Wednesday.
Across the world, countries have announced strict measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
President Vladimir Putin has announced that the payment will continue until April 30, even if the Russians do not work.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national emergency by 15 days; 215 votes in favor, ten votes not given, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; the previous curfew was only effective from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to make the curfew a reality between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor, Mike DeWine, has announced that the state has extended its stay order until May 1.
The number of stores in Australia has decreased per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australia's store chain Olworths and Coles nationally reduced the restrictions on buying toilet paper per transaction to two and one package, respectively.
In addition, Aldi launched a one-pack limit on Monday.
These restrictions were posted as messages on checkouts and on the chain's Facebook pages.
It is being told that customers were stockpiling for fear of COVID-19 if people had to segregate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths-O made a pack per order, limiting the sale of toilet paper for home delivery.
These changes follow the limitations of the four packs behind the previous transaction that Ulworths and Coles launched on March 4 and 5, respectively.
"On March 8, Coles announced that the four-packet ban had been rolled out in different locations, but called the demand ""unprecedented"" and called it ""unprecedented"" in a Facebook post on ALDI on Tuesday."
According to a spokesperson for Ulworths, sales increased sharply last week.
The Canberra store was also allowed for two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortfall, Coles orders a larger package from suppliers and increases the rate of supply repetition, Woolworths orders additional stock, where ALDI makes stock available in advance for a planned special Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers' Association, said retailers tried to increase the stock, but local council restrictions made the matter difficult during delivery by trucks.
As suppliers try to meet demand, they expect the cost of production to increase.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that after leaving the stock earlier, some stores could not handle Wednesday's special sale.
In a news.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail sales expert from the University of Technology in Queensland, said that the shops fill their stores every night.
He remarked that toilet paper is a heavy substance that has a very low number of collections and when all is sold, the huge huge shelves are empty and reinforce the feeling of scarcity.
"According to ABC News, ""Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion that if he has a lot of stuff, and things like toilet rolls and sanitizers [can], and that's enough, then maybe that fear can be reduced,"" said Russell Zimmerman."
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, Hu Givs A Crap, said on Wednesday that their stock will be gone.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimerly-Clark, which manufactures cleaners toilet tissue and solaris paper, insists that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply.
A real estate site Domain.com reported that some property sellers were giving free toilet paper to the first bidder at the auction in Melbourne, some of which were due to be auctioned due to the buyers having a long weekend holiday.
In this Thursday's publication of Daily Printed NT News in Darwin, an eight-page appendage is offered for cutting pieces and is used as toilet paper.
A report received from ABC Australia on March 3 said the shops were reluctant to impose restrictions, where they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on their purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that the demand for other products is too high, including masks, sanitizers, dry products, handwash and flour.
In the same way, every Sunday evening outside Australia, the sale of paper used for Andress toilets in the online British supermarket Ocado is restricted to two 12-roll packs.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — as a pandemic.
"While the term ""extreme"" does not mean how dangerous specific cases are, but how widespread any disease has spread, the World Health Organization noted the need for governments to take action:"""
All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic.
"WHO Secretary-General Adhanom Ghebreyesus said if states can identify, ""test, treat, segregate, identify, and organize"".
"""We are deeply concerned by both the alarming level of disease spread and severity and the alarming level of inactivity."""
"According to Dr. Tom Fryden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is ""unprecedented""."
"In a statement published on CNN in February, he said, ""Except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been continuously tracked from the origins of the virus spreading around the world."""
"We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before,"" Gabresus said."
"He went on to say, ""And we have never seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."""
The new status as a global pandemic follows the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern in January.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said: ""The situation is going to get worse."""
The Associated Press reported on Thursday that the number of COVID-19 infections worldwide is at least 126,000, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been detected in 210 countries and union territories, resulting in nearly 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
Case fatality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while the worldwide rate ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Disorders Syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptoms is usually five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include washing hands, covering your face during coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and keeping yourself separate for people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded with travel control, quarantine, curfew, workplace risk control and closure of the facility.
The global pandemic has led to severe global socio-economic disruptions, sports, religious, political and cultural events have been cancelled, and shopping out of fear has led to an even greater supply shortage.
Schools and universities are no longer nationally, but are closed locally across 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's total student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of foreign intolerance and discrimination against other people from China, East and Southeast Asia, and others from areas where the virus has been found, depending on race and appearance.
Due to the closure of travel and heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) in China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases for unknown reasons on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to be an animal source.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronavirus, Banrui coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person who was diagnosed with the symptoms was later reported on 1 December 2019 that he fell ill; and later no visible association with the wet market cluster.
In December 2019, two-thirds of the initial cluster of cases were found to be linked to the market.
An unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 indicated that a case discovered on 17 November 2019 was probably the first one, which occurred in a 55-year-old man from Hubei province. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases in China had so-called declines, but the number of new cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea had grown exponentially.
The number of cases may be reduced, especially in people with mild symptoms.
By February 26, fewer cases were reported among young people, most of them under the age of 19 and 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Valens, the UK's chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population needed to be infected before the disease-resistance capacity was acquired.
According to the official protocol, the case refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and who have tested positive.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, made formal policies not to test only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that as of January 23, about 86% of the cases of COVID-19 in China had not been detected and the unreported infection was the source of 79% of the reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the official count of infections.
The initial estimate of the general reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it was likely 5.7.
Most of the people infected with COVID-19 have recovered.
For those who do not, the death interval is 6 to 41 days from the onset of symptoms, the most common of which is 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 97,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19.
As of February 5, 80% of deaths in China have occurred in people over the age of 60 and 75% of them already had various diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Official figures on COVID-19 usually indicate those who have been infected by COVID according to traditional rules.
The death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without tests - such as at home, nursing homes, etc.
Some partial data from Italy has found that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic has been 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death rate.
"A proponent of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States admitted that ""we know that [declared deaths] are lower estimates than the actual number"", a statement that was first documented in the United States on the 9th of January 2020, such devaluation often occurs in cases of the global pandemic, such as the 2009 H1 swine flu."
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1 and the first death outside Asia on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have been reported in Iran, South Korea and Italy outside mainland China.
As of March 13, deaths have been reported in more than 40 countries and territories on all continents of the world, except Antarctica. Several methods are used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region, and are obscured by the amount of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, the alternative to treatment, the time being cut since the initial outbreak, and the demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The proportion of death and infection shows the number of deaths within a given time limit divided by the number of cases diagnosed.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the worldwide mortality and case fatality ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the proportion of deaths and cases has dropped from 17.3% (those with symptoms between January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (those with first symptoms since February 1, 2020). Among other immune systems, those who have been diagnosed with the disease (CFR), the case fatality rate (which reflects the percentage of those who die from a disease) and the mortality rate of infection.
These statistics are not limited at any time and follow a specific population from infection through case analysis.
Many scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The Oxford University Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall mortality rate for this infection for the pandemic ranges from 0.1% to 0.39%.
The calculation on the upper side of this range is consistent with a statistical study of the first randomized tests of COVID-19 in Germany and the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO has said that the pandemic can be controlled.
The maximum limit and the final time frame of the project may vary according to uncertain and location.
"McCage Bonnie, from Penn State University, said: ""As a result of going from the test, infectious outbreaks usually dominate and then begin to decay when the disease no longer has a host."
However, it is almost impossible to predict when this will happen.
"China's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that if all countries could be brought together to follow the advice of the World Health Organization to prevent the spread of the virus, ""it could end in June""."
"On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 ""will likely continue to spread for a year or two."""
"According to a study by the Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, it is necessary to maintain ""physical distance and other measures"" until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)."
"William Shefner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it's quite impossible that this coronavirus—as it gets infected so quickly—will disappear completely"" and that it ""can turn into a seasonal disease, returning every year""."
The severity of the return will depend on the animal's immunity and the duration of the exposure.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected individuals can be symptomless.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include coughing, loss of breath, shortness of breath, pain in the muscles and restless joints, sore throat, headache, body aches, vomiting, coughing, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO has stated that one in about six people suffers from severe illness.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists respiratory, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, waking up and nausea appearance or lips as emergency symptoms; it is recommended to seek medical help immediately if these symptoms are present. The further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory disease syndrome, and the causes of death, sepsis,
Some of these infections may be asymptomatic without any clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so researchers have also issued advice to monitor and test from people who have come in contact with confirmed infections to avoid infection.
Chinese estimates of symptomless proportions range from a few to 44%.
The level of general incubation (the period during which infection and symptoms begin) ranges from 14 days to 5 days in a row. According to the example of uncertainty, the percentage of people with COVID-19 who initially lost their sense of smell is 30% and the account of those who are subsequently obese is 15%.
There are still some details on how the disease spreads.
The disease is thought to be spread mainly during close contact and by small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; close contact refers to being between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that watering from an open cough can range from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
According to some, the virus can also be infected by small fluid droplets that can be made while speaking, which last for a long time in the air. Respiratory salivas can also occur when breathing, including when talking, although the virus is not normally airborne.
Watermelons can enter the mouth or nose of those who are nearby, or they can enter the lungs through breathing.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to aerosols in the respiratory tract and can result in airborne transmission.
It can also spread when someone touches any contaminated surface, including the skin, and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is a concern that it can spread through the stool, this risk is considered to be low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of a mouth infection from SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious within the first three days after symptoms appear. Although it can be transmitted both before and after the symptoms appear.
Many people have tested positive three days before the onset of these symptoms, suggesting that the infection is possible before any significant symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases, but some countries have detected symptomless infections during a contact-finding investigation.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but a person usually infects two to three people. The virus survives on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, the virus is found in plastic (polypropylene) for three days, 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard and four hours in copper.
It varies, depending on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can spread the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as the infected people have to do after touching other surfaces.
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel and novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.
All the features of Novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all the related coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, this virus is killed by household soap as it breaks down the protective openings of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the real SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be a source of animal diseases.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically linked to the strain found in two bats in the subgenus Serbecovirus (Line B) with the genus Betacoronavirus.
The level of the full genome is 96% of the other bat's coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequence between the virus in the forest and the virus in the human body.
Compared to the entire genome so far, it has been found that Banrui is very similar to 92% of the genetic material when it comes to the coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that Banrui worked as a host in the middle.
The infection can be diagnosed through the virus depending on the symptoms temporarily, but ultimately confirm the reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of infected salivars.
A study comparing PCR with PCR in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less precise, and many of its photosynthesis properties are correlated with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for COVID-19 diagnosis""."
The WHO has released a few RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on breathing or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is performed on top of a nasopharyngeal soybe, but a throat soybe can also be used. Some laboratories and companies are preparing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of this has been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for far-reaching use.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Chelex was allowed to use only authorized laboratories in emergency situations.
Characteristic characteristics of people with symptoms taking photos in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) include the absence of abnormal peripheral ground glass opacity and pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of photographs taken from tests of confirmed cases.
For blending with other infections such as adenoviruses, the PCR has restricted the formation of any image without any confirmation and identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the PCR with the CT results of the chest and explained that, although imaging of the infection is now less specific, it is faster and more sensitive which suggests considering it as a screening device in the epidemiological affected areas.
Artificial intelligence is the birthing agency that prepares the virus's properties through radiographs and CTs.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining overall personal good hygiene, washing hands, not touching eyes, nose or mouth with washing hands, and sneezing or coughing in tissues and throwing that tissue into a garbage container.
Those who are already infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent infection. Many governments advised or controlled against all non-essential travel from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
The virus has spread to a large part of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading among the public and some people in the public community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended to use evidence alerts, contact alerts, and eye protection to healthcare providers serving someone who may be infected. It is very important for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and find people who are exposed to it to prevent further infections.
The use of mobile phone location information for this purpose by the administration has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 companies issued a statement calling for limiting such surveillance.
Multiple mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert teams are working on optimizing privacy solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to log in to other users' mobile phones.
Then users will get a message if they come in contact with someone who is COVID-19 positive. There are a number of misconceptions surrounding how to prevent the infection. For example, washing the nose and gargling with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many companies are working to create one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands occasionally with soap and water for at least a few seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are apparently dirty; before eating; before the nose shakes, while coughing, or sneezing.
Since the virus can be killed with domestic soap outside the human body, it breaks the protective bubble of the virus.
The CDC recommends that when soap and water are not available near the hand, sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol can be used instead.
The WHO has advised people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands.
Surfaces can be polluted with a few solutions (within a minute of exposure to disinfectants on the surface of stainless steel), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–0.2.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chloroquine gluconate are comparatively less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in any place such as office or day care, in that case the office, bathroom, common place, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control and ATM machines used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people fold their faces and noses in the course of coughing or sneezing or covering them with tissue paper, as well as discard the tissue properly.
People who are at risk of getting infected are advised to wear surgical masks. Wearing a mask can control the amount of waterborne particles and spreads when speaking, sneezing, or coughing.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
"According to virologist Stephen Griffin of the University of Leeds, "" wearing a mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene."""
The WHO has advised healthy people to wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their face.
Some countries have encouraged people to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing face non-medical masks made of cloth. China specifically advises healthy members of the public to use disposable medical masks, especially when approaching other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong government has advised people to wear a surgical mask during public transport or while staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, wearing a mask or not covering the nose or face is prohibited.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask while traveling to a crowded place to keep themselves and others safe.
The government of Austria has ordered that masks must be worn when entering every grocery store.
Israel has urged all its residents to wear masks whenever they go out.
Taiwanese people who have been producing about 10 million masks per day since mid-March are required to wear face masks on trains and inter-state buses to travel by April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear masks whenever you go out, and it has advised those who cannot buy face masks to wear face masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Maintaining social distancing (also known as maintaining physical distancing) also includes reducing close contact between individuals and controlling the spread of the disease by slowing the spread of the disease.
Methods include: being quarantined; limiting travel; closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shop-markets.
Individuals can apply methods of social distancing by limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, greeting without touching, and maintaining distance from physical contact.
Many governments are now making it mandatory to maintain social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
According to U.S. government authorities and health institutions, the maximum size of a combination quickly dropped from 250 people (if not known to have spread COVID-19 in the area) to 50 people and later to 10 people.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public gathering of more than two people. In addition to the physical distancing of older adults and the physical distancing of COVID-19 patients, people with underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and the ability to prevent the damaged disease "are at increased risk of serious illness and complications" in their communities.
"The use of the term ""social distancing"" has affected such a way that instead of encouraging people to keep in touch with others in an alternative way, it has led to a total social isolation."
This includes only sexual intercourse with someone who lives with you who does not have the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those who have been infected with COVID-19 and who suspect themselves to be infected.
Health agencies issued detailed guidelines for appropriate self-isolation. Many governments mandate or advise self-quarantine of all residents living in affected areas.
The strictest guidelines for self-quarantine have been issued for high-risk groups.
People who have come into contact with someone infected with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with a widespread infection have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible contact.
The strategies for controlling any outbreaks are prevention or suppression measures and dismantling.
The initial stages of the outbreak are controlled, and the rest of the population aims to detect and isolate infected people in order to stop the spread of the disease, as well as to introduce and immunize other infection control systems.
When it is no longer possible to sustain the spread of the disease in any way, efforts go to the level of mitigation: some remedies are taken so that the speed of this spread can be reduced to some extent and its impact on the healthcare system and society.
At the same time, both containment and mitigation (Nerson) may have to adopt a mixed standard.
In the case of repression, more extreme measures must be taken so that the number of primary breeds is reduced to less than 1 in the cycle of the pandemic. The maximum reduction of the epidemic is part of tackling the outbreak of any infectious disease, known as the flattening of the curve of the pandemic.
It reduces the risk of health care by becoming established and gives more time for vaccination and treatment so that it can be improved.
Other ways other than medicine that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand washing hygiene, wearing face masks, and quarantine yourself; stricter quarantine measures such as restricting the whole of travel to cities to prevent physical distancing, such as closing schools and canceling public gatherings; such other ways to admit and participate in public gatherings, such as clearing public spaces, including environmental measures.
Other countries have also adopted a number of standards to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea launched mass trials and local quarantines, and issued a warning on the activities of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased face masks and increased fines on medical supplies. The UK and the U.S. efforts to prove that mitigation (resilient but not preventing the spread of the pandemic) and suppression (increasing epidemic response) are a major challenge.
While the policies of the most sought-after elimination can reduce the highest demand for health care by 2/3 and death by half, the health systems are still disintegrating as a result of millions of deaths.
Repressing may be a way of choice, but it is necessary to maintain it as long as the virus remains in the human population (or as long as an immunization is available, if it comes first), as the virus's infection returns quickly if the arrangements are relaxed otherwise.
Long-term interventions to curb the pandemic cause social and economic harm.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop existing drugs, including testing.
Over-the-counter sarcoidosis, drinking fluids, and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on how serious the illness is, oxygen therapy, intravenous (through the veins) fluid and breathing support may be needed.
The use of steroids can lead to worse results.
Multiple compounds approved in the past for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also stated that some "traditional and home remedies" help alleviate the symptoms that can be seen as a result of SARS-CoV-19.
Acquiring a health centre for increased capacity and COVID-19 patients has been initially described by WHO as a preventive measure to prevent the outbreak of the disease.
The European Regional Office of the ECDC and WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary medical supplies centers to remove multi-layered sources and which include increasing the applicability of COVID-19 testing, increasing the number of intensive surveillance by separating and keeping COVID-19 positive patients and training staff, and the number of available ventilation and beds.
There are several theories as to where the first case (so-called Patient Zero) may have originated.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was detected on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
Most of these were related to the Huanan marine food wholesale market, where living animals were also sold, and according to a theory the virus came from such an animal; or otherwise said, there is an animal source. On 26 December a pneumonia cluster of unknown causes was observed and the doctor Zhang Jihanian (Zhong Jixian) was treated at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who was treated on 27 December,
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a ""SARS-like coronavirus""."
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were tried by the police for spreading false rumours, and another doctor, I Fein, was tortured by his high-ranking staff to expose the danger.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
In early January, Wuhan reported a number of unknown pneumonia cases, which are under investigation. At the initial stage of the outbreak, the number of cases has doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-2020, the virus spread to other parts of China, with the help of Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transportation hub and major rail junction.
On January 20, China said that about 140 new cases were detected in a single day, including two from Beijing and one from Shenzhen.
The following government data shows that as of January 20, 2020, 6174 people had already had symptoms. As of March 26, the United States has seen the highest number of confirmed cases in the world, surpassing China and Italy. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died, and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
There was at least one case of infection in nearly 200 countries and regions.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restrict free movement and impose border controls.
The national response includes some repressive measures such as keeping everyone isolated (known as a stay-at-home order or a place of shelter or lockdown) and curfew. As of April 2, around 300 million people or 90% of the population in the United States, more than 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India are in lockdown.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some sort of lockdown, which increased two days later to 2.6 billion - about one-third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was found in Wuhan on December 1, 2019, but according to an unconfirmed news, a case was first detected on November 17.
Dr Zheng Jijian noticed a cluster of pneumonia for unknown reasons on December 26, after which his hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
The initial genetic test of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
They were informed the same day.
"After these notifications were published, police were warning of ""spreading rumours"" about the outbreak of Wuhan's doctors."
"The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no ""clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission."
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a revolutionary campaign that later described the Chinese Communist Party's general secretary <0x58>i Jinping as a ""people's war"" to control the spread of the virus."
"A curfew was announced on January 23, ending travel to and from Wuhan, described as ""the largest quarantine in human history"", which was expanded to 15 cities in Hubei and affected a total of 57 million people."
Private vehicles are prohibited in the city.
The Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations have been cancelled in different places.
Officials also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
After the Leishenshan Hospital, another hospital was built to take care of additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China turned 14 other centers in Wuhan, such as the Convention Center and Stadium, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government took measures in the interest of taking additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including health declarations for tourists and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Schools and universities across the country have also been closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken various measures, especially in schools and universities.
Work from remote locations was arranged in many areas of China.
Hubei was placed under control over travel inside and outside.
Government transport systems across China were changed and museums were temporarily closed.
"Control was imposed on public movement in many cities and it is estimated that around 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some outside restrictions. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from becoming ""immigration"" from other countries."
For example, all international travelers entering the city of Beijing have declared it mandatory to be quarantined for 14 days. Only one case has been domestically infected in mainland China five days before March 23. It is found among a traveler returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang stated that the spread of internally infected cases had been largely blocked and the outbreak had been controlled in China.
Two months after the lockdown was imposed, control over travel to Hubei was eased on the same day, except for Wuhan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that the visa or residence permit holder's permission for people will be suspended from 28 March, and no specific details were given as to when the policy would end.
Those who want to enter China will have to apply for a visa at the Chinese Embassy or Consulate.
The Chinese administration encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and provided a financial stimulus package for companies. The State Council announced a day of mourning that began with a three-minute nationwide silence on April 4 at 10:00, the day when the Qingming festival was also held, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online while maintaining physical distancing to avoid a new outbreak of COVID-19.
On January 20, 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea.
The country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, mainly responsible for the new religious movement in Daegu, known as the Shincheonji Church of the Jews.
Visitors to the Shinchangji Church from Wuhan to Daegu were suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
Of the 9,336 church followers on February 22, 1,261 reported symptoms, or about 13%, of them. South Korea announced the highest level of warning on February 23, 2020.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on February 28, which increased to 3,150 on February 29.
All military bases in South Korea were set apart after three jawans tested positive for the virus.
The airline's schedule was also affected and changed, and South Korea launched a program to test people for the virus and isolate infected people and identify and quarantine those they came in contact with, which is considered to be the world's largest and best-organized program.
Screening methods, such as reporting their own symptoms to new international arrivals through mobile apps, the drive thru test of the virus, which results are available the next day, and the ability to test 20,000 people daily.
Without cities fully quarantined, the program in South Korea has been considered a success in preventing the outbreak. South Korean society was first polarized in response to President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed the petition, claiming the outbreak was officially misused and calling for Moon's impeachment or praising his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of one-day cases in a total of four weeks.
On March 29, it was announced that all new arrivals from abroad will be quarantined for two weeks starting April 1.

Iran has allocated <0x24>5 trillion to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that there was no plan to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and that only individual individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between different cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic continued between cities as the Parsi New Year was ahead of Nooroz.
Shia religious sites in Kom were open until 16 March 2020. Iran became the epicentre of the virus after China in February.
In the midst of demands for a spike in the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries found Iran as the source of their infection by February 28, indicating that the outbreak levels were much higher than the 388 infections reported by the Iranian government until that date.
On March 3, 23 of Iran's 290 members tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, the Human Rights Observer appealed to Iran's prison authorities to unconditionally release the human rights violators detained for peaceful dissent and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It is said that confined institutions, such as prisons, have a higher risk of spreading the virus, which also lacks proper medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported that 100 deaths were reported in a day, the highest in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials have died of the disease as of March 17.
On March 23, Iran reported 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, the number of infections reported in Iran may be five times higher.
The U.S. sanctions on Iran may be damaging the country's financial capacity to deal with the outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for lifting economic sanctions for Iran, including those countries that have suffered the most from the pandemic.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases are starting to grow more intensely, prompting the Italian government to close all flights from China and issue a state of emergency in the country.
A series of unorganised COVID-19 cases were found after 16 confirmed cases were reported in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the cabinet issued a new law regarding the outbreak, in which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were separated from each other.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "The outbreak has shown that entry and exit will not be allowed in all places."
"In those areas, work has already been disrupted and sporting events have been suspended. ""On March 4, the Italian government ordered a complete shutdown of all schools and universities at the national level as the death toll in Italy reached 100."""

The UK first responded to the virus with the most relaxed response among affected countries, and as of March 18, 2020, the British administration did not impose any social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received a lot of criticism for not being able to realize the importance and importance of the impact of the disease on people.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the main public health organization in the U.S. administration, announced that they had prepared their own test kits.
However, the U.S. has been testing at a very slow rate, leading to the actual amount of infection being smoked during the spread of the disease.
The defective test kits produced by the state government in February and the lack of state government approval over private test kits (education centres, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and the man's regulatory qualification to qualify for a test by the beginning of March (then a doctor's order was required) were hampered.

The SARS outbreak of WHO 2002–2004, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of protecting privacy that hampered the prevention and control efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government "gives regular updates to avoid panic before the Central New Year holiday" noted the difference between the two.
"On January 23, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement the transportation ban in Wuhan, WHO Representative Gooden Galli commented that ""WHO did not make this recommendation for sure"", and that it was a very important indication of the WHO's commitment to curbing the global pandemic in the place where its concentration was highest, and called it the ""unprecedented increase in the history of public health""."
"The WHO Director-General said that the reason for the PHEIC was ""the risk of global spread is higher in low and middle-income countries where there is no advanced medical system""."
"In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said there was ""no reason for such footprints that unnecessarily interfered with international travel and business"" and also said that ""WHO does not recommend limiting business and activities."""

"As a result, a UN crisis management team was activated, which allowed the entire nation to coordinate the response of the United Nations, which, according to WHO, would allow them to ""focus on health response, and other agencies would use their expertise to deal with the broader social, economic and developmental impacts of the outbreak."""
On 14 February the WHO Tha led joint expedition team was activated with China to bring the international and WHO expert team to China’s soil so that they could help in the domestic management of the country’s “provider preparedness for the outbreak” and that it should be possible to “determine the severity and transmission of the disease” to assess the impact of the pandemic through meetings with various workshops and major national institutions, and travel to the appropriate “provincial and county levels, including urban and rural systems.”
"In response to the rise of the outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent out a joint mission to assess the situation there.

A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been dismissed for their efforts to isolate people in the central China region, which clearly shows a sign of dissatisfaction with political organizations centering on the outbreak of disease in these regions.
Some critics believe the move was aimed at protecting <0x58>i Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, from public anger due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, whose origins are in the United States or Italy, denied an earlier confession about the first outbreak of the coronavirus in Wuhan.
"Donald Trump's U.S. administration described the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" or the Wuhan virus, saying China's ""censorship has supercharged a virus that has now become a global epidemic"", which some critics have responded to as racist and ""try to mislead from the failure of its administration to prevent this disease""."
"The Daily Beast received a speech about the U.S. government's conduct that outlines a communication strategy with existing sources in the National Security Council, where the strategy was cited as ""everything related to China""."

"The source blamed Russia for a campaign to please Russia ""geographically and diplomatically""."
Lombardi's President Atl<0xC3><0xA9>tio Fonta and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi de Maio rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter asking for help from world leaders on March 14, 2020, where he said that the United States is making it difficult for them to fight the outbreak as its country lacks access to international markets due to sanctions against Iran. These outbreaks have made it difficult for the U.S. to impose universal health care, universal child care services, and high salaries for families in the United States.
Political analysts speculated that it could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated during the global pandemic.
"After Japan announced that it would put anyone from South Korea in quarantine for two weeks, South Korea criticized Japan's ""clear and inactive quarantine efforts""."
South Korean society was initially at a crossroads over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many signed the petition calling for the dismissal of the Korean Moon, while others applauded his response. The global pandemic has given many countries the opportunity to enact emergency legislation in response.

In Hungary, its parliament gives Prime Minister Viktor Orban the right to rule indefinitely, to suspend parliament or run the election process, and to punish the respected people who are spreading misinformation about how the disease spreads and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for a shortage of supplies, an increase in global use of materials needed to fight the pandemic, panic and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased demand from buyers and disruption of suppliers.
Shops were also seen in multiple areas due to panic, which led to people buying more and more essential items like food items, toilet paper and bottled water, which led to a shortage of ghogan in Jogan.
The tech industry, in particular, has warned of delays in sending electrical products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has risen 20 times the normal price and caused a six-month delay in the supply of medical supplies.
It created a global shortage of personal protective equipment, and the WHO warned that it would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has given retailers a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China.
The activity resulted in a lack of baby formulas in some supermarkets and later the Australian government banned. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan regions, ensuring excessive demand for food items, both regions have fallen short of food shortages in severe form.
China and Italy's measures against stockpiling essential goods and illegal trade have been successful, avoiding the acute shortage of food in North America as well as in Europe.
Although there is no significant decline in the agricultural products of Northern Italy, the prices may rise, according to industry representatives.
When officials of the Chinese government abandoned pork stocked to provide enough nutrition to the public, they even initially faced empty food in Wuhan.
Italy has a similar national law that asks food producers to keep food stock for such emergencies.
The loss to the world economy has also been felt in China: According to a media report on March 16, China's economy has been hit very strongly in the first two months of 2020 due to the government's measures to reduce the spread of the virus and retail sales of retail or retail have fallen 20.5%.
Since China's mainland plays a major role as a hub for economy and production, the outbreak of the virus threatens to create a major unstable situation for the world economy.
The Economist Intelligence Unit's Agathe Demarais predicts that markets will remain volatile until a more clear picture is released on the possible outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts speculated that the economic catastrophe could surpass the SARS outbreak of 2002–2004 due to the pandemic in global growth.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimates that the world's supply chain has suffered more than <0x24>300 billion in losses that could last up to two years.
"The Oil Exports Organisation (OPEC) was reported to have ""behind the knee"" after the fall in oil prices due to a fall in demand from China."
The global stock market fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, multiple U.S. stock exchanges, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 Suk and Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their own sharpest fall since 2008, including Dow 1,191 points, the largest one-day fall since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
All three indicators increased by more than 10% over the weekend.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The stock market fell again on March 16 due to the fear of coronavirus.
Many consider the possibility of economic recession.
Economist Muhammad L-Aryan appreciated the timely emergency measures of the central bank and the state.
The central banks are dealing with the pace at which Mohawk faced the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected departments due to the government's ban on tourism, all populated places, including the attractive tourism sector, and any kind of travel around the world.
As a result, multiple airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, cancelled flights for relatively low demand, as British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
There has never been a significant impact on the maritime industry.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
During the Chinese New Year holiday, the main season of a trip to China called Chunyun began, at which time the pandemic began in China.
Many events where there could be a lot of public gatherings, such as annual New Year celebrations, etc., have been closed by national and regional governments. Private companies are also closing their shops on their own and closing various interesting tourist destinations such as Hong Kong’s Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many lunar New Year celebrations and tourist gatherings have been closed, including the fairs of the banned city and traditional temples in Beijing to prevent public gatherings.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions extended New Year's holidays until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response levels to the maximum and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and canceling New Year's celebrations. The global retail sales sector has been affected by a decline or temporary closure during the opening of stores.
Sales in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East have seen a 50-60% decline.
As a result, the number of buyers in shopping centers fell 33–43% in March compared to February.
Worldwide shopping mall managers imposed additional measures, such as increasing the health system, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and canceling events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession triggered by the global pandemic could put 14 to 22 million more people in extreme poverty than the situation in Latin America if the global pandemic did not exist.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs in the final stages of the pandemic in Wuhan.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have either been rendered helpless at home in the inland regions or stranded in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis calculations, the coronavirus outbreak could result in 47 million people losing jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. The lockdown in India has resulted in millions of Indian migrant workers (those who lost their jobs per day/employees) being unemployed. A survey by the Angus Red Institute showed that 44% of families were unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British employees applied for a universal credit project. About half a million companies in Germany have sent their employees to a government-subsidized short-term work plan known as Kurtzerbet.
The German short-term compensation scheme has also been approved by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage fields have been deeply damaged by this pandemic, which has affected the activities of companies, as well as individuals - both employed and independent - globally.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector sought to maintain their own (often officially funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage in the community, to protect their employees and people, and to cooperate with artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions around the world and at various levels have been closed indefinitely by cancelling or delaying their exhibitions, events and performances.
The response was accompanied by intense efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of this disease is religious services, major sporting events and concerts and other social events such as conferences on technology and fashion shows.
The film industry also saw a breakdown. The Vatican declared the last week of the Christian Lenten’s unhappy season, which is celebrated in Rome, as a holy week.
Many Diocese elders have advised Christians to stay at home instead of coming to Sunday; some have provided church service via radio, online live streaming or television, while others are organizing worship without getting out of the car.
With the closure of its churches and chapels by Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome and the sanctity of Saint Peter's Square, other religious directorates also cancelled services and restricted public gatherings at churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurudwaras.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and later religious sites were closed, and Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims from entering the holy sites of Mecca and Medina, as well as residents of the country.
The pandemic is one of the most significant disasters in the world's sporting calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been canceled or postponed.
"This outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event ""will not be held after the summer of 2021, although rescheduled on a date after 2020""."
Reports of significant growth of new sign-ups on gambling sites suggest that many gamblers have moved online. In order to suspend or cancel various music groups, the entertainment industry has also been affected.
Many major theatres, such as those on Broadway, have suspended all performances.
"Some artists continued to compose and share art through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as creating live streaming of concerts or web-based ""festivals"" so that artists can perform, distribute and promote their work."
Online, firefighting has spread to the memes of the Internet that have been the subject of the coronavirus, which is very ridiculous and also removes the eye from these uncertainties.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, people from Chinese and East Asian ancestry, and people from hotspot areas in Europe, the United States, and other countries, have also seen an increase in predicament, fear of foreigners, and racism.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific, fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed.
Cases reported since February have documented racist sentiments on various groups of Chinese people around the world, claiming they are worthy of the virus or what is being done to them as a fair retaliation.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-China sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have been discriminated based on regional etymology.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and there was also support for the people in the virus-hit region.
Italians, who have experienced the dire experience of COVID-19 outbreak as Europe’s first country in terms of progress in new hotspot countries, may be skeptical and foreign. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed petitions initially to prohibit Chinese people from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, this hash tag was very popular with <0x23>ChineseJapan.
The number of attacks against Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States is also increasing.
"US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"", as critics consider the wording to be racist and anti-Chinese."
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and passengers from Wuhan to Nabi Sanjahar.
Students from Northeast India, which shares a border with China, who are studying in major cities of India, are said to have been subjected to harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the president of the West Bengal state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party, said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and that is why God took revenge against them.
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata has sharply criticized the comment and called it "misleading." Genophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents in China has increased further during the pandemic. Here foreigners are described as "foreign garbage" and are identified as "exotic waste".
There are several other newspapers, including Paywall, that have removed them from their partial or complete coronavirus coverage.
Many specific publications have created science related works that are available in open access.
Some scientists are quick to publish their results on some innovative servers such as BioR<0x58>.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include procedures that detect the presence of the virus and identify antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and only designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a very recent or active infection.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and surveillance on the public.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including people who were too negligible to report symptoms or who were symptomless.
The results of these tests can determine an accurate mortality of the disease and the ability to prevent groupic disease in the public.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable information on the outbreak of the virus in their public domain.
No country has tested more than 3% of their population as of March 23, and there is a huge variation in how many tests have been conducted across different countries.
This difference will likely significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
In addition to nasopharyngeal soybe or sputum samples, samples of the respiratory system obtained through various methods can be tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with a sore throat is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
The virus may later disappear from the throat, but the number of lungs may continue to increase.
In the case of infected people tested in the second week, otherwise the sample material may be taken from the deep of the respirator by the suction catheter, or the excreted object (sputum) with the cough may be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 at Charit<0xC3><0xA9> in Berlin, using the Real-Time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and it formed the basis of 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test between January 23, 2020. The South Korean company Kozenebiotech developed a clinical-stage PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
"It explores the common ""E"" gene contained in all beta coronaviruses and the characteristic RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2 distributed by the SARS-CoV-2 resveratrol international health group. The BGI Group was one of the first companies in China to have received emergency use authorization from the National Medical Products Administration (DRCD) for its COVID-19 detection kits in the United States."
Unresolved results caused by defective agents in one of the three genetic tests of older versions of test kits and an obstacle to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in the successful processing of fewer than 100 samples per day throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not determined to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. US business labs began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics likewise made available the nationwide COVID-19 test on March 9, 2020.
Quantitative restrictions have not been announced; sample collection and processing must be performed as per the requirements of the CDC.
The COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR, in Russia.
The test was registered on 11 February 2020 by the Federal Service for Survival in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, a report was found that Mayo Clinic had prepared a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics had the FDA’s approval to conduct an experiment that could have been performed in excess of 3.5 hours, thus a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted Abbott Laboratories emergency use authorization (Emergency Use Authorization, EUA) for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously approved Holographic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received the EUA from the FDA for a test, which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a periodic temperature cycle, this method can give positive results in less than five minutes and can give negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such devices in the U.S. and Abbott hopes to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. One test uses a monoclonal antibody, which is precisely aligned with the new coronavirus's nucleocapsid protein (N protein), and just like a rapid influenza test so this test can be expected to deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes.
"A literature review of March 2020 concluded that ""the importance of chest radiographs in early stages is very low in diagnosis, but data from CT [Computed tomography] may even have existed before symptoms began."""
The features of the CT include an edge, two-sided, multilober ground-glass opaqueness with an uneven and backward distribution.
With the onset of the disease, subplural domination, crazy paving and consolidation were seen.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan, the current epicentre of the pandemic, has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less precise, and many of its features are correlated with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-order test for COVID-19 or as a first-line test for diagnosis""."
Antibody production is part of the immune response to infections, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infections in humans starting from 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine the immune system and to monitor the public. Assessments can be carried out by the central laboratory (central laboratory, CLT) and point-of-care testing, POCT.
High-performance automated systems in many essential laboratories will be able to perform at this assay, but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
A single sample of marginal blood for CLT is commonly used, although sequential samples can also be used to follow the immune response.
In general, a single sample of blood is taken by spraying on the skin for POCT.
An extraction step is not required before tests like the PCR procedure. On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 organizations that provided notifications to the agency as needed and now they are therefore able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, a single test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The capacity of the test is a few hundred samples in a few hours, and for that reason it is much faster than the traditional PCR evaluation of the viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK found that any antibody test kits they bought were not good enough for use.
"Hong Kong has developed a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube"", he will spit in it, send it back, and get the results of the test a little later. The British NHS has announced that it is launching a plan on an experimental basis to test suspected cases of COVID-19, which eliminates the risk of infecting other people by the patient when they go to a hospital."
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive test of any country. The National Association of Statistical Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on March 2 that they have the capacity to conduct around 12,000 tests per day in a mobile setting and 10.700 people were tested in the previous week.
When the test is performed on a doctor's order, health insurance costs are borne.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
A drive-in test was conducted in many major cities on 19 March.
The total number of tests conducted in Germany on 26 March 2020 was unknown, as only positive cases were reported.
"A first lab study revealed that up to the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of 483,295 samples were tested in the clinical trial of at least 10,000 patients up to 12/2020, which included a total of 5,491 samples in the laboratory", and that in the test, a total of 33,491 samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital tested samples from 64 patients simultaneously.
BGI founder Wang Jian supervised the construction and modelled it to be done within 5 days, showing that if the testing capacity did not increase in time, Hubei's cases would be 47% higher and the corresponding cost of dealing with quarantine would double.
Huo-Yan Labs in a total of 12 cities across China, such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, quickly followed Wuhan Laboratory.
The testing capacity was a total of 50,000 per day as of 4 March 2020. Open source, multiplexed designs published by Origami Assays have been released that can test a maximum of 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
By March, the lack of reagents and insufficient amounts had become a limitation in mass testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
Because of this, some researchers explored sample preparation protocols where samples were heated for 5 minutes at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is now testing more people for the coronavirus than in other countries and testing levels are on track to increase to reach much of the population.
"This was done through a combination of drive-thru capability and a combination of a population-scale production lab purchase from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)."
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands more RT-PCR tests per day and is the first lab in the world to operate outside China.
Various methods of testing were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile.
The German system of production of kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to make their own kits was adopted by the World Health Organization.
The German system was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol prepared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (United States Centers for Disease Control) was not available until 28 January, which delayed the available tests in the U.S. There was a problem between China and the U.S. regarding the reliability of the test kits to be sufficiently tested at the onset of the outbreak of the disease, and was tested by these countries and experts in Australia to meet the needs and health.
On the contrary, experts have said that more testing in South Korea has helped in reducing the spread of the coronavirus.
The South Korean administration has developed the ability to test primarily in private sector labs over the years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus led to the creation of millions of test pending work in private U.S. labs, and the supply of swabs and chemical disruptors was strained.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in its test kits.
"The test kits prepared by the CDC in the U.S. had ""errors""; then the administration removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private trials. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were wrong."
The company explained that incorrect results may result in failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry said that they would withdraw the wrong results kits, and replace them with a different kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The Czech Republic gave 80% of the test kits that were purchased from China. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be untrue.
"Prime Minister Matovich (Matovi<0xC4><0x8D>) offered to throw them into the Danube River. Atesh Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had ""high-rate errors"" and that they ""did not use those kits""."
Testing and then quarantining those who have tested positive and finding contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive people were found to have positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vogue, the first death toll from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests over a total population of 3,400 people in a span of about ten days.
Nearly half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms and all the people who were detected were quarantined.
Controlling traffic in the community has completely eliminated new infections.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slower than other developed countries, with no extreme control over aggressive detection, inbound travel control, testing and quarantine, but forcing restaurants and retail outlets to shut down.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened on time after a holiday break on March 23.
Many other countries have also controlled the global pandemic with less aggressive lock-downs, including Iceland and South Korea, through aggressive search, inbound travel control, testing and quarantine.
A statistical study found that countries that tested higher than the number of deaths had a much lower mortality rate, as these countries were probably able to identify patients with mild or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have the ability to test and have limited experience with COVID-19, the first five positive and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples should be sent to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Among the 16 reference laboratories, there are 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
"In the following chart, ""What percentage of tests are positive"" columns are influenced by the test policy of that country."
In a country where only hospitalized people are tested, the positive percentage will be higher than in a country where everything else is equal, whether or not all citizens are tested.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, refers to the work of washing a person's hands to remove soil, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands regularly with soap during certain “important moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted through the path of stools – mouth cavity.
People may also suffer from respiratory diseases such as influenza or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five most important moments of the day when washing hands with soap are: before and after shaving, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing the nape, before feeding the baby, and before and after cooking food or giving raw meat, fish, or poultry hands.
Hands can be washed with ash if water and soap are not available. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child who used the toilet.
After your nose, cough or sneezing.
after touching animal, animal food, or animal waste.
Hand hygiene refers to healthy habits related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before taking medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to keep hands clean from germs (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who care for or work for food in the medical field, but it is also an important method for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the transmission of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
Reducing the mortality rate of children at home.
A 2013 study found that improved hand-washing habits can drive children under the age of five to develop a shorter lifespan.
In developing countries, the death rate of children with respiratory and diarrhoea-related diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This normal process can reduce the mortality rate by about 50% from this disease.
The measures taken to encourage hand washing can reduce the diarrhoea phase by about a third, and it is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap is associated with a 48% reduction in diarrhoea incidence. Hand washing with soap is performed as an automatic habit in homes, schools, and communities around the world with the sole most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
Pneumonia, which is a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five. It takes away the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia are the leading causes of approximately 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to the UNICEF, changing to a strong habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than a single vaccine or medical intervention, reduce diarrhoea deaths by about half, and reduce death by one-fourth from acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is integrated with other sanitation systems as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Washing hands protects against infectious skin disease (impetigo) that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
One of the less harmful effects of hand washing is frequent hand washing that can cause skin damage due to skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to a rash, skin rash, known as hand eczema or hand skin disease, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five most important times of the day when washing hands with soap are: after using the bathroom (neutral, defecation), after cleaning the baby's lower abdomen or changing nappies, before feeding the baby, before eating, and before/after handing over food to raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when proper hand washing techniques should be applied to prevent infection of the disease include before and after treatment for cuts or wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or nausea; after touching the animal waste or shaking the animal; and after touching the garbage.
In many countries, the rate of washing hands with soap is very low.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households were used to hand washing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of development at 97 percent; the United States had a moderate number of children in the middle of a school at about 77 percent; and China had the lowest number of handwashing practices for 23 percent. There were now several changes in the habit of children to increase their handwashing habits with soap during times of crisis.
"The ""Essential Health Care Program"" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of adequate measures to promote children's health and education."
The main purpose of such a program is to wipe twice a year, wash your hands with soap every day, brush your teeth with fluoride.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to water increases the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce the blockage of the solution and increase the solubility.
Just because water is ineffective skin cleanser (skin cleanser) is because fat and protein, which are organic soil material, do not dissolve easily in water.
Cleanliness is certainly done with the help of moderate water flow.
Nirate soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain bacteria derived from previous use.
A small number of studies that focused on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap to bacteria concluded that there was less chance of transfer because bacteria were washed with foam.
"The CDC still says that ""recommended for the application of liquid soaps that can be controlled without the use of hands""."
There has been a lot of public awareness about antibacterial soaps.
To date, no evidence has been found of the use of antiseptic or disinfectant recommended for nature's antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial ingredients such as triclosan, which have the ability to prevent organism at higher levels.
Thus, although antibiotic resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective ingredients, the PH in sophisticated preparation has been used as an anti-anxiety agent for the treatment of allergenic acids (asynchronous acids, ascorbic acids, lactic acids) as well as an antimicrobially active benzoic acid and additional skin conditioners (alolves, vitamins, ments, plant extracts)
Hot water for hand washing is not enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water to remove natural oils that hold soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load in the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic that is not water-based.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-based alcohol rubs began to gain popularity (also known as alcohol-based rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers).
Most are made based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol produced together with concentrated ingredients such as acrylic acid polymers or glucamines in the gel, such as liquids or in the foams, to reduce the ease of use and the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding mixed hydrogen-peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizer contains a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol which is efficient in killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitisers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, Herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitiser contains 70% alcohol which kills 99.97% (equivalent to 3.5 log reduction, 35 decibel reduction) after 30 seconds of application in hand and kills 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 log reduction) bacteria after 1 minute of application in hand. Hand sanitizers are the most effective against bacteria and a few viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis, almost completely ineffective against the virus of the type of norovirus (or Norwalk). Both hands should use enough hand antiseptic or alcohol rubs to simmer well or move forward.
The liquid, foam or gel is rubbed in the front and back of both hands and the middle of the fingers until it dries out and the end edge is rubbed for about 30 seconds.
Fingernails should also be thoroughly washed with a pair of palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend washing hands thoroughly with hand sanitizer rubs, especially when dirt is seen.
The increasing use of these components depends on their ease of use and quick disinfection of microorganisms; they should not be used as correct hand washing replacements if soap and water are not available.
If the formula does not contain amolient and/or skin moisturizers, frequent use in alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other lotions to the formula.
In medical tests, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with softer ingredients caused significantly less tension and dryness to the skin than soap or disinfectant detergents.
Hypersensitivity to allergy exposure to skin, contact dandruff, or alcohol or alcohol-related objects rarely occur in the hand rub.
Compared to washing hands with soap and water, the lower tendency to initiate painful touching dermatitis became a source of attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, the waterless material does not clean the organic matter of the hands, but only disinfects the hands.
Since pathogens still remain in the hands, this is why effective hand sanitizers such as soap and water are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends on the material and the preparation to a greater extent, and in the past, alcohol and alcohol did significantly less work than rubs.
Recently, the use of benzalkonium chloride has been shown to maintain stable and growing antimicrobial activity after the user has applied the preparation, which is not like alcohol, which is likely to decrease performance after repeated use due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
In a low-income society, many people do not have money to spend for soap and instead use ash or soil.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it can increase rather than reduce the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because it makes alkaline solution in contact with water.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap if soap is not found.
The correct hand washing techniques recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease infection include the following steps:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
Water is recommended because permanent basins can be contaminated, but the water temperature does not seem to make any difference.
Take the soap foam on the back of the hand, with enough soap in between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin and studies have shown that people wash their hands better when using soap instead of water.
Hold for at least 20 seconds.
There is friction during scrubbing which removes germs from the skin and removes more germs when rubbing for a long time.
Wash well with water.
Washing hands in the sink can be contaminated again.
Wash with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and moist hands are more easily re-polluted. The places that are most left out are the fingers, wrists, fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can provide shelter to microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended so that the hands are not dry; dry skin can damage the skin, which can increase the risk of infection spreading.
"In developing countries where tap call water and/or soap is not available, various low-cost options can be created for hand washing facilities, for example using hanging jars or water pouring from a suitable holed lou and/or using ash as needed. In limited water supply situations (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are other ""tip-tap-sun-like"" water-like options."
Tippy-tape is a simple technology where a jug hung by a rope and a foot-propelled lever and a piece of soap are used to pour a small amount of water into the hand.
Hand-washing is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective type of drying in a public bathroom.
The increasing amount of research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers found in many washrooms.
Paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and more modern jet-air hand dryers were produced by the paper towel industry European tissue symposium in 2008 and a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London.
After washing hands and drying with warm-air dryers, the total number of bacteria increased by 194% on the finger and 254% on the palm of the hand.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increases the total number of bacteria on an average by 42% and by 15% on the palm of the hand.
After hand-washing with paper towels after hand washing, the total bacteria decreases by an average of 76% in the fingers and up to 77% in the palm of the hand. Scientists also examined whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination (cross-contamination) for other washroom users and washroom environments as a result of each type of drying.
The jet-air dryer, which generates air at a sustained speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow off microorganisms from the hands and units and eliminate possible contamination of the washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 meters.
The use of a warm-air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant expansion of micro-organisms. In 2005, a study led by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt and Umwelt evaluated different hand drying methods.
The following changes have been observed in the number of bacteria after hand drying:
Many different types of hand dryer manufacturers exist and compared hand dryers with drying with paper towels.
Hand washing is an option to use hand sanitizing wipes in the absence of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer contains at least 60% alcohol.
The Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis was forced to discover the effectiveness of handwashing (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are some electronic devices that hospital staff give feedback to remind them when they forget to wash their hands.
A study has shown a decrease in the rate of infection using them.
Medical hand-washing is done using soap and water or gel for a minimum of 15 seconds, and each part of the hand is used to remove foam.
The fingers should be folded together.
A brush can be used to remove it if there is dirt under the nails.
Since germs can be in the water of the hand, it is important to wash and dry with clean towels.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water faucet (and open another door to exit if necessary).
This will prevent the re-pollution of the hands from these surfaces.
"The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogens (""bacteria"") that cause disease and to avoid infection."
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the shortage of hand washing remains at an unacceptable level in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, thus causing microorganisms to be infected.
One study found that proper hand-washing and other simple methods could reduce the rate of catheter-related blood flow transmission by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published the standard hand-washing and hand-washing paper in the Department of Health Care.
Draft guidelines on hand hygiene by the organization for public comments can also be found on its website.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby and others.
Commercial devices can measure and verify the hygiene of the hands if the need for regular follow-up verification.
"The World Health Organization has ""Five Moments"" for Hand Washing:"
After exposure to the blood/body fluid
prior to the release of the disease, and
"After taking care of the patient. The antiseptic chemical additive (""addicted"" or ""antimicrobial"" soap) in soap provides the ability to destroy the hand wash material."
The surgical procedure can be performed either before surgery or in places where there is a prophylactic antibiotic resistance. It is important to have a call for surgery to 'screw' your hands, which can be turned on and off without touching hands. Some chlorohexidine or ionoids to wash hands after washing, disinfection for washing and disinfection.
All decorations must be opened.
This procedure usually requires washing hands and elbows for 2-6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub the hands for a long time (10 minutes).
At the time of washing, the water from the wrist to the elbow must be prevented from moving to the palm of the hand again.
After the hand wash is finished, the hands are washed with sterile cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after serving the sick person or use hand antiseptic.
In order to control staphylococcal infections in the hospital, it was found that the maximum benefit of hand-washing was from the first 20% wash, and the additional benefit was found to be very little when the hand-washing repeat was increased to over 35%.
Washing with ordinary soaps than with antibacterial soaps results in three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases in food. Reduced hand-washing with anti-bacterial soaps by more than 26% by hand-washing with hand-washing hand-washing with antibacterial soap for 30 seconds. Each showed that antibacterial soaps are more effective than hand-washing.
But soap and water/water from alcohol-based hand rubs are more effective at reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clusterium Difficile seeds. Hand washing to improve hand hygiene in healthcare environments, may involve staff’s education and staff’s involvement in the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs.
More research is needed to determine which of these improvements are most effective in different healthcare environments.
Washing hands with soap is recognized in developing countries as a safe and effective means of achieving good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities at people's homes, schools and workplaces creates a challenge for achieving universal hand washing habits.
For example, in most parts of rural Africa, there is a cheaper option to create a hand wash space, but there is rarely a hand wash call near each individual or public toilet.
However, the low hand washing rate may be due to a deep-rooted habit rather than lack of soap or water/water.
The promotion and advice of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and lead to changes in people's long-term habits.
In order for it to work effectively, it is necessary to monitor and evaluate.
"A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods at LMIC are effective in handwashing, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of the campaign on handwashing in schools is UNICEF's ""Three Star Approach"" which gives schools easy, affordable incentives to take steps to ensure that hand washing is done with soap to students in other healthful needs."
If the minimum standard is achieved, schools can reach three stars from one to the last.
Setting up a hand wash station can be a part of helping hand washing campaigns that are conducted to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns that are striving to change habits. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the recognition of handwashing emojis.
DALYs have considered a few studies on the overall cost savings of hand washing in developing countries on prevention.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing with soap is comparatively more affordable than other water/water and sanitation systems.
"The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for people in unprotected situations, such as mothers who have given birth to babies in hospitals or wounded soldiers — recognized it in the first half of the 19th century: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelews who worked in Vienna, Austria", and the founder of Florence Nigel, England.
By that time, most people believed that the infection was caused by a bad smell called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health care-related infections led the United States to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
With the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many countries have raised awareness about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
"For example, in Germany, posters with ""correct hand washing techniques"" were hung in public toilets and in office buildings and airport toilets next to hand wash sinks."
"This kind of phrase ""sniffing the hands of the individual"" means to take responsibility for the matter or to express the person's unwillingness to be a partner in the act."
Originating from part of the Bible in Matthew, where Ptius Pilates shook hands with the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a language expression by more widespread use among a few English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up her insanely imaginative scars by revealing her sense of guilt about the crime she committed and her husband had committed.
It has also been observed that people, when they think or think about immoral acts, tend to wash their hands much more often than others, and to give more value to hand washing equipment.
"In addition, those who have been given to wash their hands after such an intent are less likely to engage in other ""cleaning"" compensatory activities, such as volunteering."
Both for healthful and symbolic purposes, the religion commands hand washing. Symbolic hand washing, using water/water for hand washing but not using soap, is a part of the religious practice characterized by many religions, including Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> religion, Hinduism, Judaism, Tevilah and Netilat Yad<0xC3><0xA1>d<0xC3><0xAD>m, following certain rituals to perform religious rituals, and Islam.
Washing hands is mandatory in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam after the use of toilets.
And, every time before and after meals, it is mandatory to wash hands in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam.
Workplace Risk Control for COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health procedures to control the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper risk controls in the workplace depend on the place of work and the work to be done, based on a risk assessment of contact sources, the severity of disease in the public, and the risk factors for individual workers who may be at risk of COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the United States, low-risk contacts lead to minimal professional contact with the public and other colleagues, for which normal measures of infection prevention are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging employees to stay at home, and ensuring safe working conditions.
Medium-risk jobs in contact include those jobs that are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but require frequent or close contact with people who may be infected due to ongoing disease or international travel in the workplace.
This includes employees who have contact with the public, such as in schools, high-density work environments, and some in the more crowded retail range.
In addition to the initial infection prevention measures, the risk control system for this group includes using improved capacity air filters to keep ventilation, sneezing guards and personal protective equipment available when exposed to a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA health workers and those working in the morgue seem to have a higher risk of exposure to people with COVID-19 who are confirmed or suspected. This increases the risk if these workers apply aerosol-producing procedures or through this process collect samples of people with COVID-19 who are suspected or suspected.
The appropriate risk controls for these employees include engineering controls such as a negative pressured air circulation room, and personal protective equipment suitable for the job.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have many effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to getting sick, taking care of others, or fearing possible exposure.
There is a demand for any products and the way to buy these products (such as shopping at a time when there is no engagement, or through delivery or drive-through service (buying from the car) can change the way of business from both sides.
Finally, sending things from geographical regions severely affected by COVID-19 can be hampered. Preparation and response plans for an infectious disease can be used to guide protective measures.
Plans focus on levels of risk associated with different workplaces and work-related tasks, including the source of contact, risk factors arising from the range of home and society, and the personal risk factors for employees, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address those risks and plans to be prepared for situations that may occur as a result of the outbreak of the disease.
The preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
The objectives of the response to the outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business activities, and reducing adverse effects on other companies that are in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses received.
The cyclical structure of risk control is a structure that is widely used in occupational safety and health function control.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be overcome, the most effective controls are engineering control, then administrative control, and finally personal safety equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related risks without relying on the behavior of employees, and it can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work-related policies or procedures that require action by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but it can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risk of the worker, as applicable, to fit properly (such as the respirator), to be constantly and properly worn, to regularly inspect, maintain and replace, and to properly open, clean and store or cancel to avoid pollution.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States, people and other colleagues have minimal professional contact with people at low risk of exposure.
The basic measures to prevent infection recommended for all workplaces include frequent and well-maintained handwashing, encouraging staff to stay at home if they are sick, providing respiratory care, including face coverings during sneezing and coughing, keeping tissues and garbage containers clean, telecommunication or disinfecting equipment to be used at different times of the day, personnel preparing for other work,
An essential step in keeping employees, customers, interviewers and others safe in the workplace is to quickly identify and separate potentially infectious individuals.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home, as long as they are free from fever, fever marks, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying medications, and should be flexible about the policies of sick leave, which allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member, and allow employees to stay at home.
According to OSHA, the medium-risk jobs in contact include those jobs where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but people who are recently infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the ongoing disease spread among the public in the workplace or in places where the person is widely spread COVID-19 may need to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (1.8 m) in close proximity.
Those employees include those who have public contact with, such as schools, high-density work environments, and those in the workforce who are trained in the field of COVID-19 to be trained in the field of COVID-19, are trained in the field of health and safety in the field of personnel who are trained in the field of COVID-19, and are trained in the field of personnel in the field of personnel who are trained in the field of health care, who are trained in the field, and in the field of the personnel who are in the personnel who are exposed to the other people in the personnel, and in the workforce to be in the personnel in the personnel, and in the personnel in the personnel in the personnel in the person in the needs to be in the person in the person in the way, and in the needs of the needs to be in the needs to be in the needs to be in the needs of the personnel, are in the in the in the personnel in the in the in the in the personnel in the in the in the in the in the in the personnel, and in the needs of the person in the needs of the needs of the person in the needs of the needs of the person in the needs of the profession, to be exposed to be in the profession, to be in the needs of the profession, are in the person in the profession, to be in the person in the needs of the profession in the person in the profession, and in the needs of the profession in the profession in the profession in the in the needs of the needs of the needs to be in the needs of the profession in the profession in the needs of the profession in the in the in the in the in the in the in the profession, to be in the person in the profession in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the profession, and in the way, to be in the in the needs of the in the in the profession in the profession in the profession, to be in the needs to be in which are in the profession in the profession, to be in the profession in the needs of the needs to be in the needs of the needs to be in the profession in the in the needs of the in the in the in the in the in the profession in the profession in which there in the needs of the needs of the way, and in the needs to be in the needs of the person in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in which are in the in the in the in the in the in which are in which there in which there in which there in the needs of the needs, and in the in the person in the way, and in the needs to be in the needs to be in the needs to be in the way, to be in the person in the person in the needs of the way, and in the needs to be in the needs to be in the needs to be in the needs to be in which are in the needs, and in which are in the needs, and in the needs to be in the in the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs to be in which are in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the person in which are in the person in the needs of the needs of the person in the profession in the person in which are in the person in the way, to be in the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the in the needs of the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in the in which are in the needs of the needs of the needs of the way, to be in the person in the needs of the person in the person in the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the needs of the profession, and in the person in which there in which are in the person in the profession.
Employees in this risk group need to use the respirator in rare cases.
If a person gets sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect staff and other passengers include separating sick people from others at a distance of 6 feet, specifying a member of the staff to serve the sick person, and providing a face mask to the sick person, or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissues while coughing or coughing.
Cabin crews should wear disposable medical gloves when responding to the call of the sick traveler or when touching the body fluid or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly use additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has fever, persistent cough or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other recyclables should be discarded in an organic risk bag, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial vessels including amusement ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include travel delays if sick, keeping themselves isolated, and informing the ship’s medical center immediately if there are any fever or other symptoms while on board.
In ideal cases, a person who has been quarantined should have a medical follow-up in the cabin. In case of school and child care facilities, regardless of infection in the public, if an infected person enters the school building, the CDC recommends a short-term closure to clean or disinfect it.
When the disease spreads to a minimum to a moderate level in public, strategies to maintain social distancing may be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, gatherings, and other huge gatherings, such as physical education or eating in gathering music classes or cafeterias; increasing the distance between desks, separating the hours of visits to the office and vacations, and limiting the availability of a healthful visitor to children.
When the disease spreads to a large extent in the local community, additional schoolworks of social distancing strategies may be considered to increase. Law enforcement personnel performing daily routine activities are considered to have a lower health risk by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to communicate with people who are suspected of or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If employees come into close contact during the time of fear, in that case they should be cleaned and disinfected using a household cleaning spray or wipe before reusing their duty belts and equipment, and the evidence management method for controlling and discarding the used PPE should be followed.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and death-related services staff to be at high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk jobs in contact include healthcare supplies, support, laboratories, and medical transport workers who come into contact with patients who are known or suspected to have COVID-19.
If employees perform aerosol-producing procedures, or collect or circulate samples from patients who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, they become at higher risk of exposure.
Aerosol-producing methods include inserting a tube, coughing initiation methods, bronchoscopy, collecting samples by entering some dental procedures and tests or materials.
High-intensity, death-related jobs include personnel involved in preparing the bodies of people who were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of their death; it becomes very high-intensive if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for people with these risky groups include performing COVID-19 when it is known or suspected to be isolated to patients.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be suitable in some healthcare and hobby environments.
Samples should be handled according to the biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated to individual waiting areas based on whether they are suspected to have COVID-19. OSHA recommends respirators other than PPE for people who are known to have SARS-CoV-2 or are suspected to be working within 6 feet of those who have had SARS-CoV-2 and those who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, including health tests, training, and medical tests, NIOSH-approved N95 or improved filtering facepiece resistor must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve employee comfort. WHO Coverall does not recommend, since COVID-19 does not spread through physical fluid components, but rather is a respiratory disease.
The WHO recommends a surgical mask only for screening staff at the entrance.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shields, gowns and gloves for those who are collecting or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-producing procedures.
If an aerosol-producing process is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 receptor.
Given the inadequacy of PPE supplies worldwide, WHO recommends using physical insulators such as telemedicine, transparent windows to reduce the need for PPE, and those who are directly involved in caring have only one person with COVID-19 who has not been in contact with the patient who has been in the care of the patient, only to be allowed to visit the emergency room, and to use the necessary PPE for specific work, while caring for multiple patients with the same disease.

We are in a very good situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a global phenomenon that manifests universal human interconnection and our responsibilities to each other.
We have no precedent for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the universal sympathy, cooperation and social fabric at the heart of this organization.
The intimacy, trust, and care we have seen through emails, calls and chats among all our colleagues is a significant reward for the incredible people we are fortunate enough to work with.
I am very grateful and proud to have you all as a partner.
Last week someone exchanged his appreciation for our work with me.
They reminded me of how important it is to be able to see Wikipedia for the world right now, and how powerful it is to have this important resource available online and to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, whether it's to keep the sites open, or to pay our colleagues or to keep our communities safe, no matter what.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now at a much higher level than ever before.
It is a moment where not only what we do, but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some significant changes this week in the way we work together.
Keeping up with our work and schedules
Just like Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our approach and set a schedule for the coming days and months.
We thought of the appropriate response to the situation we were facing, and at that time we considered the best way to sustain the company.
Most of us wanted to get rid of stress and support our purpose for a long time.
If you need to back up the dial, there is no problem.
For all employees, contractors, and contractual employees:
Our daily working expectations will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not announcing a holiday - if you're able to work in a more normal time, the mission can put you to work.
But at the moment the world is uncertain, and whether you need to take care of your loved one or bring groceries or go to the doctor, your well being is our priority.
We are not looking at your time.
Don't work if you're sick.
That's important, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or PTO is required - just tell your manager and help your team correct the calendars and schedules, to make sure the core areas of work are covered.
(If you are positive for COVID-19, please inform T&C Ops' Brian to help and ensure that your situation receives due attention from the authorities).
Full-time employees will be paid.
We have already said, and we are reaffirming our commitment to our contractors and our hourly working colleagues.
They will be paid based on their working hours in normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use work as a way to drive their stress from the world around us to a certain direction.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially at such a time.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We want you to keep in touch with your manager, so that we know what to expect and adapt accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we need to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising Teams (among others) perform essential tasks that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all our departments to assess the current goals and change our focus to cooperate with what is needed for our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, only we will focus on the most important projects.
If you work slowly, you won't get hurt.
We don't plan to double-time work after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to complete the work within a deadline, which is no longer realistic.
We acknowledge that the situation has changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines where appropriate.
What's going on with the annual report?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we also want to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which gives employees more time to prepare budgets to prioritise essential work, take care of themselves, and give loved ones the opportunity to take care of themselves, at the same time accepting the demands of those people who want to work on a reduced schedule for the next few weeks or need to do so.
This extension of the timeline greatly reduces the pressure on the current planner and the entire organization.
We will submit our proposal to the board next week and we will update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as possible as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office status, contact and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have come into contact with the COVID-19 virus.
But with a lot of caution, we hired a virus-resistant cleaning staff team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a virus-resistant solution to disinfect each surface and lobby and elevator banks entering our floor.
The building is employing its own maintenance responsibility protocol user products that help in the safety of their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has its COVID-19 protocol exchanged with us and with all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office moved to a completely remote setup in line with the instructions given to San Francisco.
Some of our NYC-based colleagues know that we were also discussing taking a place lease in Brooklyn.
The debate continues, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-distance colleagues knew that it could be adjusted, and wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of the meeting to one or two hours if too much.
If longer sessions are needed, consider how they can be divided into smaller portions over a few days.
Explain the meeting clearly, keep an agenda and send texts in advance.
With tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connectivity, default the video.
Put a lead to make each meeting easier, ask someone to observe questions in a chat and keep an eye on the speaker list, and ask someone to write notes (or take notes collaboratively).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to Tech Support.
Use your snippets for snippets.
Join the <0x23>remotees channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR workmanship team is focusing on webinar-based argonomics guidelines to help increase foundation-wide distributed work.
Last week, we asked all community donors to cancel public events such as Editathon, funded by Wikimedia, until the WHO declared the pandemic to be over.
We inform them that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible for them to complete their agreed grant activities and that no one will be punished for delaying or modifying these goals.
In the coming weeks, we will be incentivizing additional guidance for Wikimedia and other regional and subject-oriented community conferences.
There seems to be depression for disturbing the general attitude of the entire global community, but at the same time, both in the ability and clarity of the Wikimedia community to pay attention to their own people.
CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki in the coming days, to provide a place for the public to observe the effects and follow our contacts with them.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
In this situation, we are all united and will help as much as we can.
You can continue to search for information from this email in the middle of the day, and get other vital information related to COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with the workers currently living in significantly affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workstream or coverage challenge, or if you need help with anything else, please let us know and don't hesitate to work with CRT.
We are here to assist and coordinate as needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive issues, please email Brian Judan, director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a disincentive to our work and responsibilities.
It is a recognition that at this moment our actions and responsibilities may have to be adapted in a way that we have not done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need for our movement, and provide the services the world relies on.
When the time comes, our planned work will wait for us.
Now is the time to help each other and create space for the important work that is going to come in the coming weeks and perhaps even months.
To do this, you need everyone's cooperation, and so we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be healthy when you need it.
Now, please - wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Dorian D, Gregory V, Haime V, Joel L, Linette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Hayme V, Jenin U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Tony S).
B'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestinal cells (cell membranes).
ACE2 inhibits the work of the associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II, and increases ang(1-7) making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a place of entry into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin-modifying enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloanium that lies on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and a C-terminal colctin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, whose active space in the action of the enzyme is dissipated on the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The outermost domain of ACE2 is divided from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as Shadows and as a result the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released through the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly connected to the membrane of the cells related to the lungs II type of alveolas, small intestine anterocytes, most of the organ arteries and venous endothelial cells, and the arterial chikungunya is attached to the muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA expressions are also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and breastme.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as the counterbalance of ACE.
ACE angiotensin I divides hormones into Vasoconstriction angiotensin II.
ACE2 separates carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis it into Vasodilator Angiotensin (1-7) (H-AVal-Pr)
ACE2 can distinguish a few other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dierophine A and grelin.
ACE2 regulates the exchange of membranes of neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is associated with heart disease.
ACE2 as a transmembrane protein serves as the main point of entry into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that is responsible for SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that is responsible for COVID-19).
More precisely, it is said that binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 into the enzymatic domain of ACE2 to the surface of the cell resulted in the displacement of endocytosis and endometriosis between both the cells and viruses and enzymes.
This entry process also requires the priming of S protein by host serine protease TMPRSS2, its inhibition is under current investigation as a potential healer. It has helped some to speculate that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help fight infections.
However, a number of professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of proof ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that ""compared to regulation, the risk of pneumonia was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the use of ACE inhibitors."""
"Moreover, ""the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, especially those with high risk of pneumonia and those with heart failure."""
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality rates, although its results were lower than that of the overall risk of pneumonia."""
Recombinant Human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a fancy therapy for acute lung damage and appeared to improve the pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation of the pig's baby with symptoms of lipolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the work begins in 30 minutes, also the duration of the effect (stability) is 24 hours.
Different extracts suggest that people who cannot tolerate first-class renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or have an illness where angiotensin II is increased infestation may have rheumatic rheumatoid arthritis. Symptoms of acute respiratory illness (acute relapse) may show hope for rheumatoid rheumatoid arthritis.
"B'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications that are designed to identify identity as a response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying a person (""identity"") who is in contact with an infected person."
Numerous applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in some areas and jurisdictions.
A number of infrastructures have been created to create communication detection apps.
Privacy concerns have been expressed, especially about systems that work on the basis of identifying the geographical location of the app users.
The relatively inaccessible access options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log in to other cellphones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would directly integrate the functionality of supporting such Bluetooth-based apps into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has launched an application in conjunction with Alipay that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used across more than 200 Chinese cities. An app called TraceTogether is used in Singapore.
The app has created a local information technology group, it has been published as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia "stop Corona!", a Bluetooth-based app that has launched aimed at detecting the symptoms of a potential infected person and providing quick response to health care authorities.
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app has been waiting for approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government announced that the connection search app is in the advanced stage of development and will be available to work within a few weeks. A similar app (""StopCovid"") has been planned in Ireland and France."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia is planning to launch a geofencing app for patients suffering from COVID-19 disease in Moscow, to ensure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including a lack of functionality if the results are positive and app acceptance is limited to a small portion of the population.
"Regarding concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful ""Coronavirus"" apps, Apple has set limits on which types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store by limiting only to ""government"" or otherwise named companies."
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Those who promote privacy expressed their concerns about the implications of surveillance on the public using coronavirus apps, in particular, whether surveillance infrastructures designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be eliminated after the threat is gone.
Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations have issued a statement calling for limiting such surveillance.
The company announced eight conditions regarding the government project:
"The observer must be ""legal, necessary and proportionate""."
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> Must have sunsets to enhance monitoring and monitoring;
The use of data for COVID-19 should be limited.
The protection of information and unknown identity must be protected and demonstrated on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance had to be done to stop the spread of discrimination and marginalisation;
The sharing of data with third parties must be made clear in the law;
Citizens should have the right to protest against abuse and protection against abuse.
"All ""relevant stakeholders"", including public health experts and marginal groups, will require significant participation. The German KOES Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Border (Reporter Ohnne Grenzen) (RSF) have issued checklists."
The purpose of the proposed Google/Apple plan is to solve the problem of static surveillance by removing them from the operating systems of their devices if they are no longer needed.
Some countries used surveillance over network-based locations instead of apps, which eliminated both the need to download the app and the ability to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, network-based identification was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to inaccurate location information have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems in the central server require access to personal location data; multiple privacy protection systems have been created that use the central server only for interconnection (see section below).
An appless system was used in South Korea to monitor contacts.
Instead of using an employed app, the system collected tracking data from various sources, including data from transactions in mobile device tracking's data and cards, and combined them to send notifications to potentially infected individuals via text messages.
In addition to using this information to warn of possible contacts, the government has made location information available to the public, in which certain issues were approved due to far-reaching changes to the Information Privacy Act following the outbreak of MERS.
This information is available to the public through many apps and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using both centralized and privacy-protected systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been released.
Identifying privacy-protected communication with a real part of research education that began at least 2013 is a well-established idea. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as recording proximity to another cellphone user using Bluetooth low energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a combination effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and is not a single behavioral code. Decentralized behavior codes include decentralized privacy-preserving proximity detection (DP-PPT/DP-3T), interconnected temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact numbers, and CEN), mobile communication identification (CEN).
In these protocols, identifiable personal information never leaves the device and occurs within all matching devices.
MIT Media Lab is developing the privacy group SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-protected strategies when collecting and using location or route interception data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on a white paper titled ‘Applications That Have Been Cheated: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic’ (Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic), which was published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace Platform by Enigma MPC, the MIT-based company.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities, without compromising the privacy of information.
On April 5, 2020, the Universal TCN Alliance was established by some teams that aim to reduce division and enable universal interoperability to identify and alert apps, which were assembled on a core aspect of widespread adoption, including those that were essentially the same procedures and the supersessional behaviors of bigmoves that were necessary.
On 9 April 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it has a free-sourced BlueTrace protocol that is being used by its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced an initiative to find people in touch, which will protect privacy as they claim, based on a mix of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also released details of the main technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be available in three stages:
To enable governments to create privacy-protecting official apps to detect coronavirus, roll-out of tools
Integration of this functionality directly to iOS and Android: Google and Apple first distribute the system via the operating system update and later plan to solve the tech-up and constant surveillance problems by removing it in the same way when disaster strikes.
B.Drug Repositioning (also known as re-profiling, re-profiling, new action-promoting, or a medication that changes to remedial drugs) is an approved drug that is primarily used to treat diseases or disorders that are different from those for which the disease has been developed.
This is a path to scientific research that is currently being followed for the development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.
Other research guidelines include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the development of convalescent plasma infections. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-specific proteins each of which has multiple ligament binding sites.
By analyzing these binding sites, it provides a reasonable project to make effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are Papine National Proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Helicase, S protein and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain A. A., and others studied various candidate compounds that were adapted and analyzed in its pre-clinical research for the similarity of the skeletons of candidates by the most similar approved drugs to intensify the development of a powerful SARS-CoV-2 drug to recommend clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a malaria-resistant drug that is also used against some auto-immune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs to be studied as part of the Solidarity diagnostic test.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that tests for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the state of New York will begin on March 24. The FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under emergency use authorization (EUA) on March 28.
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is only approved as an emergency treatment for patients who are hospitalized under the European Union but are not able to participate in the clinical trial.
"The CDC said that the ""use, dosage or durability of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection"" has not yet been proven."
"The doctors said they were using the drug ""because there is no other alternative""."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
A large-scale research is being carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"The Chinese clinical trials of Wuhan and Shenzhen demanded that Favipirabi be shown to be ""clearly effective""."
The results of 35 patients in Shenzhen were negative in the middle of 4 days, while the length of illness was 11 days for 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia organized in Wuhan, half were given favipiravir and half were given umifenavi.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug was inadequate and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy drugs from Japan to stockpile, and that the military would be used to supply drugs to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Sinzo Abe has proposed to the Trump administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in cases of acute illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those who are trying to conceive.
"A combination of antiviral drugs of Lopinavir and Ritonavir, a study of Lopinavir/Retonavir (Kaletra) concluded that ""no benefits were observed."""
Medications were planned to prevent HIV from being replicated by binding into proteins.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to change drugs to find a compound that will build a relationship with the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism among scientific society about using resources to change the purpose of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lopinavi/Retonavir in the international mutual support test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus-borne diseases and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in-vitro against multiple filo-, pneumonia-, paramexo- and corona-viruses.
One of the problems of antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and infections.
A few preliminary pre-trial studies indicate that remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to prevention. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with additional serious illnesses.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C for hospitalization and veins for people with severe COVID-19; two are placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began a trial for antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan plans to conduct a clinical trial for the corticosteroids taken by the respiratory tract to treat pre-tested patients with novel coronavirus.
A type of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is being tested in Denmark, Germany and Austria with serious, hospitalized 200 patients to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORNA, was taking 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that were not required to be hospitalized.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not have an effective contraceptive method, are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, encouraging the Italian Medicine Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-disciplinary study on the use of anoxaperin sodium in preventative and palliative medicine on 300 patients was announced on April 14 in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, systematic scientific attention has been focused on reconstitution of approved anti-toxic drugs that were developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Rabavirin: Rabavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with China's 7th edition guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially new-use for the treatment of COVID-19 are:
Tosilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Trials are also being conducted in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab <0x23>COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a pro-proposed vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been completed, several efforts are in progress to create such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was not expecting the vaccine to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, there were five vaccine candidates in Phase I safety research.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to substantial investment and research activities to produce a vaccine.
Many companies are using released genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was said that the CEPI initiative's condition for vaccine production is speed, production capacity, massive application and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were working for research and development in early 2020 to create effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platform goals that have advanced to Stage I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus-borne carriers (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: cansino biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccinated individuals are in the early stages of improvement, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others, but all of them are slightly derived from the information published in the public domain.
Phase I-II tests conduct primary safety and immunity tests, and are usually performed on arithmetic, placebo-controlled, and multiple sites when determining a more precise, effective dose.
Phase III trials, including vaccine testing effectiveness and control groups, usually involve more participants, while on the other hand, monitoring adverse effects on optimal drug levels.
"From 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as confirmed earlier as April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated (yet under ""preparative"" research)."
Around January 24, 2020, Queensland University in Australia announced that it was investigating the feasibility of a molecular enclosed vaccine that would genetically correct viral proteins to trigger immune response.

CEPI's other investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Innovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have started testing six different vaccine candidates on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they were preparing a self-enhancing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was made within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced <0x24>275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical defense against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian institutions and universities, such as the initiative of the University of Medicago and Saskatchewan.

"On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing a potential COVID-19 vaccine called PittCoVac on rats, which states that ""the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines extracted by MNA are strong antigen-specific antibodies that were tested at the beginning of the two weeks after [in rat cases]."
On 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced plans for a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a possible nasal spray.
DNA will be designed using bacteriophage to replicate inside the human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities created integrated resources to gain access to supercomputers from IBM, in conjunction with the Hublet Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they can be beneficial beyond the diseases that prevent them.
An additional 4,170 health care workers are being enrolled for an extra-invasive trial in Australia.
There is a possibility that vaccines that are under development will not be safe or effective.
Early research into assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine in animal models such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other animals in the laboratory and non-human mammals indicates the need for biosafety-level 3 control levels and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures for managing living viruses.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world. There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When the outbreak of MERS occurred, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a suitable template for preparing vaccines and vaccines against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed the first clinical trials in humans and three more are ongoing, all of which are viral-vector vaccines, two adenoviral-vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and an MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory where it is claimed that the virus that was behind COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents mentioned in various social media posts are related to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other types of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
B'coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the Civic Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can last from two to fourteen days.
Although mild symptoms are common in most cases, in some cases their progress can lead to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have recovered. The virus is most often transmitted to humans through tiny toothpicks caused by coughing, sneezing, or talking during initial close contact.
When the dust particles are produced during exhalation, they usually fall on the ground or on the surface rather than spread over long distances.
People can get infected by touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days of symptoms beginning, although it is more likely to spread before symptoms are revealed and at a later stage of the disease. The ideal method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the nasopharyngeal swab.
Masks are recommended for those suspected to be infected with the virus.
The recommendations of the general public are different, some authorities are recommending against their use, some are recommending their use, and others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be symptomless or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and vomiting of the mouth or lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Relatively less common, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, watering with the nose, or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea, and diarrhoea have been shown to vary by percentage.
Some of the cases in China were initially just heart attacks and heart attacks.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, multi-gang disability, and death.
This is known as the stage of bacterial growth.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms will see it within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that symptoms are not visible in everyone who is infected.
The role of these symptomless carriers in the case of infection is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may have a role to play in the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected individuals whose symptoms have not been observed is currently unknown and is being studied, according to a report by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), that 20% of all confirmed cases were symptomatic while in hospital.
On April 1, the National Health Commission of China began to include symptomatic patients in its daily cases; 130 of the 166 infected people (78%) were symptomless during testing.
Both red and white can carry a greater number of viruses.
It's easier to speak than to speak normally.
A study in Singapore found that small droplets can spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) as a result of not covering the face.
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has hinted that bioarosol infections may be possible and air collector kept in the outside hallways of people's homes gave a positive sample of the viral RNA.
Some medical methods such as intubation and cardiopulmonary regeneration (CPR) can lead to airborne expansion.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the stool, this risk is considered low. The virus is most likely to be touched when symptoms appear in humans; the risk may be low before symptoms become clear.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but a person usually infects two to three people. The virus survives on the surface for several hours to a few days.
In particular, up to one day on cardboard, the virus was found to be identifiable in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days and 99% in copper for up to four hours.
It varies depending on temperature and humidity.
Soaps and detergents can also be effective if used properly; the products of the subnet break down the fatty protection level of the virus, make it deactivated, and release them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorooxydine gluconate (assay-related disinfection) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken between two days after the start of hospitalization.
The first sample of five out of six patients showed the most complete of the virus and the sixth showed the most complete of the virus when tested on the second day.
Civic Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to Wuhan's acute respiratory illness group.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus can be seen in coronaviruses that are related in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in domestic soap, which cracks its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 has a close relationship with the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus enters the tissue cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that is abundant in the lung type II alveolar cells.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called ""spike"" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 to enter the host cell."
About 12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, were found to have severe cardiac injuries and are more frequent in severe diseases.
Cardiovascular symptoms are higher due to systemic inflammatory reactions and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but severe myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors move quickly to the heart and are involved in heart action.
ICU patients with COVID-19 infection have seen thrombocytosis (31%) and Venus thromboembolism (25%) and may be related to weak prognosis. Body-testing of people who died of COVID-19 has been shown to be involved in the damaged alveolar (diffuse alveolardamage),
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tendency to move towards the respiratory tract linking epithelial cells -ACE2, acute COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells in COVID-19 patients have been found to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-discharged monocytes and severe lung pathology rejuvenation (recruitment).
Lymphocytic infiltrate has been reported in the body's examination.
The WHO has published a number of testing protocols for the disease.
The ideal method of testing is to use reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test is usually carried out in respiratory samples obtained by the nezoferengel swab; however, nasal swab or sputum samples can also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be done, but these require two blood samples to be taken within a gap of two weeks, and the results have a low immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and release the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could develop a unique polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to detect infection by the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and detect whether a person has been infected in the past) were in preparation for development, but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience in testing showed only 60 to 70% accuracy.
On 21 March 2020, the FDA approved the first spatial respiration test for use in the U.S. by the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University recommends diagnostic features and infection detection methods based on pandemic-related risks.
Bilateral, multilober ground-glass opacity with an edged, uneven and backward distribution is common in early infections.
Depending on the progression of the disease, subplural predominance, irregular paving (modifying the lobeular septal rejuvenation) and integration can be seen.
There is very little information available about pathophysiology and microscopic lesions of COVID-19.
The main pathological data of the autopsy investigation are:
Macroscopy: Puluricy, Pericarditis, Long Consolidation (Flower Water Catching) and Pulmonary Soothing
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Light pneumonia: the formation of intermittent inflammation and multinucleated monster cells with pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large-scale atypical pneumocytes, lymphocytic infiltration
Severe Pneumonia: Damaged Dispersed Alveolar (DAD) with distilled alveolar excretion material.
The causes of acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia are DAD.
Pneumonia Sarano: the organization of extracts in the alveolar cavity and the interstitial fibrosis related to the lungs
Blood: Dispersed Intravascular Glucose Dam (DIC); Leukocyrethroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include sitting at home, avoiding crowded places, frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and not touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommended Dhaka with mouth and nose tissue during coughing or sneezing and recommended using the inner side of the elbow if no tissue is found.
Proper hygiene of the hands is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends using cloth face coverings in public to limit transmission parts by people with no symptoms. Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce exposure to people infected with large-scale groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling huge public gatherings.
Instructions for maintaining distance include that people will be at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away.
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. Since no vaccine is expected until 2021, the key part of COVID-19 control is to try to lower the pandemic peak, it is known as ""straight plane""."
The CDC also advises people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if the hands are apparently dirty, before eating and after a nose shake, cough or sneezing.
It further recommends the use of at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers only when soap and water are not available. In places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
The activation of antimicrobials in these preparations originates from ethanol or isopropyl.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is ""not an active substance for hand antiseptics""."
Glycerol is added as a humicant.
Humans are driven by supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other affected critical organs.
The CDC recommends that those who are suspected to be carrying the virus wear a normal mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of respiratory dysfunction, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve the immune system.
Assistive treatment may be effective for people with similar symptoms in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have released recommendations to take care of people with COVID-19 who are hospitalized.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have organized the treatment recommendations of various organizations at the Free Resources, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for early use.
Caution must be exercised to reduce the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare environments when procedures such as intubation or hand ventilation are performed that can create airborne particles.
For healthcare professionals serving people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping people in the airborne infection isolation room (Airborne Infection Isolation Isolation Room, AIIR) in addition to using evidence warnings, touch warnings and airborne warnings. The CDC has described the instructions for using Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the global pandemic.
The recommended tools are: PPE gowns, respirators or facemasks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators (rather than facemasks) are recommended.
The N95 Respirator is approved for the industry environment, but the FDA has approved masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
These are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness against certain biological elements is not guaranteed for label-specific use.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends using a mask made at home as a last resort.
Most cases do not have severe COVID-19 enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but some cases are severe enough.
Intubation can be avoided with the help of high-flow nasal cannula or by-level positive airway pressure, with some evidence that respiratory support is being actively studied for people hospitalized with COVID-19-related respiratory failure.
It is not known if either of these two will lead to the same benefit for those who are seriously ill.
Some doctors choose to keep it through if the invasive mechanical ventilate is available because this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to the nasal canula of the high flow. Serious cases are most common in older adults (who are over 60 years old and especially over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of health management to deal with the sudden increase in the number of serious COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people infected with COVID-19 in hospitals are finally admitted to the ICU.
In COVID-19, acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS) develops and mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as oxygenation becomes increasingly inconvenient.
To maximize oxygen distribution requires pressure control modes and high PEEP-enabled ventilators, on the other hand the ventilator needs to reduce the risk of related lung injuries and pneumothorax.
High levels of PEEP may not be found in older ventilators.
Possible medical research began in January 2020 and a number of antiviral drugs are being tested.
Remdesivi seems to be the most optimistic.
Although new drugs may take up to 2021 to be manufactured, a number of drugs that are under testing are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with serious diseases.
The WHO proposed volunteers will participate in the trial of potential medical efficacy and safety. The FDA has granted temporary approval to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment where a person’s life is in serious or immediate danger.
It has not been studied to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'near contact' using surveillance data and consequently the potential risk of infection.
Each user can check the status of the other three users.
The app not only recommends self-quarantine when potential risks are detected, it also warns local health officials. Cellphone data is used to monitor infected people and people in contact with South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, using Big Data Analytics, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measures were taken to protect and enforce quarantine for people who may have come in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also distributed information on the unified phone location to the German federal government agency Robert Kacch Institute for research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to identify the Quarantine breaker.
"Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said the mobile phone operators told him that ""40% of people are walking around anyway""."
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonia's President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for a global call for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel ill because of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or the fear of self-infection.
"The BBC cited Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Augmented social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress, and economic recession are a perfect disaster for people's mental health and well-being."""
The disease, similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as common colds, can progress smoothly with little or no symptoms.
Smaller cases usually recover within two weeks, but it may take three to six weeks for patients with severe or severe diseases to recover.
Pregnant women may be at risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on information from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but there is a lack of COVID-19 information. In some humans, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia and damage the lungs.
In the majority of severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly increase acute respiratory illness syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory dysfunction, septic shock, or multi-angle disability.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clots and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Among those hospitalized with COVID-19, the abnormality of blood circulation in 6%, especially the increase in the duration of the prothrombin, has been clarified, while abnormal kidney activity has been observed in 4% of the group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have seen an increase in carcinogens (transamines).
According to the same report, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, including five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a seven-day interval between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the median time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full six to 41-day period.
According to a survey by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the male mortality rate was 2.8%, while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of the lung samples show the loss of diffuse alveolar, including the cellar fibromyalgia excretion in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocyte.
The picture of the lungs is similar to acute respiratory illness syndrome (Acuate Respiratory Disorder Syndrome, ARDS).
11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China were marked by heart damage due to an increase in cardiac arrest or troponin levels.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing conditions. The socioeconomic status of an area and the availability of medical facilities can also affect mortality.
The mortality rate varies not only due to regional differences but also due to systemic difficulties.
The mortality rate of mild cases can be calculated in excess.
However, the real fact is that death is the result of an infection in the past, which means the current mortality rate is being underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and 2.4 times more likely to require or die of intensive care. Concerns have been raised about the long-term consequences of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital authorities targeted a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity among some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans indicated organ damage.
It can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether past infections provide effective and long-term immunity among people recovering from the disease.
The chances of immunity are very high based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but in those cases, recovery from COVID-19 has been reported after the results of a later positive test of the coronavirus.
These cases are feared to be more of a permanent deterioration than re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has an animal source, through an increased spread of infection.
The actual source is unknown, but the spread of the infection by December 2019 was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, The Lancet, was published in January 2020, where the first date for the onset of symptoms was reported as 1 December 2019.
The initial onset of symptoms was announced by the WHO on December 8, 2019.
A number of measures are usually used to determine the death rate.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, the alternative to treatment, the time taken since the initial outbreak, and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of WHO 2019, the laboratory specified the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 due to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in the lab to indicate the death toll due to COVID-19 to a COVID-19 medicated number of cases. The U07.2 code specified the time of death and incidence ratio (death-
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the worldwide death and case fatality ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other systems include Case Fatality Rate, CFR, which identifies the percentage of those diagnosed with the disease, and the mortality rate (Infection Fatality Rate, IFR), which is the percentage of those infected (not diagnosed and diagnosed) who have died.
These statistics do not have a specific time frame and follow a specific population from infection to diagnosis of the infection.
Although antibodies are not produced in all infected people, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
The epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, casiglione deadda, a small village of 4600 people, where 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spreads through the Carnival Festival and spreads among younger people, causing relatively low deaths, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been officially classified.
Germany's healthcare system has not been affected.
In the Netherlands, blood donors can have about 3% of antibodies as assessed.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died of COVID-19.
The effects of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
The mortality rate among men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women ends in the 90s.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of these gender differences are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, the prevalence of smoking in women is relatively low and the development of co-morbidities in men at a younger age than in women, such as high blood pressure may play a role in higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
Since April 2020, the U.S. government has not been monitoring gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral illnesses such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are more likely to come in contact with women and their viruses.
"On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the disease would be officially named ""COVID-19""."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI is the virus, D is the disease, and 19 is when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid specific geographical locations (e.g., China), animal species or human groups, in line with international recommendations for naming the name for the prevention of Kalimalepan. The virus that causes COVID-19 is referred to as the Civic Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"The WHO uses additional ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""the virus responsible for COVID-19"" to connect to the public."
"Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as ""coronavirus""."
"The virus and the disease were commonly referred to as ""Coronavirus"" and ""Uhan Coronavirus"" during the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China."
According to the WHO's 2015 guidelines regarding the use of virus and disease location in January 2020, the WHO recommended acute respiratory diseases 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV as a temporary name for viruses and diseases.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of power in the standard supply chain, a few digital manufacturers are printing parts of healthcare components such as Nejal Swab and ventilators.
In an example, a ventilator valve in an Italian hospital was unable to deliver it within the required time frame when a local new company tested the manufacturer's product construction and produced the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and rumours about the origins, dimensions, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread quickly online.
It is believed that humans are able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence of replicating the virus between pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is under way by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a "reciprocal support test" to assess the impact of the treatment of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest commitment to efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but various companies are actively creating vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 customers to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are being developed.
First, the researchers focus on creating a complete virus vaccine.
Whether inactive or dead, the purpose of the use of the virus is to eliminate the immediate immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to a specific subunit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the research is focused on the S-Spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme customer.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, innovative strategies for making vaccines).
Testing vaccines from one of these strategies for safety and efficacy will have to be tested. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The virus that causes the disease is contained in a genetic code vaccine that does not damage its transcription. An antibody-dependent increase has been indicated as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials have been going on since April 2020.
Seven tests were already evaluating approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most of China's research is being used for different purposes, and nine Phase III tests on remdesivir across different countries are expected to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was prepared in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Interferon Beatter in Lopina/Repinavir.
In March 2020, there is experimental evidence of efficacy by Remdesivir.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated using experimental drugs of remdesivir.
Phase III diagnostic trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, research needs to be reviewed.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, when the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends taking one gram of medication per day, it is noted that double the amount of this drug can be extremely dangerous and life-threatening.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of medical doctors treating people with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir in terms of COVID-19.
Preliminary information suggests that high doses of ribavirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further vivo studies following a low concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that preparing primary spike protein by transmembrane protein serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
The study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin has serious limitations that prevented the medical community from taking these therapies without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine disaster can be complicated in the next phase of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that the rapid release of cytokine of hydroxychloroquine may have anti-inflammatory properties. After completing a small study, Tocilizumab has been included in the National Health Commission of China’s medical guidelines.
After seeing positive results in people with severe disease, it is undergoing phase 2 non-invasive tests at the national level in Italy.
Blood testing in combination with serum ferritin to identify cytokine catastrophes means preventing the progression of the disease, which is thought to be the cause of death of some infected people.
In 2017, CAR T cell therapy was approved by Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist FDA based on a past-response case study for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause.
To date, there is no irreversible, controlled evidence that Tocilizumab is the effective treatment for CRS.
Those who have recovered from COVID-19 are being investigated as a non-vaccinated method of immunization of refined and dense antibodies produced by the immune system to those who need them.
This technique was tested for SARS with undesirable results.
Viral deactivation is the expected process of special procedures by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other processes such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other types of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of monoclonal antibodies produced, are on the way to development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the fluid parts of the blood taken from the recovered patients, and this virus can be rapidly extended to specific antibodies to the organization.
Coronavirus disease, a class of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's Central Hospital, died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
