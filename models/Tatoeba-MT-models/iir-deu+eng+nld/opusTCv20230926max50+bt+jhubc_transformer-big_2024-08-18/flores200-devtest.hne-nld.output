When a small group of living genies (a small population) is separated from the main population (i.e. if they are moving to a mountain range or river, or if they are moving to a new island so that they cannot move back easily) they will often find themselves in a different environment that they were first.
The new environment will require different resources and different competitive advantages, different facilities or adaptations of the new population, which will require stronger competitors than the existing ones.
The basic population has changed completely, and the basics also require the same adaptation.
As time goes on, the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, and the new population becomes less and less visible.
After all, after a thousand or even millions of years, two populations will appear at a very different rate than the same species.

The proportion of the proportions of this format is called 3:2 (when giving the simplest full-number ratio to be divided into twelve parts for each) is called 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS family of formats) are equivalent or almost predictable to this aspect ratio.

Traffic flow is the study of the interaction between drivers and drivers of different traffic points.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because it is impossible to predict the conduct of a driver with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, the driver is able to operate properly within the appropriate range; thus, there is some reasonable stability in the traffic stream and can be expressed in a broadly mathematical manner.
To better represent traffic flow, there are three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
