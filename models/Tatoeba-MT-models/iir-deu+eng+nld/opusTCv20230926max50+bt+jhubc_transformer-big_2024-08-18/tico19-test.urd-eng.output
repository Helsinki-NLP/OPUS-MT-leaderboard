The total spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK rose sharply between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
Similar trends are showing in the total spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, while the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating at different stages based on the country in all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, hospitals and intensive care units in many countries should increase their preparedness due to the rapid rise in COVID-19 patients as they require intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a large number of cases of unknown causes of pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause agent is the novel coronavirus, now called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, the disease resulting from the infection of SARS-CoV-2 has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date has shown that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e., respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 occurs in the case of a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while in 6% of cases, those experiencing severe illness require extreme care.
The mortality rate of patients admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we will evaluate trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the UK (UK) and compare them with the province of Hubei in China.
We also compare the recent number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, there was a further geographical spread of COVID-19, and the dynamic condition of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is now in line with that country.
The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurovision, the Spartite et al reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO's case definition.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA, reported on January 24, 2020 by three French people returning from Wuhan in Hubei province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK (UK) had reported 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths during today's date from December 31, 2019, out of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
Achieving aggregate data and overall spread of COVID-19 cases
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) data on COVID-19 cases in every country around the world comes from only official sources, updated daily at 8:00 a.m. by the Ministry of Health, National and Regional Health Authorities and the World Health Organization.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them with Italy.
As a result of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated a 14-day cumulative spread of COVID-19 taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period January 1 to March 15, 2020.
We presented the aggregate data of notified cases of each country from 8:00 a.m. on 15th March 2020 compared with Italy during the period 31st January to 15th March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day total spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK has been consistent with the province of Hubei (China) (Chapter 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the total spread of COVID-19 began to increase on February 21 and then the increase increased on February 28, 2020 (inclusive content).
This was mostly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the overall spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK has shown similar growing trends (inclusive content).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and the UK, in parallel with Italy during the period January 31 to March 15, 2020.
It was highlighted that, as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., in just 3 weeks before or less, the total number of cases in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy were first reported.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the overall spread of COVID-19 show that the global pandemic is growing at a comparable pace in all countries.
Despite the fact that countries are at different stages, variations in the national public health response and potentially different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients that must be tested for COVID-19, including cache-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors from the affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which 10 percent of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on admissions of COVID-19 cases in any hospital and/or intensive care unit are available for 6 and 1 cases at the EU/EEA level, respectively (numbers are not shown).
However, recent monitoring data, including the completion of reported cases and the number of deaths, should be collected systematically.
A 2010-11 study showed that there has been a major shift in the availability of intensive care and mid-career beds from 29.2 beds in Germany in Europe and 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that these countries will have less resources like Italy (there are 12.5 intensive care and mid-career beds for every 100,000 population in 2011-2010).
Model screening scenarios related to an increase in health care capacity, estimates of COVID-19 cases in every EU/EEA country and hospitalized in the UK that exceed intensive care beds in excess of <0x3E>90% are associated with concern, provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid concern assessment on COVID-19.
Since EU/EEA countries and specific areas of the UK have so far had cases of measles, and hospitals and intensive care units in general describe the population of the regional region, prioritization of information about cases and intensive care beds facilitates the availability of available numbers of regional units of 2 (NUTS-2).
The current trends from Italy and other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals, and intensive care units must prepare themselves for the continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and an increase in COVID-19 patients, like in Italy's affected areas, requires intensive care.
As a recent ECDC rapid concern assessment, a rapid, active and comprehensive approach is required to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which should be addressed with a change in the mitigation approach from prevention, if it is not implemented prematurely, to recognize the expected rapid increase in the number of cases, and to respond to hospitals.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
Here is a small chance during which countries are more likely to increase their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care providers.
Failure to do so, it is likely that health care system providers in EU/EEA countries will face the need for extreme care due to an increase in patients in the coming days or weeks.
The most severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused by the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has so far affected more than 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 people in China and anywhere in the world, resulting in devastating consequences for humans.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also spread due to bats and cause the same symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it affects older people and women more than men.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications about emerging disease, this article attempts to present a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing research article.
We will cover the basics about preventing epidemics, virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and diseases.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate this dangerous disease.
The spring festival of January 25, 2020 has become an unforgettable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese residents due to the outbreak of the novel viral disease and the urge to stay at home for several weeks.
The virus is highly homologous with coronavirus (CoV), which caused the spread of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and is associated with the disease COVID-19.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to the entire country and about 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported with 40,000 patients recovering as a result of the virus and 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the number 1 enemy of the people" and is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), COVID-19 in less than two months, including its virology, epidemiology, epidemiology, causes, treatment and diagnosis after the first report of January 7, 2020, and which has been determined to isolate several patients, more than 200 papers have been published.
This review attempts to summarize the creative progress in the field of new and fast-paced subject matter.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV, a disease caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS that spread in 2012).
We will talk about what has been learned so far about the diagnosis and prevention of this disease, as well as some other important questions yet.
For humans, CoV has traditionally been considered non-vegetarian pathogens, mainly leading to about 15% of the common low 4%.
However, in this century, we had two very deadly CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the epidemic in China and Saudi Arabia in 2003 and soon spread to many other countries with their mortality, respectively.
This is the third COVID-19 pandemic in human history.
As shown in the form, Figure 1.1, I was first reported to the China National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 about the pneumonia membrane whose sources are unknown.
Seven days later, the sequence of CoVs was released.
The first case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, health care providers reported an infection, which meant it was possible to transfer from person to person.
On January 23, all public transport in Wuhan city was shut down and it was shut down.
The first medical study on the disease on January 24 reported that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is considered the site of the onset of the infection by an unknown animal.
On January 30, the WHO declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
By the time this report came out, the disease had already spread to 50 countries across China and around the world (School.2).
As the situation progresses rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, another latest explanation of the epidemic was stated in the Zelle listed in a multi-disciplinary study (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but especially those aged 65-30 years.
Nearly half (47.7 percent) of those affected were over 50 years of age, very under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 has affected more men than women (0.27/100,000) (0.31/100,000).
COVID-19 was mainly spread across Hobbies and surrounding areas.
The average of the COVID-19 diagnosis was 5 (9-2) days from the start.
The average duration of growth was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The primary tortoise number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
According to the time of mass transportation before the Bihar festival in China, the number of infected people increased rapidly before June 23, 2020.
Patients mortality rate of confirmed cases was %1.44 (%95 Cl:1.10-1.86%) and adjusted mortality of all patients was %3.06 (%95 Cl: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are the subfamily of a large and multicellular virus, which is part of the synthesis of the RNA of the sensor.
They are divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to affect humans.
Malfoy spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the peptides 4 (DPP4) respectively to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then the membrane is fusion.
Viral genetics are released into the cytoplasma, then after the transcription of viral genetics, the genomes form a version of the glucophate with RNA and the new claustrophobic caesidorine, which then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
In Wuhan, more than 99.98 percent of SARS-CoV-2 samples collected from the actual location of the outbreak associated with the Wuhan seafood market were found to have a genetic identity of a new type of beta, respectively.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more common with SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Thanks to the transfer of electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found on the very thin part of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-Lymia of SARS-CoV-2 is more closely related to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV-2, which agrees with the fact that SARS-CoV causes less infections than SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a secret leukemia through orf3b, encoded by orf3b and secreted by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b viral pathogen may play its role in the city and express itself in IFNB, but there is no known active domain or form of orf8.
On February 18, 2020, Zhao et al., reported a complex resolution in the structure of the EM with the amino acid transporter B0AT1 in full length of human ACE2 at 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> Islands.
They found that the complexity, in which the open and closed changes were gathered as a diamer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complexity can bind to two S-spheres, which frame the evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 can be a treatment for drug screening in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original and the Dalai Lama
It is known that, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both starting from bats, have been transmitted to humans through swat cats and camels.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the local representative of SARS-CoV-2, because the new virus is similar to two SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, it is not yet known which middleman has helped to cross the barriers to infect humans, and the path to transition is yet to be explained.
G, et al., had suggested snakes as a virus pathogen from bats to humans, including homologous recovery within the S protein.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, according to a study, have suggested that 99% of the long-synthesized pangolins used in traditional Chinese medicine, ant-eating memes, pegolans, and SARS-CoV-2 found in humans may be a potential intermediate representative of SARS-CoV-2 due to sexual intercourse.
However, the %1 difference of the spread in the two genomes is still a huge difference, as well, waiting for the final results of the comprehensive evidence (School.(School.33).
Most physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV which can live for up to 48 hours in dry environments and less than 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and up to 40%-50% in humidity for 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been reported that, SARS-CoV-2 from the upper vertebrae, and for 30 minutes from a heat of 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C, or from 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, parasitic acid, chloroform, and other fatty germs may not be sensitive to the virus, but the chloride does not activate the virus effectively.
In general, the entire human population lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and that is why they suffer from the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported.
In this way, we may refer to previous studies about other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (School.4).
Usually, when a representative is attacked by a virus, the representative's immune system is characterized by first-type receptors (PRRs), including C-type lactic-like receptors, TLS receptors (TLRs), nad-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through various methods, the mechanisms of virus inflammation, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of the number I-type interferon (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and encourage its viral antigens to accelerate microphage phagocytosis.
However, the N lymphoma of SARS-CoV can help prevent the virus from immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including <0x2B>CD4 and <0x2B>CD8, play an important role in the defense of cells.
T cells of <0x2B>CD4 stimulate B cells to produce specific antibody related to the virus, and <0x2B>CD8's T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
T assistive cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, CoV-T can inhibit the functions of T cells by transmitting epoxy to cells.
Hormonal immunity including C3a and C5a and antibody complements are essential to combat viral infections.
For example, MERS-CoV is neutralized from the antibody separated from the recovered patient.
On the other hand, abuse in the immune system creates many free radicals locally that can damage the lungs and other organs, and, worse, many organs stop functioning and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection has been evident since the onset of clustering, and is more likely to affect older and pregnant women.
This is more common in people who are two to four or whose immune functions are weaker than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the average duration of the growth of SARS-CoV-2 is 14-1 days, mostly 7-3 days.
However, according to a study done on 1,099 cases, the average period of growth is 3 days and from 0 to 24 days.
As noted above, a recent study showed that the growth period based on 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is important for health authorities to set an effective time of quarantine based on the most appropriate period of growth to prevent transmission of the virus to people who are infected but have not shown symptoms.
In general, people infected or infected with the virus need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Often the main and early symptom of COVID-19 is fever, with no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, circulatory pain, headache, knee, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients suffer from respiratory failure and/or shocks a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients with acute respiratory syndrome, septic shocks, metabolic acidity, and immediate improvement in freezing.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even against normal pulmonary imaging, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 found that 98 percent of patients with fever, 76 percent of dry cough, 55 percent of respiratory failure, and 3 percent of patients with diarrhea require ventilator support.
In two recent studies, similar results have emerged about the cause of a tumour through the transmission from the household membrane and non-symptomatic individual.
In comparison, a 2012 study found that patients with MERS-CoV also had basic symptoms of fever (%98), dry cough (4%47), and respiratory failure (5%55).
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, much higher than COVID-19 patients, and MERS more deadly than COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (%26) and throat inflammation (%21).
It has been shown that in patients with SARS, fever (100-99%), dry cough (75-29%), breathlessness (42-40%), diarrhea (25-20%) and throat inflammation (25-13%) are significant symptoms, and about 20-14% of patients needed varicose veins.
As of February 14, when the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2.
By November 2002, the death rate for SARS-confirmed cases was 8,096.
Based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate among 2,494 confirmed cases of MERS was 37%.
A previous study reported that the tortoise number of R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was higher by 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 percent of the R0 of SARS-CoV, while the cumulative range of R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
This table presents a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with symptoms, mortality, and reproductive numbers.
The above data shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less deadly than both later viruses.
Therefore, controlling the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more difficult than the epidemics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Most often the worm begins with the same family, the same family, or the same gathering or ride-like ship.
Often patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas in the past two weeks before the start, or contact with infected people or patients.
However, it has been reported that people can keep the virus inside for up to two weeks without showing symptoms, and patients who have recovered from the hospital can be re-infected with the virus, which calls for an extension of quarantine time.
In these patients, white blood cells were found to be low or equal at the initial level (especially lymphocytes).
For example, the number of white blood cells in the <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/L contains lemophilia, including the number of lymphocytes <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, and the levels of sporadic aminotransferases and vermia were found in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had increased levels of meoglobin in the liver and muscle and blood, and most patients had increased C-inactivated leukemia and atherosclerosis in the blood.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer in the blood, the lack of pharynx, was increased, so the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
The normal features against the radiography of the chest of COVID-19 patients are characterized by blurring on a two-way complex shadow or ground glass in the lungs.
In most patients, common pneumonia, severe lung pain, severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused.
Respiratory syndrome, uncontrollable inflammation, a collection of fluids, and increased fibrous gas exchange are largely compromised.
The inactivity of type I and type II pneumocytes reduces the level of the head duct and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the risk of lung proliferation and their failure.
Therefore, the results of the worst radiographic of the chest are parallel to the extreme range of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, according to SARS and MERS patients, and according to the first pathological analysis of COVID-19, the patient's lungs that died due to the disease contained pneumonia, haelin membrane formation, and intermediate lymphocyte infiltrate, and multicellular cysts.
The use of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was key criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
On February 13, 2020, in China, due to the high rate of negative lying, which can accelerate the epidemic, medical data for diagnosis was started (which is no longer entirely dependent on RT-PCR).
Similar was the case with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, for an effective diagnosis, in the history of the disease, medical explanations, laboratory testing, and radiological results must be of all.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhong Group described a protocol for the use of CRISPR-based shearlock technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which also requires a 100x10-18 microliter/liter to 200x10-18 microliters per hour for detecting RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2.
It is hoped that if confirmed in medical samples, the new technique will dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoVs, mainly therapists can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while similarly trying different treatments that were previously suggested or used for treatment in other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (volunteers).
These methods of treatment include current and potential antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroid, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicines, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of recovered patients was recommended to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in the race to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
Initially, SARS-CoV-2 attacks primarily on the lungs, and perhaps a small amount of other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gut and kidneys.
However, respiratory disorders and lung failure are the biggest risk and leading cause of death for the patient.
Therefore, to help relieve symptoms and save lives, include general oxygen in terms of the severity of the disease, oxygen of the rapid flow, non-interference ventilation, and mechanical interference ventilation.
Patients with severe pain in the respiratory system have to seek help with the use of modified cardio pulmonary bypass techniques to treat the risk of heart attack or respiratory failure, through a faulty corporate oxygen membrane (ECMO).
Additionally, for the care of electrolyte, treatment and prevention of secondary infection and septal trauma are necessary to protect vital organ functions in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is said that the abuse of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS results in cytokine strom.
Cytokine strum is a type of organized inflammatory response that arises from a series of cytokines including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
In order to release a large number of free radicals, which are the major cause of severe pain syndrome and failure of various organs in the respiratory system, these cytokines are added to the immune cells.
Immunosuppression is necessary for the treatment of cytokine strom, especially in severely ill patients.
Corticosteroids and ToCzyzomab have been used in the treatment of cytokine strum.
In the treatment of suppressing other immune groups of cytokine strom; IFN-y,IL-1 and TNF were blocked; JAK was blocked; suppressing of the rhythmic cell 4; and inhibiting HADC, including the instructional modification of the T cell of the immune response.
In SARS, large-scale steroid was used as an immunosuppressor as a treatment to reduce the severity of inflammation loss.
However, heavy doses of steroids were not beneficial in lung disease in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis affects the diagnosis in a dramatic way.
Nevertheless, severe COVID-19 patients have been recommended to use short courses of moderate doses of corticosteroids with caution.
No effective anti-viral treatment has yet been confirmed.
However, with a vaccine remittancer in a U.S. patient with COVID-19, nucleotide analog was found to be effective.
Remittsweeer is a novel antiviral drug, originally developed by Gilled to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, Remittsweeer was also potentially blocked for the prevention of other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gallid provided China with a mix of tests for a couple of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the results of which are much higher than expected.
In addition, baracetinib, interferon-a, lupinavir/retonavir, and raverine have been prescribed for possible treatment for patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms.
In combination with lupinavir/retinovir, treatment may show diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, liver damage, and other negative reactions.
The combination of this treatment with other drugs used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who have recovered from this infectious disease to treat other patients with the disease or to protect healthy ones from the disease.
In fact, most recovered patients have relatively high levels of antibodies against pathogens in the blood.
Antibody is an immunoglobulin (Ig) that helps to fight pathogens and other external objects through B-lemophytes and identify unique molecules on pathogens and directly affect them.
Based on this, plasma from the blood of patients recovering from COVID-19 was collected and admitted to 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms, such as inflammation and viral load and lack of oxygen in the blood, improve in 24 hours.
However, the specific method of treatment has not yet been developed, so it is necessary to confirm and explain it before recommending its use on a large scale.
In addition, along with seeing the effects of the treatment, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should also be considered.
For example, the antibody increases the immune response, and can cause the syndrome of the release of cytokine, which is potentially life-threatening poison.
In general, the number of antibody in the blood is low, and the demand for plasma is high for the treatment of acutely ill patients.
It is difficult to develop a specific antibody so quickly to fight the global epidemic.
Separating B cells from recovered patients and identifying the genetic code to encode an effective antibody against the necessary lesion of the virus is a delicate and difficult process.
In this way, we can speed up the process of antibody preparation.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects largely depend on the composition of multiple components in a formula, which depends on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Many effective ingredients are unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their best combinations.
Currently, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from a severe stage due to a lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19.
For example, Zhu Fan G. Lo capsules and Li Huang Cheng Wen capsules have proven to be effective in treating COVID-19.
In several provinces of China, COVID-19 patients, including Gansu, (63.7%), Nanjia (50%), and Hanan (50%), saw a high rate of improvement in their treatment using traditional Chinese medicine, with 87 percent in their patients, while Hobi Province, which used traditional Chinese medicine in only 30 percent of their COVID-19 patients, had a lower or lower rate of overall health.
However, this is a fairly strict comparison, as the effects of this assessment should include many other factors such as the number and severity of patients.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study on the treatment of Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine in parallel with Western Medicine (WM).
They found that the recovery of body temperature in Western medicine <0x2B> traditional Chinese medicine group compared with only Western medicine group, the elimination of symptoms, and the duration of stay in hospital, was unusually low than the time required.
Very impressively, the symbolic increase in symptoms (severe from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM group only (46.2% compared to 7.4%) and the mortality rate (39%) compared to 8.8%.
However, traditional Chinese medicine is still waiting for more good and control tests of its performance and safety in larger and more centers.
It will be interesting to highlight the procedures for treating traditional Chinese medicine, explaining their effective ingredients or their collection, if possible.
Suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are mostly highly contagious and even fear of deadly disease, and quarantined individuals face boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Moreover, symptoms of infection such as fever, shocks, and cough, as well as negative effects of the treatment such as insomnia, more anxiety, and mental stress can lead to stress.
In the early stages of SARS, a range of psychiatric patients have been reported to have persistent mental stress, anxiety, panic attacks, psychological excitement, psychological symptoms, depression, and self-harm.
Detection and quarantine as part of public health related to the COVID-19 pandemic can make people more anxious and guilty about the impact of conflict, quarantine, and depression on their families and friends.
Similarly, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, as well as those who are in contact with them.
A clear communication should be established with the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and its treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
There must be an effective vaccine to prevent transmission of the virus from animals, and sensitive representatives from infected humans, and antiviral treatments are often necessary to control the emerging virus epidemic.
Efforts have been made to develop S-Lymia-based vaccines against SARS to develop long-term and vitiligo neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity.
A direct impact vaccine was analyzed in animal samples for SARS.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates can't be determined in protecting against the elderly, deadly challenge samples and animal virus infections before medical studies begin.
This is because SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported so far.
On the other hand, in regions other than the Middle East where there are permanent source areas of animal viruses, there is a continuing outbreak of MERS slums.
A vaccine strategy for the prevention of MERS has been developed using subunits of DNA plasma, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viruses such as particles and recovered lemmings, and some of them were tested on animal samples.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-infected people is an urgent and critical task to contain the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome this challenge due to the need for long-term (approximately 18 months) for vaccine production and dynamic mutations of CoVs.
COVID-19 has started showing its medical course in thousands of patients as a novel disease.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without a chain.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with more disease and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, health care agencies must create a diagnostic model of the disease to prioritise their services in low resource areas.
Based on the medical studies so far reported, the following factors may be associated with the diagnosis or impact of COVID-19 patients (table 33).
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is now also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurred to people aged 65-30 years, 47.7% of the 8,866 patients in the study described above were over 50 years old.
Patients with underlying complications have a higher need for intensive care, and are much older than those who do not have complications (aged 66 years rather than 51 years), who treat age as a diagnostic process for COVID-19 patients.
Sex: As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 affects men more than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000).
We have chronic and complexities: Patients with COVID-19 who need extreme care are at risk of severe heart and respiratory attacks.
The most common cause of death in SARS patients is heart attacks.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to positive cholangosite of ACE2, which may cause liver damage in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying disease have a strong relationship and that they can interfere with each other.
Laboratory abnormal results: C-reactive lesion (CRP) levels in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and have been proposed as a possible diagnostic procedure for the treatment and final recovery of the disease.
C-reactive leukemia levels have been suggested for the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19.
Additionally, elevated lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), sprite aminotransferase (AST), ellanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase can also help predict results.
These enzymes are expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and they are released through tissue damage.
So, they are traditional targets of heart or liver damage.
Important medical symptoms: To predict the consequences and complications of COVID-19, a temporary improvement of chest radiography and medical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other tissues.
The use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are commonly used to suppress the immune response to reduce the severity of inflammation loss as an aid in infectious disease.
Since a large amount of corticosteroids were widely used in severe patients with SARS, many survivors suffered from Avascular osteoncerosis with a lifetime disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, a very small amount of steroid should be used in COVID-19 patients for a short period of time.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients suffered from abnormal strains due to prolonged quarantine tolerance and the unexplained death of close family and co-morbid patients.
These patients need to be provided with psychological counseling and long-term support to recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies done so far, COVID-19's epidemiological characteristics seem to be different from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 can also be implanted in the lower respiratory tract, in the upper respiratory tract, and cause mild or no symptoms such as the common cold caused by other CoVs in the early stages of infection.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stage or growth period can produce large amounts of viruses during day-to-day activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission occurs when the patient is severely ill, while not much transmission at the initial stage.
Thus, the current COVID-19 epidemic is far more severe than the SARS epidemic and is quite difficult to control.
At present in China, hopes and efforts are underway to block the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and to disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by keeping the entire population in quarantine.
Although these measures are dramatically damaging the country's economy and other sectors, it is reducing the number of new patients, a sign of slowing the epidemic.
The best part is that the pandemic will end in March and its Dowan Swing phase will be in three to four months.
However, some experts are not so hopeful.
Paul Hunter, et al., has estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be a more contagious disease than SARS, will not be eradicated in 2020.
Ira Lungi et al., set up a model to predict the outcome of the global pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the global population.
A group of Canadians said that both midtribine and throat piercings of patients who had recovered from the hospital two weeks ago showed they were infected with SARS-CoV-2, which showed that the newly identified virus could become a circulatory killer of influenza.
However, based on the decline in the number of new cases, there are promising indicators in China, indicating that the current strategy is working.
In fact, one million cases were predicted with half a million deaths in Ebola.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been overcome.
It is also possible that like SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 also weakens the spread of the infected disease and eventually ceases to exist with humans like a low-risk virus.
The following form provides a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS (55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by coughing or sneezing and possibly by direct contact with the virus-borne substance.
The virus is also found in the pelvis, which creates a new possibility of transmission from the pelvis to the mouth.
A recent study on 138 cases found that 41 percent of the cases were likely due to non-communicable infections, 17 patients with any other disease, and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, people, especially health care providers, social workers, home workers, colleagues, and even those who are in contact with patients or infected should be very careful.
In order to reduce the risk of infection, the first tip of the defense is to wear a mask on the face; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (Series <0x23>1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected person from traveling through the air or sticking to objects' surfaces from where they can reach others.
However, only N95 (Serial <0x23>1860) masks can prevent small viral particles from breathing between 10 and 80 nm, with only 5% of viral particles entering completely, the SARS-CoV-2 size being the same as SARS-CoV, both of which are about 85 nm.
Even though five surgical masks are combined, this particle can penetrate them, so health care providers who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (Serial <0x23>1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear isolated gowns to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also affect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he had to wear an N95 mask; the virus probably entered with his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should wear a transparent cover or fountain on the face while working with patients.
It is highly advisable for the people of the affected or potentially affected areas to wash their hands more often than usual with sterile soap, try to quarantine themselves inside the house and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet from the patient is considered to be the appropriate distance.
These functions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus in the human world, it is the highest homogeneity of SARS-CoV, according to a report in January 2020, and should be the cause of a high alert for China based on a deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) director reassured citizens that the novel virus has less infectious and limited reproductive capacity than humans and that prevention and control of the disease is not a problem.
This message significantly calmed the public's alarm, especially when they were preparing for the Spring Festival, and wasted time controlling the disease at least on a scale in Wuhan.
In China, disease control agencies may have learned from this difficulty and brought significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must (1) be careful when making public announcements as each word is important to citizens and can alter their behavior and decisions; (2) to assess the effectiveness of the time-testing system of physicians or personnel rather than to examine the general information of the public and to respond to the general public; (3) to prevent possible epidemics, rather than to relieve the public.
The COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019 with the novel virus SARS-CoV-2.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and around 50 other countries globally.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of re-infection of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for keeping the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and more men than women, and its severity and mortality rates are higher in older people than in young people.
SARS mortality rates are higher than COVID-19 (41.44 compared to %10.91).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they do not have symptoms while SARS patients do so when they are seriously ill, making it more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have regular RNA negative for SARS-CoV-2.
In other words, the virus can be positive again in recovered patients.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of key issues remain to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs have been found, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Who was the first person to transmit the virus to humans?
Without knowing the answer to <0x23>1 and <0x23>2, we cannot effectively reduce the transfer process and it can spread again at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing show that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with this ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and how pathological changes occur?
Is the virus also linked to cells that show ACE2 in other organs?
Without the right answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic continue?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it end like SARS, or will it continue to happen from time to time?
This is important, but it may take some time to find the answers to the above and some other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
Animal sources of human coronavirus.
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations, including humans, have led to the mutual evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host organisms.
Before 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were known for mild disease such as common colds.
The severe respiratory distress system (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory system (MERS) used the coin to show how devastating and life-threatening the HCoV infection can be.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 once again highlighted the CoVs, and its rapid transmission and decline in pathogenesis compared to its sister SARS-CoV surprised us.
The HCoV infection is an infection transmitted from animals to humans and it serves to understand the animal source of HCoVs.
Most HCoVs originate from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known to host organisms in between reservoirs.
Identifying host animals that have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
Enquiring about the CoV-hosted organism in animals leads to significant awareness of pathogenesis CoV in humans.
In this review, we present a review on the knowledge about the seven HCoVs, in which we focus on the history of their discovery, as well as the source and mixed analogy of their animals.
Importantly, we compare and distinguish different HCoVs from the point of view of the evolution of different viruses and the restoration of their genes.
In this context, the current COVID-19 pandemic will be discussed.
In addition, the effects of virus prevention have been highlighted on the requirements for successful host animal changes and the severity of the disease.
The coronavirus (CoVs) belongs to the family of coronaviruses, including a group of malfunctions, positive senses, single-stranded RNA viruses.
Among the RNA viruses, these viruses using large genes such as 26 to 32 lbs were called "CoV" due to the appearance of a crown-like morphology from electron microscopy.
Structurally, CoVs have non-specific genes that participate in a similar organization.
Nearly two-thirds of the genomes contain two large open frames of reading (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polynomials of pp1a and pp1ab.
This polynomial further implements 16 non-structural enzymes, named nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORFs for structural semantics, including nodes (S), malfunctions (E), membranes (M), and new kilolograms (N).
A large number of assistive rhythms of specific sequences are also encoded through different cell CoVs.
Based on the difference in the lamination settings, the CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), with the beta-CoV generation mostly consisting of HCoVs, and more saliva (A,B,C and D).
Evidence from Filo Genetics showed that, most bats and mice are the source of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while Gamma-CoV and Delta-CoV are the largest reserves of birds.
For thousands of years, CoVs constantly passed through the barriers of different species and some of them emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Common symptoms such as HCoV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, making it more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary lesions in relatively and more patients to cause lower respiratory tract infections.
In the mid-1960s, the strain of HCoV-229E, B814, separated the nasal discharges from patients with mild cold.
Since then, more and more information has been collected through extensive studies conducted on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, before the spread of SARS, the concept was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs is usually harmless.
The SARS epidemic, which occurred in 2003, is the deadliest in current history, affecting more than 8,000 people with nearly 10% mortality.
Ten years later, the spread of respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Middle East resulted in a permanent outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula that spread to the whole world.
The 2019 Novel (2019-nCoV), later known as SARS-CoV-2, is the leading agent of the 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which took over 3,120 lives as of March 3, 2020, and affected more than 91,000 people.
The alarm is ringing and the world will have to prepare for the upcoming global pandemic SARS-CoV-2.
The sources of all seven HCoVs are animal bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Numerous lines of evidence support the evolution of all HCoVs from bats of origin, where viruses exhibit a well-adjusted and non-pathogenic but high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented countless medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
The origin of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, the power of the spread, and the mechanisms of the restriction of transmission to different species.
This may also help or guide in finding the hosts of SARS-CoV-2 reserves, middle- and raised animals with significant implications in preventing recurrence in the future.
In this review, we will present a review of the source animals, mixed analgesics, and pathogens of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common idea that the father-in-law viruses of HCoVs are usually non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir host animals and become pathogenic after they are transferred to their new host organism.
We also examine the evolution of HCoVs, which often leads to an increase in transmission with a decrease in the pathogen.
The results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have also been discussed.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
The strain of HCoV-229E was first isolated from the B814, before the substance released from the nose of patients with mild cold, different animals infected with various CoVs, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoVs by historical order will be informative and instructive.
In 1966, the HCoV-229E pressure was separated before the respiratory tract of patients suffering from upper respiratory tract infection, and later the WI-38 was adopted to increase the cell lines of the lungs.
10% to 20% of cases of HCoV-229E suffer from mild colds, including headaches, sneezing, restlessness and vomiting, and symptoms of throat inflammation with cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the culture of organs and then put into the serial pathway of the brain of small mice.
The medical characteristics of the HCoV-OC43 infection look similar to those with HCoV-229E, which are not markedly different from the pathogens of other respiratory tracts like influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were distributed globally, and they spread more in moderate climates during the winter.
In general, the growth time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by illness for about 2 weeks.
According to a voluntary study of humans, the HCoV-229E of healthy people produces a mild cold.
In patients with only a few immune systems, a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract appears.
SARS, also known as "a common pneumonia", was first well documented as a global epidemic caused by HCoVs in human history and is the SARS-CoV etiological agent, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in <0x58>injiang, China.
The SARS epidemic that spread across many countries and continents resulted in 8,096 cases with 774 deaths.
In addition to the rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, which has a growth period of 4 to 7 days and the 10th day of the disease is at the limit of viral load and it can increase about two secondary cases.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially have symptoms of muscle pain, colds, fever, nausea, and colds, followed by late-onset symptoms, coughing, and shortness of breath.
It is common for lymphocytic pancreas, SARS to have abnormal liver function and some elevated creatine kinase.
In patients with SARS, the spread of ulcers, the spread of epithelial cells, and the increase of macrophages are also observed.
Then about 20 to 30 percent of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, many organs, including the lower respiratory tract, liver and kidneys, can be affected, usually with cytokine strom, which can be fatal, especially in low-strength immune patients.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from the open lung biopsy of an index patient's relative, who had travelled from Zhongzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of research has been done on HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it is found in small children, elderly, and low-strength immune patients with respiratory disease.
In the disease caused by HCoV-BL63, inflammation of the nasal cavity, a sore eye, fever and veins are common.
Another independent study described the separation of the same virus from the nose sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed globally.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 in the general respiratory tract is about 4.7%, and its symptoms are severe in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with stop-loss cough, also known as cramps.
That same year, a 71-year-old Hong Kong man who was hospitalized due to pneumonia and inflammation of the kidneys was isolated from HCoV-HKU1.
With inflammation in the community-acquired pneumonia and nausea, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with severe asthma.
Similarly, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which has mild respiratory disease, were found worldwide.
These four community-acquired HCoVs are very well-adjusted to humans and are generally less likely to cause a change in the formation of highly pathogenic disease, although accidents have occurred due to unknown causes, such as the more severe subspecies of HCoV-NL63 in acute respiratory distress cases.
Usually, when they acquire the ability to move HCoVs and maintain themselves continuously within humans, they become low-intensity or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old Saudi patient suffering from severe pneumonia and kidney failure.
Where most of the confirmed cases from the laboratory are found in the Middle East, and sometimes in close contacts with secondary outbreaks, imported cases are found in European countries and Tunisia.
A secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases spread in South Korea in 2015.
The medical descriptions of MERS are similar to SARS, which has the characteristics of advanced severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, multiple patients with MERS have severe kidney failure, which is very unique from MERS in diseases caused by HCoVs.
More than 30 percent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases in the laboratory accounted for 34.4% of deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses found in humans.
Between mid-December 2019 and the end of 2019, a large number of pneumonia patients associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection from Hubei Province, Wuhan, China, were last detected.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the ongoing respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency and called it COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, of which 3.4% of those treated have died.
In particular, the death toll in these cases in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while out of that it is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also causes severe respiratory infections and is presented as fever, cough and sneezing.
In some patients, it has also been observed.
One of the most severe symptoms is pneumonia and it can increase the syndrome of acute respiratory distress.
Although 82% of high nucleosides are similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is a flag of different branches of the pathogenic tree.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 reported symptoms of non-symptomatic subjects infected, which can contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
There are many interesting similarities and differences in comparison and contrast with the other six HCoVs of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, HCoVs have a lot of similarities in the growth period and duration of the disease.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the other four (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, it has been commonly seen that during the infection of HCoVs obtained from the SARS-CoV-2 community, including with no specific, mild or no symptoms, the symptoms of their infection show.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as SARS-CoV infection, although this ratio is somewhat lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the community shows interesting features like HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the minimum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the community received from HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed that, like cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after entering humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also be found in waste samples.
Although at least in some circumstances that are yet to be explained in future studies, whether SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in oral waste transfer, like the case of SARS-CoV-2.
It will also be particularly interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2, like the HCoVs obtained from the community, will also appear seasonally.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 after entering humans, including transmission, pathogenicity, and sustainable spread, will have an impact on the final outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Well-adjusted in humans, the four HCoVs obtained from the community cause mild symptoms.
From the other point of view, it may also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both types can be immune to the global epidemic of ancient HCoVs.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who suffer from severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
In order to do this, HCoVs that collect the desired mutation will have to be replicated in humans to counteract the host organism's restriction to a considerable extent.
In this regard, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will last and the more people will be affected, the more likely that humans will fully adapt to it.
If it is taken well, then it will be difficult to prevent its transmission to humans through quarantine or other measures that control the infection.
For many years, four CoVs derived from the community have been circulating in the population, creating a common cold among immune-controlled individuals.
These viruses do not require animal stockings.
On the other hand, humans with highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well and their transmission in humans cannot be sustained.
They need to grow and thrive in their animal reserves, and possibly find an opportunity to spread to sensitive human targets through one or more medium and extended host organisms.
SARS-CoV-2 has features such as both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs derived from the community.
At least at this time, it has more ability to move like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if humans will fully adapt to it and it will circulate in humans without any reserve or intermediate host animal.
Before we talk about the origins of the HCoVs, it would be better to talk about the evolution, nature, reserves, middle and widening of the host animals of HCoVs, and their characteristics.
An animal, if it has a closely related interspecies association, acts as an evolutionary host organism of HCoVs, sharing a high degree of similarity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
Ethnic viruses are generally well-drained and non-pathogenic in this host organism.
Similarly, the host organism shelters HCoVs continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, host organisms are naturally infected and are natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is introduced to humans by the intermediate host organism at or before the introduction, it may not be better adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This medium host can act as the animal source of the human infection and then play the role of the host to greatly accelerate the human infection in humans.
If HCoVs do not maintain the transmission within the intermediate host organism, it will go in the closed path of infection.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host organism and even establish long-term nutrition.
In such a case, the middle host becomes the host of the living natural reservoir.
Epidemiological figures have revealed with disappointment that the SARS index cases have a history of contact with sports animals.
An investigation into the subsequent outbreaks found that animal traders had a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV lgG than the general population.
In the animal market, the first known virus, such as SARS-CoV, was identified in a recognising dog and pam swat cats.
It indirectly supports the fact that no SARS was reported after hitting all the seaweed cats in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masks from forests or farms were largely negative for SARS-CoV without the appearance in the live animal market, which suggests that mask palm swabs may only function as a medium-sized host organism but are not the natural stockpile of SARS-CoV.
In particular, since 80% of the different animals in the markets of Zhengzhou contain antibodies to SARS-CoV, many small mammals that breastfeed SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out of the possibility of working as an extended intermediate host organism.
All of these appear as closed path hosts of SARS.
The natural host of SARS-CoV has exposed closely related bat CoVs, called SARS-related rhinofoss bats CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), which is present in the Chinese horse venomous bat.
These bats are positive for the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other beta-CoVs share a 92-88% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the host animals of human pathogenesis.
Several SARS-like strains have also been identified from bats, namely, SL-CoVs, but none other than a designated WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin-changer enzyme 2 (ACE2) is called the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from a sample of bat's graces was demonstrated to be used as a receptor for bats, swabs and human ACE2's entrenchment cell.
Interestingly, Sira's recovery SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related SARS-CoV of bat race, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite the extremely similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the father-of-the-father virus of SARS-CoV directly and bats are not the host of the immediate reservoir of SARS-CoV.
The membrane of MERS-CoV of the same group was analyzed as beta CoV-HKU4 and beta CoV-HKU5, phlogenic analysis.
Bet CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV, use the same representative receptor, dipeptyl peptides 4 (DPP4) for virus entry.
Depending on the RNA of MERS identified from Europe and Africa, RNA polymerase sequences are genetically closer to counterparts in beta-tea-CoV.
So far, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closely related beta CoV-HKU25 share a similarity of only 87% nucleotide sequences.
Thus, bats may not be a host of immediate deposits of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East found that in a number of African countries, like the Middle East camels, there is a co-bent servo pozito for the specific inhibitory antibody of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from a koban camel's nose, and this further indicates that camels act as the real host of MERS-CoV.
It is worth mentioning that, experimentally infected camels with MERS-CoV had generally mild symptoms but large-scale virus flow observed.
In particular, the virus spreads from infected camels not only through the respiratory tract but also through the waste oral route, which is also the main route for the flow of the virus from bats.
However, questions remain as there is no date for several confirmed cases of MERS to be linked to camels before the onset of symptoms, including transmission from humans to humans or species of unknown animals, which shelter MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is a 96.2% nucleotide equivalent partner with the isolated CoV RaT13 bat from the rhinoplasty bat.
Like cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is great to assign the parent relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
I mean, the direct host of the beta SARS-CoV-2 can't be an animal unless the beta CoV is almost identical in the future.
Probably, the wholesale market of Hogan's seafood diet, which has many early cases associated with COVID-19, and which are possibly indicative of the transfer from animal to human, will be the host animals in the middle of the SARS-CoV-2, a species of wildlife that is sold and killed.
Several recent studies based on the meta-genetic sequence suggest that a group of endangered breastfeeding small organisms known as the pangolin (Manas javinica), may also be a refuge for the parent beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These nootropics share a similarity of 85-92 nucleotide typhoid sequences with SARS-CoV-2.
However, these nucleotide sequences are closely related to RaTG13 with approximately 90% identification at the level of nucleotides.
These files are membranes of a subspecies similar to SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the genetic tree, one of which shares 97.4 amino acids with continuous identification, as well as the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2.
RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, on the other hand, are more diverse, despite the high degree of range of genetics consistent with genetics.
Previous studies on the diseased pagolane were reported to have found viral material from samples of the lungs, which are similar to the corresponding SARS-CoV-2.
This study has adopted a variety of assembly methods and manual protections, which is about 86.3% of full-length viral genetics.
We cannot rule out the possibility that penguins are one of the host animals in the middle of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence of support for SARS-CoV-2 directly from the source of the pangolin due to the sedentary difference between beta-CoVs of SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also smaller than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The development of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, penguins and other mammals is yet to be established.
While, the best sequence similarities are found in the receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the best wide genetic sequence similarities.
It is highly speculated that, between SARS-CoV-2 and Pagolan SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective arbitrariness evolution.
In the third wild animal category, a response has been proposed in favour of a resurgence between the pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and RaTG13.
The spread of vesicle mass refractory between beta CoVs, exists as a motivating force in evolution.
A decision on the direct animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be made.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied to be an animal source.
Physiological evidence suggests that the original sources of both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be beta-CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a beta CoV in North America's Triangular Beta has shown a close relationship with the term ARCOV.2 (Eplachnage Reg Co.) with HCoV-NL63.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, was genetically related to another beta-CoV, Heposidrozo/Ghanadrum/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with camels also suspected of being its intermediate host.
For clarity, the current knowledge about the animal source of identified HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phyto-genetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrences of mixed analgesics transmission of HCoVs in history.
When domestic live-stock HCoV-OC43 crossed the species to infect humans around 1890, the global epidemic of respiratory infections was recorded.
The history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Beta alpha-CoVs have been found to have a close relationship with HCoV-229E.
There is an alpha CoV.
Several evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, in the shared environment, bats can interact with humans and not with alpacas.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpha CoVs are caused by respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, Alpaca alpha CoV was not found in pets.
Thus, this possibility cannot be ruled out that Alpacas acquires HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, humans are a direct source of pathogenic viruses, including the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Napa virus, and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bat alpha CoVs act as a gene pool of an HCoV-229E, alpha and camels can act as intermediate representatives, just like cases of MERS-CoV, which transmit the virus to humans.
MERS-CoV acts as the best example of a mixed analwa transmission from bats to humans from a koban camels and camels.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV in bats is known as its early identification and is also reinforced by subsequent results.
Obviously, bats provide a rich pool of virus type for the transmission and exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies.
Long life, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly, favorable conditions for bats to become an ideal 'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, for decades MERS-CoV has been introduced into a quandary camel.
It has been well adapted to camels that have directly changed from the host organism to the stable and natural reservoir host organism.
MERS-CoV maintains very mild disease and relatively low rate variation in these animals.
Sometimes transmission in its humans is an accident, and humans are the closed path hosts of MERS-CoV because they cannot maintain its transmission.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the role of penguins, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolins are highly pathogenic in beta-CoVs pangolins.
They may be the closed path hosts for SARS-CoV-2 B-to-CoV, similar to the cytokines in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies may include or rule out a number of possibilities for a mixed analogy of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, bats can be the source of SARS-CoV-2, a host of almost similar viruses like SARS-CoV-2.
Humans share an environmental niche with bats through carcinogens or coal mining.
Second, penguins can be one of the faster intermediate host organisms, with the SARS-CoV-2-related virus newly introduced.
Humans get close to the virus through hunting and eating.
It is possible that a number of breastfeeding animals, including domestic animals, are suffering from SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody is guaranteed in domestic and wild animal surveys.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2's reoccurrence and adaptation can occur in the third species in contact with both bats and penguins.
The search for animal sources of SARS-CoV-2 is still underway.
In addition to the variety of host animals, CoVs are important in facilitating three major factors by the viral in crossing several types of barriers.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in the transcription of RNA.
Compared with the second single-stranded RNA viruses, the rate of change of CoVs can be considered "high" from "moderate" while the average replacement rate of each year on each site 2, depending on the phase of adaptation of the novel host organism CoV, is 10-4 as an alternative.
CoVs contain prophylaxis reading external bonnets, whose deletion results in a better variable, attention-seeking, even inaccessibility.
Interestingly, the new nucleotide analog remdesivir is known to suppress the copy of CoVs through the inhibition of this external bonankles and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Remdesivir is a highly intelligent agent tested as a contraindication to SARS-CoV-2 in medical practice.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is one million times higher than that of its host animals.
In addition, often when CoVs can't adapt well to the host organism, it has a higher rate of variation.
Compare the highest mutation rate of SARS-CoV, so apparently the rate of mutation in the well-adjusted SARS-CoV-2 in humans is low.
Probably, it has already been adapted to another host organism close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, which is well-adjusted in a cobalt camel, is applied.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the increased genetics make the vaccine and antivirals effective immediately against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the genes present in the CoVs show the use of additional adaptations in genetic modification for large RNA mutations and reversal synthesis, thus increasing the probability of the mutual evolution of mixed anaemia, which is beneficial for the appearance of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by a number of unique reading frames and lemming functions toward the 3' end of the genome.
Third, through the unique mechanism of "copy selection" often switch to CoV randomly RNA templates.
During the transcription of CoV RNA, in the host organism acting as a mixture, there is a frequent change in the cord.
To produce new CoVs, there may be a full length of highly homologous and a recombination of subgenerative RNAs.
Evidence of the natural combination of phylogenetics has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Communicating with the host organism of the virus in relation to transmission
In addition to the three factors of the above-mentioned viral, viral interaction with the host organism receiver is an important factor in the effective and mixed anaphase transfer.
With this, SARS-CoV's retractable structure is taken as a common example, which had evidence of positive selection during the mixed-alcohol transition.
In addition to the comparative analysis of the isolation of SARS-CoVs from humans and Sioux, SARS-CoVs in various host organisms, in particular with the variation of S-Lymia's receptor binding domain, is the concept of rapid collapsing.
In general, the receptor binding domain in the s of CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is strongly selected through the host organism's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain on the S1 piece is the 318th to 510th amino acid, binding to human ACE2 as well as its correspondents for viral entry.
SARS-CoV receptor binding domains are able to identify ACE2 receptors for various animals, including bats, cerebellums, rats, and ricoin dogs, that allow for a mix of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues in the receptor binding domain were found to be different in the isolated viral of humans and the cerebellum, 4 of them in the form of receptor binding to interact with the receptor of ACE2.
The receptor binding domain of SEAT SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations, which can enhance the interaction of nucleic acids with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acids may prove to be the main substitution for viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy, that SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV shares the same cell receptor.
The difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S-Lymia indicates that the human ACE2 may change its essential binding to S-Lahmia.
Of course, a study of a barbaric electromagnetic microscope is pointing to this association between human ACE 2 and SARS-CoV's S lymph nodes being between -10 to -20 times higher.
It will also be interesting to determine if any other sub-receptor will be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2 but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetlated acids for HCoV-OC43.
They can assess the successful adaptation of these CoVs after a mixed analwa transmission from their host animal to humans.
In addition to cell receptors, HCoVs are monitored for the result of mixed anaemia transmission, depending on another host organism and through binding factors.
The spread of these host hummingbirds between humans and HCoVs, such as bats, a whale camel and mice, can hinder the transmission of mixed larvae.
HCoVs have a successful mixed analgesic transfer to the angry host organism's dependency factors and disruptive host organism's binding factors.
In this regard, the molecular identification and characteristics of this important part of the interaction with the host organism of the virus remain to be determined.
Depending on the host organism and the neutral wide genetic testing of the binding factors for SARS-CoV-2 may be beneficial by the use of the latest technology of CRISPR.
Nol HCoVs Ejection: Return to zero ground
The diversity of beta CoVs provides enough opportunities for the release of novel HCoVs.
In this regard, beta CoVs act as a gene pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic mutations also increase the development of HCoVs and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of the novel lemming gene, the ability to quickly change the phenotype of the viral.
In the presence of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is considered important in human adaptation, as were separating the beta viruses related to SARS-CoV, but found different encodes of ORF8 enzymes.
The strains, which were isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, have been identified to eliminate 29 nucleotides of SARS-CoV.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and this is a adaptive variation that promotes the transfer of host organisms.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible reoccurrence with a series of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where RNA polymerases depending on RNA were identified in large number of recyclable structures.
The locations of the respirator were identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has also been observed that the MERS-CoV epidemic, which took place in a quandary camel in Saudi Arabia, has experienced resurgence of events between different cells.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recurrence sequences have also been observed in other CoVs, in which HCoVs reproduce with their non-organic genes with other animal CoVs.
It should also be warned that artificial selection may contribute to unannounced changes in viral genetics, possibly avoiding selective pressures, such as the host organism's immune system, resulting from the virus' survival.
An example of its effects is the loss of the entire length of ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, causing the removal of two nucleotides.
Although the presence of ORF4 in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E can be observed, alpha-alpha-CoV shows the inclusion of a single new nucleotides, resulting in a frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the selected pressure in their reservoir host organisms.
When bats are infected with CoVs, a symptom or mild symptom is detected, indicating a correlation between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats have good compatibility with anatomically and physically with CoVs.
For example, defects in inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce dynamic pathology through CoVs.
In addition, bats suppress natural killer cell activity due to low levels of expression of receptor NKG2/CD94 of natural killer cell receptors and large histocompatibility complexes class I.
Furthermore, the high metabolites of bats actively reactivate the high levels of oxygen type (ROS) by suppressing the copying of both CoVs, and by affecting the proofreading through the extra bonnets to create the highly pathogenic virus strains, when a new host organism is introduced, to provide the desired pressure, to produce the highly pathogenic virus strains.
More pathogenic CoV strains can be produced through retinopathy, which can increase the properties of novel leukemias or leukemias for the adaptation of the host organism.
So, it's not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their reservoir host organisms such as bats and camels.
They reproduce strongly without the immune response of the powerful host organism.
In this, the secrets of why unmarked disease healers are shown and what causes severe cases in human infections are hidden.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivity of the immune response and cytokine strom in which the lungs are damaged by a stronger immune response, more intensely.
On the other hand, in an unmarked disease carrier, the immune response has been de-capitated by a copy of CoV.
The same strategy of non-infecting the immune response to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 has a beneficial effect.
The reaction of interferon in bats in particular is particularly powerful.
Therefore, the organization of type I interferon should benefit in the early stages of infection of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
In addition, the inflammation of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
For this reason, NLRP3 inflammation prevention in the treatment of COVID-19 may be beneficial to do with MCC950.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea emerging through SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While a bat has been found to share a 95% new nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, there is a beta-CoV that is sharing a nucleotide similarity of 96% with SARS-CoV-2.
While swabs and other animals in the market have been found to shelter viruses such as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs have been found to be surprisingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, meaning that penguins are acting as one of the intermediate host organisms, or that penguins can contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2 through genetic fragments.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has been deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, CoVs have come back to light.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has changed our view of animal origin and animal reserves of HCoVs in human transmission.
Widespread evidence suggests that the source of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is bat, and it has been transmitted to humans through a medium host organism.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by the interaction between humans and sputum in the markets, the SARS epidemic can be effectively eliminated by closing the meat markets and killing the sputum.
For this reason, in the wake of the discovery of a number of salivas of the closely associated pangolin beta-CoVs from SARS-CoV-2, the pangolin should be removed from meat markets to prevent transmission from animals.
However, in future investigations, it remains to be explained when and where SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through penguins and other mammals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in a quandary camel for a long time.
For locals, these camels serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather and wool, as well as an important source of transport.
They are widely found in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, just like what was done in China's markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS.
In order to prevent the recent spread of MERS, along with other measures to control infection, a sensible approach should be adopted to develop an effective vaccine against MERS for camels.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, they can cause the emergence of new genetic variants.
The species and species of animals in the forest are circulating CoVs.
In particular, bat CoVs with capacity in animals are very diverse.
As a result of the emissions of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in the future, there are many opportunities for the animal CoVs to develop and regenerate.
Wild animals should abandon the food culture in some places in China to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 trials, a better preparation and response plan should be in place.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reserves until they have a chance to grow.
Although bats have many characteristics that cause the spread of viruses, chances of contact with human bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are educated.
For a better understanding of CoV and its natural hosts, continuous monitoring of breastfeeding animals is essential, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of the disease from animals to humans and its future spread.
As a result, by staying away from the environment of the natural reservoirs of the virus of human-to-human transmission from animals to humans, the viral of diseases transmitted from animals to humans can be more effectively prevented.
Several pieces of the puzzle of being the source animal of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First of all, if an ethnic virus of bat SARS-CoV-2 transmits to the pangolin, it will be interesting to see if bats and penguins can share the same environmental power under what conditions.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third breastfeeding animal acts as a real middle representative, it must explain how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats, and penguins.
Finally, because many other breastfeeding animals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, so their monitoring and experiments for infection should be conducted both.
If bats, penguins, or any other breastfeeding animals are, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 and its parent viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural representatives.
The ongoing investigation in this field will explain the development journey of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to renew the diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "verified case" of COVID-19.
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid advisory guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, this guide provides our experience and is a good reference to fighting the global pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, it is increasing gradually based on the results of ongoing research in our awareness and knowledge and the experience of medical practice; therefore, evaluation and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our directives, which have been issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, saying that the latest diagnostic standards of "suspect case" and "verified case" are provided in accordance with the final guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (the seventh version).
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread, now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been named severe respiratory distress coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
In order to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advisory guideline and it has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has gained a lot of attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, based on the results of ongoing research in our awareness and knowledge, and the experience of medical practice, it is gradually increasing; therefore, evaluation and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued a guideline for diagnosis and treatment for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), its total of seven issues from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, with some fundamental changes being made in its context.
Now our guide has received a comment from Zhao et al., who has suggested easy scoring based on his medical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline, and it is a valuable reference to this global pandemic around the world.
We thank him for his excellent work and thank him for it.
However, their work also needs to be updated in line with the latest COVID-19 (constant trial version) and the latest assessment and treatment guidelines of recent studies.
According to the seventh issue (3 March 2020), a comprehensive analysis is required by combining any one feature of the history of the epidemic with two items of medical compensation to confirm the suspected case, or by combining three items of medical prescription without a clear date of the epidemic:
History of the pandemic: (1) the history of travel or residence in the Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where there have been cases of COVID-19 confirmed in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) the history of contact with the infected cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with the positive cases of the previous day); (3) the history of contact with the patient in the Wuhan city and surrounding area.
Medical conditions: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with hypothetical characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) the number of white blood cells in the early onset stage shows the normal, decreasing, or low lympho-site count.
Diagnosis of suspected cases with either one of the following items in the pathogen or serological evidence should be: (1) to be positive of the real-time PCR test of the anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific stage of SARS-CoV-2; (2) the sequence of the entire viral genetics showing the high-density of known novel coronaviruses; (3) in the serological test.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid was included in the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) numbers in respiratory tract or blood samples.
The detection of pathogens in blood samples was included in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); and the serological evidence was included in the seventh issue.
Research-based revision work is underway to find more nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis in confirmed quality, as well as to take respiratory tracts, including blood samples that increase the availability of different samples, and help bring positive results of specific antibodies.
In addition, there are many other evidences that remind us of caution from patients with traditional symbolic and without symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zoe et al. should be updated, as they have classified the individual as "low risk" without medical symptoms.
The score system also needs to be confirmed in more medical practice and studies.
As a result, we expect more direct evidence to come and demand readers to give their feedback.
To diagnose "suspicious cases" and "verified cases," we advise them to trace and comply with the latest guidelines in their home countries.
Our team works on a timely basis to offer help.
Five new deaths have been reported in Bangladesh due to COVID-19, the highest daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) said the number of confirmed cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Meredith Sabrina Flora said four men were among the dead.
According to Dr. Mir Jadi, two cases were over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
One of the dead was Jalal Saif-ur-Rehman, the director of the Bengali anti-corruption scandal, who was taken care of at Kuwait's maternity hospital, a hospital official said.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh Road Transport and Bridge Minister Abid al-Qadar said public transport would be closed for a long time from this coming week under the initial plan.
Initially, the closure of public transport began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essentials -- medical supplies, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh on March 8 were recorded in two people who had returned from Italy and one of them was in the wife.
By 19 March, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections globally.
On Thursday, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated that the total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections globally exceeded one million.
About 52,000 deaths are related to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and the first death related to the coronavirus in Zambia.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed it was one of the few countries that has so far been free from coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases, at 10 a.m. Central Europe time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 24,000 coronavirus cases were recorded, linked to 5,900 deaths.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 1,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus as of Wednesday.
Around the world, countries have announced strict measures to stop the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor, Sergey Sobyanin, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments would continue until April 30 without working for the Russians.
Portugal's parliament voted in favor of a 15-day extension in a national emergency; the vote was 215 votes in favour, 10 revocables, and one vote against it.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew for a full day in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina: before that, the curfew was effective from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand will impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor, Mike DeWine, announced that the state has extended the order to stay at home until May 1.
In Australia, the number of toilet paper in stores has been reduced to one in every transaction.
On Sundays and Saturdays, Australian store chains Walworth and Quills reduced the restrictions on the purchase of toilet tissue paper in all stores at battered nationally to two and one pack on each transaction.
ALDI also introduced the range of a pack, on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on checkouts, and chainfaceback pages.
Buyers were reported to have stored it in case of people's need for self-isolation due to fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworth also restricted the purchase of toilet tissue paper for home delivery to one pack on each order.
These changes were followed by a four-pack ban on each transaction that was previously introduced by Willworth and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Quills, in a media release on March 8, reported that with a ban of four packs in one place, "many stores are still selling within an hour of delivery," and the demand was "unprecedented", while ALDI said on a Facebook post on Tuesday, calling it "unprecedented."
According to Woolworth's spokesman, last week's sales were "a huge increase."
Costa Rica's store in Canberra also restricted last week's allowed number to two packs.
In order to reduce the shortfall, Coils ordered larger packets from supply providers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworth ordered additional storage, while ADLI stored for special initial availability on the planned day.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said that retailers try to increase the stockpile, but the ban on the timing of the delivery truck by the local council has made it difficult.
In addition to the increased production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand and do something special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after a stock discount, some stores could not run specific Wednesdays.
Dr Gary Martimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said in a report from News.com.au that stores fill up storage every night.
He said that toilet tissue paper is a big thing, which stores a small amount of it, and, when sold, leaves the wide space of the shelf empty, causing a feeling of severe shortness.
Russell Zimmerman said in ABC News, "Quells and Woolworth review [that] if there are a lot of things on the shelf, if products like toilets and sanitizers can go [purchase] and if they are in quantity, you may reduce panic."
The tissue paper maker of a crepe-recycled toilet said last Wednesday that they would be without storage.
According to a report by News.com.au, Camberley Clark, who makes the tissues of the clarinet toilet, and Solaris who make the sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
According to Domain.com, some property sellers in Melbourne offer a free toilet tissue paper to the first bidder at the auction, when buyers had time due to the long weekend of Labor Day.
In the Thursday issue of NT News, hidden in the daily Darwin, eight-page insulators were added, meaning they were cut and used as toilet tissue paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, the stores were actually reluctant to impose the restrictions, which they said had no plans to introduce a ban on their purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that the demand for other products, including masks, sanitary items, dry items, hand-washing and flour, is also high.
Similarly, on Sunday evening, outside Australia, the purchase of the British supermarket was observed to be limited to a pack of two to 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the ongoing spread of COVID-19 — the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — a global epidemic.
Although the term "pandemic" refers to the rapid spread of a disease, not to how dangerous certain cases are, the World Health Organization stressed the need for action by governments."
All countries can also change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people in response.
We are very concerned about both the dimensions of the disease due to its magnitude and severity limit and the alarming extent of action against it.
Dr Tom Friedan, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, said the pandemic was "unprecedented."
"In addition to influenza, no other respiratory virus has been detected in such a sequence from the start to the global spread," he said in his observations published in CNN in February.
Gabriels said, "We have never seen a global pandemic that's linked to the coronavirus."
He continued, "We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
In January, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic a public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said of the outbreak, "This is important, that it is moving towards further destruction."
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, the number of COVID-19 patients in the world stood at 126,000, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
The current global pandemic of 2019-20 coronavirus is a variant of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, on December 30, 2019, and international concern was declared as a public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and was identified as a global epidemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 patients were reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally it starts at 13.04 in Algeria and rises to 0.08 in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Complications may include symptoms of pneumonia and severe difficulty in breathing.
The duration from the appearance of the disease to the onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be in the range of two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Early treatment is symptomatic and supportive treatment - recommended to take precautions, soak up your mouth when you're sick, stay away from other people, and monitor and quarantine for those who suspect they're infected.
Authorities around the world have advocated travel restrictions, quarantine, curfews, workplace hazard control, and the closure of facilities.
The pandemic has caused disruptions in many global social events, including religious, political and cultural events, and a massive shortage of goods due to the purchase of goods in the wake of the pandemic.
Schools and universities in 193 countries were either closed at the national level or at the local level, affecting about 99.4% of the world's population.
Misunderstandings about the virus spread online and there have been instances of discrimination and discrimination against Chinese people, people of Eastern and Southeast Asia color and race, and those where cases of the virus have increased.
Due to low emissions and the closure of large industries, there has been a decrease in air density and carbon emissions.
Health officials in Wuhan, China, reported a collection of unknown pneumonia cases on December 31, 2019, and began an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these cases were related to the Hunan Seafood Hole Sale Market, which is why the virus is believed to be a species of animal diseases.
The virus from which the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that was closely related to bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV.
Two-thirds of the early incidents reported in December 2019 were related to markets.
On 13 March 2020, the South China Morning Post recommended in an unconfirmed report that the incident of a 55-year-old man in Hobi province on 17 November 2019 may be the first - the World Health Organization reported on 26 February 2020 that although cases in China are declining, due to a sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases reported from China has increased for the first time.
It can also reduce the number of cases, especially in people with common symptoms of the disease.
On February 26, 19-year-olds and younger adults reported relatively low incidences, accounting for 2.4% of the global incidence, with UK chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance measuring that 60% of the UK population would be affected by cataracts before becoming an effective crowd.
According to official protocols, the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 has been confirmed to be positive.
As of March 23, no country had tested 3% of its population, and the official policy of many countries was that only people with mild symptoms should not be tested, as was done in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 revealed that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 patients could not be identified and that it was the source of infection in 79% of unregistered patients.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of confirmed cases in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of basic re-production for COVID-19 are (R0) 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Many people with COVID-19 have recovered.
For those who do not, the duration from the appearance of the symptoms of the disease to death is 6 to 41 days, the most common of which is 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
As of February 5, nearly 80% of China's deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of people with pre-existing diseases, including heart disease and the official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic, usually due to the deaths they have tested positive, according to official protocols.
The exact number of deaths from COVID-19 may be several more than that, as those deaths do not include people who die without a test - such as at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic was higher than the official death toll from COVID-19 at <0x58>4-5.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that "we know that [the number of confirmed deaths] has been reported low," the statement confirms reports of fewer deaths in the United States.
The first death outside of mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, out of central China, more than a dozen deaths have occurred in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and regions reported deaths from each continent, except for the Pacific South. Several joint measures are used to determine deaths.
These numbers vary depending on region and time, and are affected by testing, quality of treatment systems, treatment options, time after the initial outbreak of the epidemic, and characteristics of the population such as age, sex and overall health.
Based on data from John Hopkins University, the proportion of global deaths and incidents as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies depending on the region.
The proportion of cases and deaths in China from the onset of disease symptoms (1-10 January 2020 for individuals) has dropped from 17.3% to 0.7% for individuals (from the onset of disease until 1 February 2020) - the other measures include the mortality rate (CFR) that shows the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease, and the percentage of deaths from infection (FFR).
These numbers are not for a specific period of time and range from infection to the final solution of the case to a particular population.
Several experts have tried to count this number for a particular population.
Based on evidence from Oxford University, the Center for Medicine has estimated that the mortality rate from infection in this global epidemic is between 0.1% and 0.39% overall.
The upper limit of this estimate is consistent with a statistical study analyzing the results of the first different tests of COVID-19 conducted in Germany, and the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization says the pandemic can be controlled.
The rise and final duration of this pandemic are different and uncertain depending on the location.
"If not checked, multiple outbreaks usually spread like surface-to-surface and then start coming down when the disease doesn't get any more hosts," said Mackenzie Bowie of Penn State University.
But it is absolutely impossible, when it will happen, to make a reasonable plan at the moment."
Zong Nanshan, the Chinese government's top medical adviser, stressed that "it could end by June" if all countries are encouraged to follow his advice on measures to prevent the spread of the global health virus.
On March 17, Charsky told Adam of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine that SARS-CoV-2 "will likely continue to orbit for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, distance from one another and other measures would be needed "until a vaccine becomes available (probably 18 months or more)".
"I don't think it's likely that this coronavirus — will be completely eradicated — because it's easily transmissible," said William Shefner of Vanderbilt University, "and it will "change into a seasonal disease, and come back every year."
The death of the return will depend on the extent of the reduction of the afghan crowd and its transformation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively inconclusive and the infected people can be without symptoms.
Two common symptoms include fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Low common symptoms include severe coughing, bloating (bloating), sneezing, shortness of breath, joint pain, sore throat, chills, colds, coughs, coughs, coughs, coughs, blood incandescent fever, and severe respiratory distress.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States includes a list of emergency symptoms: respiratory distress, frequent chest pain or pressure, sudden aches, aches and pains, and a sudden awakening of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention.
Some of these infected people can be without symptoms, they can be treated as confirmed patients with test results without medical symptoms, so researchers have recommended that people who have contact with confirmed patients should be closely monitored and tested to stay away from infections.
Without symptoms, the proportion of diseases in China is measured from a few numbers to 44 percent.
The period of incubation (between the time of infection and the onset of symptoms) typically lasts from one to 14 days; it usually lasts five days. For example, the end of the sense of smell in people with COVID-19<0x2B> was initially reduced to 30%, which later went down to 15%.
The extent of the disease is still being investigated.
It is believed that the disease initially spreads due to close relationships and is caused by the octets that are born when speaking or in the vaginal, kink, or speaking; where the distance in close contact is 1 or 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that a drop can range from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some people have suggested that the virus may also spread from the ovaries that remain in the air for a longer period of time, which can also cause respiratory droplets during exhalation, including during conversations, although the virus is not usually in the air.
These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of nearby people, or possibly enter the lungs while breathing.
Some medical procedures, such as intravenous ducts and artificially inhaling mouth-to-mouth breathing (CPR) can take out respiratory tracts and thus it can spread in the air.
It can also be transmitted when an infected surface is visible and then after that it has its eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns that it can also be spread by face, the risk is considered to be very low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the body's excreted substance, which is very contagious for three days before the onset of symptoms, although its spread is possible before symptoms and in the final stage of the disease.
Since a test can be positive for people up to three days before the onset of symptoms, it is believed that the transmission of the disease is possible before the appearance of effective symptoms.
Only a few confirmed cases have been reported from the laboratory where there are no pre-existing symptoms of the disease, but in some countries, the transmission of symptoms has been revealed without an investigation into links.
Europe's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease can spread, one person can usually infect two to three people - the virus can survive for hours to hours at different levels.
In particular, on plast (polie propylene) and 304 stainless steel, the virus was found to be recognizable for three days, up to a day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this period varies in humidity and temperature, and the COVID-19 test has been positive in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, but British authorities recommend taking it after contact with animals, such as when contacting other surfaces that are affected by the virus.
Severe respiratory symptoms coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that has previously been isolated from three people who have been diagnosed with pneumonia in the city of Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related natural coronavirus - outside the human body, the virus can be eliminated from the domestic soap, which lowers its protective shell.
It is believed to be caused by animal diseases.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is inherently related to the family of beta-coronavirus (nobbi) originating from two strains of bats in the feral lineage.
On the overall genome level, it is 96% similar to the other bat coronavirus specimen (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that only one amino acid is found in parts of the genome chain in humans and penguins.
In comparison to the full genome to date, it has been found that 92% of the genetic material is often combined in the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is enough to prove that the middle hosts of the pangolin virus.
Temporary diagnosis of infection from the virus can be based on the symptoms of the disease, although confirmation from infected fluids or ICT<0x58> is ultimately done through reverse transcription polymers chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan found that CT is less specific but significantly more sensitive than PCR, although its characteristic features are dominated by the practice of other pneumonia and diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for screens or as a first-degree test to diagnose COVID-19.
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription polymers chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is performed on the respiratory tract or blood sample.
Results are usually available from a few hours to a few days.
Usually, this test is done through anaphylaxis, although it can be used in the throat as well - many laboratories and companies are also equipped with insulation testing, which detects the antibody.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been proven to be quite accurate enough to be approved for mass use.
In the U.S., a serological test has been developed for emergency use only in accredited laboratories.
Characteristics of these people's radiographs and reflections on computed tomography (CT), which have symptoms of the disease, include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opioids and excessive flow of absenteeism.
The Italian Radiology Society is creating an international online database of photographic results of certified events.
Due to overlapping from other infections such as the adenovirus, the identification of COVID-19 imaging without PCR validation is limited.
A major study in China compared chest CT results with a PCR, which showed that although the imaging for the infection is less characteristic, it is faster and more sensitive, with the suggestion that it should be considered as a screening device in the epidemiological areas.
Built-in artificial intelligence-based built-in neural networks to detect both the virus's axiomatic properties, via radiography and CT.
The prevention strategies for the transmission of the disease include maintaining overall personal hygiene, wiping the hands, wiping the eyes, nose or mouth, and coughing and sneezing in the tissue, and rinsing the tissue directly into the garbage bin.
People who are already infected are advised to wear a face mask in public places.
Steps to prevent transmission of the disease are also recommended - many countries have restricted travel or refrained from non-essential travel to other countries or to areas that are affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading into the community in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the society and people in some communities do not know how and where it has been affected - health care professionals, who are concerned about the disease, are advised to take more preventive measures to prevent contact and eye protection.
For this purpose, privacy concerns about the use of space palace data by governments through mobile phones have been surfacing, Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limiting such surveillance.
As of April 7, 2020, various mobile apps have implemented it or advised for voluntary use, more than a dozen groups are working on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to get the venue from another mobile.
The user then receives a message if he or she has been close to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. misunderstandings are circulating regarding the prevention of infection; for example, putting water in the nose and making noise with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many agencies are working on the preparation of one.
It is recommended to use hand sanitizer to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC often advises people to wash their hands with soap for 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are obviously dry; before eating; and when a nose is cleaned, take a mouthful, take a mouthful, or chin.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap when its protective valve is removed.
The CDC recommends the use of a more alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume, when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces should also be cleaned in a number of ways (stainless steel levels should be maintained for one minute in front of an bacterium), including 62-71 ethanol, 50%-100 esophagus, 0.1 sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 to 7.5 ions.
Other methods, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrooxydronic gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if any suspected or certified COVID cases appear at a location, such as office or nursery, all areas, such as office, toilet, shared space, common electrical equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control, ATM machines, which are used by sick people, be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth with a sore throat or tissue while coughing and sneezing and discarding such tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be affected, because wearing masks limits both the size and distance of the person's ejected droplets, when he or she talks, he takes the chink and coughs.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, an expert on the virus at the University of Leeds, " wearing a mask may make people less likely to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if they are to be used without proper hygiene."
The World Health Organization recommends wearing masks for healthy people only if their health is at serious risk, as they are treating people with COVID-19, even though they recognize that wearing masks prevents people from covering their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing a non-native face mask made of cloth - China has specifically suggested that healthy people in public use defunct medical masks, especially when they are more likely to go up to 1 metre (3 feet) or less.
Hong Kong recommends using public transport sources or wearing a surgical mask while staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to wear face masks at home and give them a daily dose.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from wearing masks or going out in public without touching their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear face masks when they go to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ruled that everyone should wear a mask when entering the shops.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks when entering the country.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks daily since mid-March, also needs to wear masks in buses running between rail cars and cities from April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to wear a face mask while going out of the house, while at home it is recommended to prepare masks for those who do not have the capacity to buy masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves disease control actions aimed at reducing the spread of infection by limiting close contact between individuals.
These methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods while staying at home, avoiding going to the gym, avoiding receiving compliments, and physically avoiding each other.
Many governments are implementing or advising social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The crowd, recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations, was quickly reduced from 250 people (where there is no known case of map COVID-19) to 50 people, which was later reduced to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and people who are suffering from chronic or chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and other underlying conditions, such as the term "intimidating the public health system" to the extent that the underlying health conditions, such as exposure to the disease, and the underlying causes of the disease, have been addressed by the CDC.
From the term social distancing, people began to feel that they should be completely isolated from the world, instead of encouraging them to interact with other people in alternative ways.
They also recommend that they only have sexual intercourse with those who live with them who do not have any symptoms of the virus or the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are suspected to be infected.
The health authorities have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation and many governments have made it mandatory or recommended that the entire population living in an affected area go into self-quarantine.
The strictest of self-imposed quarantines have been issued to those who are in serious danger.
People who have had contact with a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where there is widespread disruption have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last possible disclosure.
Strategies for controlling an epidemic include prevention, control, or stress and mitigation.
The containment strategy is developed in the early stages of the pandemic and aims to identify and isolate the affected people, introduce other infection control measures, and vaccinate them to prevent the disease from spreading to other populations.
When it is not possible to prevent further spread of the disease, efforts are made to reduce its spread: measures are taken to reduce its spread and reduce its impact on the health system and society.
Steps to prevent and reduce effects should be taken at the same time.
To curb the pandemic, more stringent measures need to be taken to reduce the spread of the pandemic from 1 to less than the basic spread of the pandemic. Part of the management of infectious diseases is to try to reduce the epidemic's peak, which is called shattering the epidemic's spread.
It reduces anxiety for health services, which are getting overwhelmed, and provides more time for vaccine preparation and treatment to be discovered.
Non-violent measures that can regulate the spread of the epidemic include preventive measures, such as hygiene, wearing of face masks, and self-quarantine; social measures such as quarantine and quarantine, to prevent physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of mass gatherings; to involve the community to encourage people to take such measures.
Other countries have taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has extensively screened and quarantined locally and issued warnings on the movement of the victims.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those affected who quarantined themselves and imposed fines on those who did not.
The similarities between the UK and the United States show that mitigation (depleting the spread of the virus but not ending) and stress (growth of the pandemic) are major challenges.
Over-reduction policies can reduce health demand by up to 2/3 and mortality by half, but this could result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and the health system being overrun.
Pressure can be prioritized as a transition, but it should continue as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or as long as a vaccine is available, if it is first) otherwise it quickly returns to health when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention, social and economic costs to suppress the pandemic.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including experiments on existing drugs.
The use of anti-cold drugs, drinking excess water, and relaxing helps to eliminate the symptoms of the disease.
Depending on the severity of the disease, it may be necessary to apply oxygen, get a vaccine in the veins and take help in breathing.
The use of steroids can further aggravate the results.
Many compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also said that "some traditional and homeostasis" can ease the spread of SARS-CoV-19 disease.
The increase in the capacity and adaptation of health care professionals to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a key measure to respond to the pandemic.
The ECDC and the World Health Organization's Regional European Union Office have issued guidelines for resource change at various stages for hospitals and primary health centres, including focusing on laboratory services on the ability to test COVID-19, responding to optional behavioural responses, isolation and isolation of COVID-19 positive patients and intensive care through personnel training.
There are many theories as to where the first event (i.e. the lower patient) began.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hobi began to gradually increase.
Most of these cases are traced back to the Hunan Seaside Market, where living animals are sold, and there is a theory that the virus comes from this type of animal; in other words, the virus is a species of animal disease.
On December 30, a group of doctors from the central Wuhan hospital warned their colleagues about "coronaviruses like SARS".
Among them, Authu doctors, including Lee Wenlag, were warned by the police on spreading fake news and another one, Ai Fan, was reprimanded by his superiors for spreading the rumours.
Later, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public news release on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
By early January, Wuhan's health authorities had been briefed on enough cases of undiagnosed pneumonia to order an investigation, with the number of cases doubling every seven and a half days in the early stages of the outbreak.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, in which the main role was played by arrivals for China's New Year as Wuhan was the main transportation source and rail interchange.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.

On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus, several U.S. stock indexes, including the Nasdaq-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, saw the sharpest decline since 2008, where Dow, with a drop of 1,191 points, has fallen one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indexes fell more than 10 per cent over the weekend.
On February 28, the Scope Retailing GMBH confirmed China's own authorized credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Stock markets rebounded due to fear of the coronavirus, the biggest fall on March 16.
Many people think that there is a market opportunity.
Economist Muhammad L. Erin appreciated the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
The central bank is reacting more quickly than the 2008 financial crash.
Tourism is one of the most affected destinations due to travel restrictions, closure of public places, including tourist centers, and travel restrictions by governments globally.
As a result, a number of airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Cantas, cancelled flights due to low demand, while British airline Flybi also fell off the runway.
The maritime tourism industry has never been seen before.
Several railway stations and boat ports have also been closed.
The pandemic came at a time when China is a big travel season associated with New Year's Eve in China.
A number of events, which were attended by the overwhelming majority, were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year celebration, in which private companies closed their shops and tourist centers, as well as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several Lunar Year celebrations and tourist centers, including Forbidden City and traditional dome fairs, were closed in Beijing to avoid crowds.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipal and regional officials have directed New Year's Eve kites to be extended to February 10, and most workplaces will not reopen until this date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of response to the infectious disease to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, including closing schools until March and canceling New Year's celebrations, affecting the global retail sector, reducing or temporarily shutting down shop hours.
Access to retail stores in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retail sales in North America and the Middle East declined by 50-60%.
This led to a 33-43% reduction in walking to shopping centers in March compared to February.
World-renowned shopping mall operators have implemented additional measures, such as additional cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to test the temperature of buyers, and cancellation of events, according to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America.
In January and February 2020, when the pandemic hit its peak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China have lost their jobs.
More than 300 million Chinese migrants were stranded in remote areas of China's Hubei province, leaving more than 10 million Americans unemployed in March 2020 and applying for government aid.
According to an estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus disease in the United States could lead to a loss of 47 million and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. India's lockdown workforce (day-to-day wage earners) nearly 9,000 have been unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a Universal Credit Scheme.
Germany's compensation scheme has also been adopted by France and the UK for short-term work.
Globally, the arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely affected by the pandemic, which has had a profound impact on the actions of individuals involving institutions—including both self-employed and self-employed.
Organizations in the Department of Art and Culture sought to maintain their mission (often with public support) to provide community access to cultural heritage, to preserve the safety of their employees and public, and to help artists as much as possible.
As of March 2020, music, libraries, arts venues and other cultural institutions in different directions of the world were closed for an indefinite period and their exhibitions, events and events were cancelled or postponed.
One of the most recent and fastest failures of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, key events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also faced obstacles, the Vatican announced that the Happy Saturday in Rome, which falls in the last week of the Christian Lint season, was canceled.
Many pastors advised older Christians to stay at home instead of attending Sunday prayers; some churches started broadcasting church prayers on radio, television, or online, while others were offering bets in a car.
As Rome's Roman Catholic priests closed their churches and citadels, and St. Peter's Square became empty of Christian visitors, other religious institutions also closed their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, churches, temples, temples and shrines.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the pandemic, while Saudi Arabia closed the entry of foreign visitors, as well as the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic, since World War II, has created significant disruptions in the world's sporting calendar.
The major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA, the session, and the 2019-20 NHL sessions, have been cancelled or postponed.
The spread has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the activity "will be rescheduled in the history beyond 2020 but will not be held after the summer of 2021."
That's why many gamblers have moved online, and many of the gambling online sites' new sign-ups have increased significantly. The entertainment industry has also been particularly affected, with many music groups canceling or suspending their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as those on Broadway, have also suspended all performances.
Many artists have found ways to work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional lyo-professional, such as the lyo-streaming ceremony, and to convey it to others, or to create web-based "meal" so that artists can perform, spread it out, and promote their work.
Online, many memes based on the idea of coronavirus have spread as many turn to humor and gossip in this uncertain situation.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Chinese and East Asians, Europe, the United States and other countries where the epidemic showed severity, have seen too much prejudice, <0x58>enophobia, fear and racism from strangers.
There have been incidents of fear, suspicion and opposition, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific regions.
According to February reports (while most of the cases were limited to China) Chinese people have been exposed to racist sentiments in different groups around the world, which are justified by the virus to be claimed in return.
There are also anti-Chinese sentiments in some African countries.
Many of the exiles in Wuhan and Hobi have reported differences with them on a regional basis.
For Chinese, both on and off-line, and those in areas affected by the virus have been supported.
After outbreaks and outbreaks in other countries, Italians, the first country in Europe to have COVID-19 outbreaks, may be subject to suspicions and fear of strangers, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed petitions seeking to ban Chinese people from entering their countries.
The hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan has become a trend in Japan.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians living in the UK and the US, have reported incidents of abuse and insults based on racism.
US President Donald Trump has been particularly critical of calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," with critics calling the term racism-based and China's hostility.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzar.
Students coming from northern India, bordering China, and studying in major cities of India, have been subjected to harassment related to the spread of the coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit, stated that China had destroyed nature and "that's why God has avenged them."
The statement was later condemned by the Chinese ambassador in Calcutta, calling it a "smile-knee" and has been fueled by feelings of racism from non-Chinese expatriates since the outbreak in China, calling foreigners a "foreign slug".
Many Paywall newspapers have removed them for coverage of some or all of their coronaviruses.
Many scientific material dissertations made scientific papers related to the spread available to all.
Many scientists sent their results to the server, such as BioRixiv, before being quickly published.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include procedures that detect the presence and presence of viruses that cause antibodies resulting from infection.
RT-PCR samples confirm the presence of the virus, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a very recent or active infection.
Antibodies (syrrhythmia) can also be used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those with so few symptoms that were too minor to report or showed no symptoms.
Based on the results of these tests, the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity present in a population can be determined.
Due to limited tests, as of March 2020, no country has a valid data on the spread of the virus in its population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge difference in how many tests have been conducted between countries.
There is a huge difference in the mortality rate, which is likely to be higher in some countries.
Test on respiratory samples using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be obtained in a variety of ways, including nasopharyngeal swab or wholesale samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours to two days.
The PT-PCR test performed from a sore throat is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, when it begins to grow in the lungs, the virus disappears into the throat.
For those who have been tested for the second week, alternatively the sample material can be used through a suction catheter from deep airways or through cough-up material (shut).
The first PCR test was developed in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at Charity's site in Berlin, which became the basis for the 250,000-cut distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck coronavirus).
It searches for the "E" gene that is spread by beta-coronavirus, and the RdRP gene is specific to SARS-CoV-2.The BGI group in China was one of the first companies to have been approved by the 2019 National Medical Product Administration to use its PCR-based PCR-CoV-enabled vaccine to treat the disease.
In the older version of the test kit, one in three tests failed due to poor chemical interaction, and less than 100 samples were received in a single day throughout February 2020 due to the disruption of tests on the CDC in Atlanta.
As of February 28, 2020, two component-use tests were not considered reliable, and it was until state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the emergency use authority, which began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 across the country.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made available the availability of COVID-19 testing across the country till March 9, 2020.
Quantity limits have not been announced; the collection and further processing of samples should be in line with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR).
As per Mayo Clinic's report on March 12, 2020, it has developed tests for the detection of COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for the test, which could be done in a large number of 3.5 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar permissions to Holographic, LabCorp and Themo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid obtained the EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, thanks to this method, positive results are achieved in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase the number of these machines to 50,000 tests per day, a test that uses a monoclonal antibody that is specifically limited to the nucleocaped protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus.
The conclusions of a review of the written material in March 2020 are that "the radiographic evaluation of the chest in the initial floor is of no importance, but the presence of [CT computed tomography] is possible before symptoms appear."
CT's general characteristics include two-way multi-lobber grooved glass blurring, which includes the disproportionate and back-end distribution.
It grows as the disease progresses, full domination, crazy smoothness and stability.
Wuhan, where this global epidemic originated the most, one study suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, many of its features are similar to the stages of pneumonia and disease.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a first priority for the diagnosis of COVID-19."
The immune response to infections, including IgM and IgG, is the creation of antibodies.
They can be used to detect infections on individuals who have had symptoms for 7 days, to determine immunity, and for those who are under close surveillance.
In many clinical laboratories, the automated systems developed for high productivity will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will be impeded at the rate of production for each system.
For CLT, the only sample of blood is usually used, although many samples can be used to measure strength.
For POCT, a sample of blood is usually obtained by spraying on the skin.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA listed 29 entities that provide notifications to the agency and therefore are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved under the FDA's emergency use authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples in a few hours, so it is much faster than traditional PCR for RNA virus detection.
Antibody detection usually takes place 14 days after the start of the infection, and in early April the UK found that none of the test kits purchased were suitable for use.
Hong Kong has introduced a scheme that the suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube of the appropriate patient to be treated by the patient", he will be able to get the patient to be tested by a patient, send him back to the hospital as soon as possible, and after some time he or she will be diagnosed with the patient's first diagnosis, the NHS has announced that they are starting a scheme to test the suspected cases at home on an experimental basis.
South Korea has conducted faster and more tests than any other country, with the National Association of State Health Insurance Physicians in Germany saying on March 2 that it has the capacity to conduct 12,000 tests per day in general sittings and 10,700 tests will be conducted last week.
When it comes to fitness tests, the costs are borne by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to test 160,000 tests per week.
A drive-in test was offered in several major cities till March 19.
The number of tests conducted in Germany as of March 26, 2020 was not known, as only positive results are reported.
According to the first lab survey, a total of 483,295 samples were tested as of the calendar week 12/2020, and this week a sample of 10,495 samples were tested for the disease (%6.9) in the case of the disease, which was tested positive for 2-SARS-CoV in the UK. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital have only developed a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously.

The Wuhan laboratory procedures were immediately adopted by the Huo-Yan Libertarians located in Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Shanghai, thus in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
As of March 4, 2020, Origami Assays has released open-source multi-anasir designs that can test 1122 COVID-19 patients with only 93 attempts.
As of March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents have become a barrier to mass testing in the EU and the UK and the United States.
Due to this, some authors have investigated the protocol for the sample preparation, which limits the samples to 98 C (208 F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes or chromosomes for further testing.
Such a draw gained traction from both Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection labs in China "HUO--Yan") for large populations.
The lab, which was set up in 14 days, carried out 1,000 RT-PCR tests per day and is the first lab to operate on such a large scale apart from China.
Various testing techniques were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different parts of the coronavirus' genetic profile.
The World Health Organization uses the German structure for low-income countries that do not have the means to make cuts.
The German structure was published on January 17, 2020, protocols designed in the United States to control the disease were not available until January 28, which raised concerns about the quality of the test kits in China and the United States in the early days of the outbreak, and could not provide cuts despite recommendations and demands from countries and Australian health experts.
On the other hand, experts say that the large supply of South Korea testing led to a decrease in the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has boosted testing capacity in private sector laboratories over the past few years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for strengthening testing programs to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing the demand for testing, and putting tens of millions of tests in U.S. private laboratories to a halt, and straining the supply of soap and chemicals to clear wounds.
In March 2020, China reported a problem with the accuracy of its test kits.
Among the CDC-made cuts in the U.S., the government then removed the office barriers that hamper private testing, and Spain bought the cuts from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results were not accurate.
The firm explained that the reason for the wrong results is not to properly use defects or cuts in collecting samples.
Spain's ministry said that the wrong-effect kits will be removed and replaced with the testing kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the tests purchased from China by the state Czech gave the wrong results.
Turkey's Health Ministry Ats Kara said that among the cuts that Turkey has purchased from China, the "mistake rate" is "very high" and "was not used," the UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
In the event of a positive result from testing, efforts to detect quarantined individuals and individuals who were in contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 showed good results.
In the Italian town of Vo, the place where the first death of COVID-19 occurred, the working researchers of the entire population, which consisted of about 3,400 people, were tested twice for at least ten days.
Nearly half of those who were tested with no symptoms, and all of the detected cases were quarantined.
Due to limited travel to a particular human group, new cases of infection have been completely eliminated.
Due to extensive exploration, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic has had little impact on Singapore than the world's developed countries, where there were no strict restrictions such as forced closure of the business of street vendors and retailers.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising citizens to remain confined to their homes from March 28, but schools reopened in time after the holidays ended on March 23.
Many other countries have also controlled the pandemic through strict measures such as detection, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but did not impose more strict lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries with higher mortality rates have lower mortality rates, probably because these countries have been able to detect people with little or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that countries that do not have the capacity to test and national laboratories to combat COVID-19, send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to the WHO's 16 refence laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "% of positive tests" is related to a country's testing policy.
The country that tests only those admitted to the hospital will have a higher percentage of positive tests than the country that tests all citizens who are infected, whether they show symptoms or not, will take them all the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing) is also known as hand hygiene, the purpose of this process is to cleanse your hands with soil, chicken, germ, or other non-essential materials.
On some "necessary occasions", frequent washing of hands with soap in a day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example the skeletal and digestive enzymes enter the mouthways.
People may also suffer from respiratory diseases such as influenza or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucus membranes).
In a day, it is very important to wash your hands with soap: before and after going to the toilet, after the baby's bottom cleaning or diaper replacement, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food, or after touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, hands can also be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization has given the following tips for hand washing:
Before, during, and after meals.
Before and after a person's illness.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the child using the toilet.
Cleanse the nose after coughing, coughing or sneezing.
after touching an animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hygiene refers to the medical procedure to be in accordance with the principles of hygiene.
Washing hands or taking care of them medically before taking medication can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of medical hand washing is to cleanse hands with pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microbes that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or spread disease.
This is especially true for people who belong to the food or medical field, but it is also a good habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many medical benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of diarrheal disease; reducing system respiratory infections;
And the mortality rate among children born at home decreases.
A 2013 study shows that hand-washing habits improve slightly in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, simple changes in habits can reduce children's deaths due to respiratory and diarrhea-related diseases, such as washing their hands with soap.
This simple process can reduce deaths by up to 50% due to these diseases.
Such interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce the mortality rate by one-third from asthmatic events, and can be compared with the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap can reduce the rate of death by up to 48%. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and affordable way to prevent acute respiratory and respiratory infections (ARI). This is an automated practice that can be practiced in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, an important ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, taking the lives of about 1.8 million children each year.
Both diarrhea and pneumonia cause approximately 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to the UNICEF, changing the habit of washing hands before and after eating into a natural recess can save more lives than using a vaccine or medically impeding it, that is, half of the deaths due to diarrhea and a quarter of the deaths due to severe respiratory infections.
Washing hands is usually part of other hygiene items, i.e., water, sewage and sanitation programs (WASH).
Washing hands quickly also protects against diseases that are transmitted directly by mail.
A small disadvantage of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin by drying the skin.
According to a 2012 study in Denmark, excessive hand washing can cause skin irritation, known as choline or skin irritation, which is commonly found in people with a medical condition.
Repeated hand washing is also seen as a sign of excessive anxiety (OCD).
There are five delicate occasions in a day when washing hands with soap is very important to reduce the disease spread through the waste and mouth: after using the bathroom (pronounced or digested), after cleaning from the bottom of the baby (change of diaper), before feeding the baby, before eating and after and after preparing food, before and after chewing meat or fish.
Those other occasions when properly washing hands should be avoided in order to prevent the transmission of the disease include: before and after the wound is healed; after sneezing, coughing or nasal cleaning; after animal waste or animal management and disinfection; and after washing the litter box.
In many countries, hand washing rates are low.
According to a 2015 study by Handwashing in 54 countries, an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. According to a 2014 study, it is the highest rate in Saudi Arabia for children to have a healthy diet - 97 percent - in the middle of the United States - 77 percent - and in China the lowest rate for children - 23 percent.
The compulsory "Health Protection Program" implemented by the Department of Education in Philippines is an example of a large-scale promotion of children's health and education.
The national program includes killing insects twice a year, washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride.
It has also been successfully applied in Indonesia.
The process of removing germs from the skin has improved by mixing soaps and detergents in the water.
The main task of soaps and detergents is to reduce the blockage of depletion and increase the solution pessimism.
Just water is not enough for skin cleansing because granules and proteins, which are organic soil components, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleanliness, however, is with the help of the proper flow of water.
In solid soap, due to re-use, bacteria may be present due to previous use.
A few researches that have studied the transfer of bacteria from solid-contaminated soaps say it can't be transferred because the bacteria only go away with foam.
The CDC still says "Liquid soap is a priority without the control of the hands."
Antibacterial soaps have been greatly promoted in public health awareness.
There is no evidence yet that the use of recommended antibiotic-resistant drugs causes antibiotic resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps have such common antibacterial commons, such as triclosan, which is resistant to organic matter.
So if antibacterial soaps don't choose antibiotic resistant, they won't be as effective as they've been said about them.
In addition to the normality of receptive materials and skin protection, the more effective forms can contain PH regulators, germ-environmentally active benzoic acids (such as lactic acid, lactic acid, etc.) and skin condensers (elevators, vitamins, menthals, and plant extracts).
The hot water in which the hands are comfortable is not so hot that it can kill the bacteria.
Bacteria grow more rapidly at body temperature (37<0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, the natural oil, which absorbs soil and bacteria, is more effective than cold soapy water to remove semi-heated, soapy water.
However, contrary to public belief, scientific studies say that semi-hot water is not effective at reducing germs by hand.
A hand sanitizer or hand anti-septic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the 1990s and early 21st century, the unwater-based hand sanitizer (also known as alcohol-based hand cleaning, disinfectant hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer) began to gain fame.
Most isopropyl alcohols are based on alcohol or ethanol that is mixed into a carbomer, such as carbomer (a multi-cellular compound of multi-acre acids) into a gel-like substance or in a saturated substance such as glycerin for ease of use in fluid matter and for reducing the effect of alcohol dryness.
Adding oxytocin to dissolved hydrogen increases antimicrobial activity. The hand sanitizer with alcohol content of 60 to 95% is effective disinfectant.
Alcoholic sinews kill bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses (HIV, Herpes, RSV, Rhinovirus, Vixenia, Influenza, Hepatitis) and fungus.
Alcoholic sine-teasers with 70 percent alcohol (a reduction in 3.5 logs, equivalent to 35 decibels) kill 99.97 bacteria 30 seconds after use and kill bacteria 1 minute after use from 99.99 to 99.999 (a reduction of 4 to 5 in logs) for other low-efficiency viruses and very effective for a few.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective for the norwalk virus, the most common cause of small intestine inflammation infectious disease.
Mix the front and back of both hands and the middle and end of all fingers for about 30 seconds, until the material, foam, or gel dries.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands with a sanitizer, especially when your hands are obviously contaminated.
The reason for the rapid use of such materials is their ease of use and the ability to quickly kill germs; however, they should not be considered an alternative to formal hand washing, and should be used when soap and water are not available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based saline teaser can dry out the skin, unless the formula includes creams and/or skin moisturizers.
Glycerin and/or other creams can be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
Clinical experiments have shown that using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, including cream, make the skin less flammable and dry, compared to soap or anti-microbial detergents.
In the case of a variety of early illnesses or too much sensitivity to alcohol or alcohol, alcohol-infused substances may sometimes cause allergies.
Rather than washing hands with soap and water, it is less prone to burn-in diseases.
Despite its effectiveness, unwatered organic materials cannot be cleaned, they only disinfect them.
That's why hand sanitizer is not more effective than soap and water for the treatment of many germs, because germs live on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer is largely dependent on ingredients and composition, and historically it has not been very effective.
Among the structures that have been used in recent times, unlike alcohol, overall antimicrobial activity has been observed after use, and after repeated use, perhaps due to the reactions that occur in the skin, its performance has decreased.
In many low-income societies, people do not buy soap and instead use raisins or soil.
Raccoons and soils can be more efficient than water only, but less than soap.
There is a risk that if soil or rock is contaminated by germs, it may increase the risk of disease rather than decrease.
Like soap, rake is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution after mixing with water.
The WHO recommends raisins or soil in case of not having soap.
The correct hand washing procedure recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to prevent the spread of the disease, consists of the following:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
A lot of water is recommended because standing water can be contaminated, while water temperature does not matter.
Rub hands with a reasonable amount of soap, including the back of the hands, the middle places of the fingers, and the bottom of the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research has shown that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of just water.
for at least 20 seconds.
The combination creates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin quickly, and removes more germs than rubbing for longer periods of time.
Rinse well with plenty of water.
Washing hands in the basin can re-contaminate the hands.
Let it dry or let it dry.
Wet and moist hands can be easily re-pollinated. The parts left usually include the thumb, wrist, places between the fingers and sides of the nails.
Artificial nails and semi-trailed nail polish can be a source of germs.
Moisture lotions are usually recommended to protect the hands from drying out; dry skin can damage the skin, which can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Where tons of water and/or soap are not available, many low-cost facilities can be provided for them, such as a hanging container or loki-shaped vegetable with proper holes, to indenture water and/or use ash in developing countries where there is less water supply (such as in schools or in developing countries).
Tippy-tape is a simple technology with a jaggery that hangs from a rope, and a lever that moves from the legs to a lever that drains a little bit of water on a stick of hands and soap.
Drying hands effectively is part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a debate over what is the most effective way to dry in public sanitisers.
Most research suggests that paper towels are better than electric dryers, which are often present in the purification chambers.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a research, and was sponsored by the paper towel manufacturing industry, the European tissue symposium, which included paper towels, hot air hand dryers and modern jet air-heated dryers to offer hygiene degrees.
After washing hands and drying hands with hot air dryers, the rate of bacterial on the fingertips increased by an average of 194% and 254% on the handsets.
Drying from the jet air dryer resulted in a 42% increase in the rate of bacteria on the fingernails and 15% on the palms.
After washing hands and drying with tissue paper, the total number of bacteria on the fingers pads decreased by an average of 76 percent and by 77 percent on the palms. The scientists also tested to see if all types of drying procedures have the potential to cause contamination in other washroom users and washroom environments.
The Jet Air Dryer, which ejects air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing germs from the hands and the unit, and can pollute the environment of other cleaners and cleaners by up to 2 m.
The hot-air hand dryer can spread germs up to a distance of 0.25 meters from the drawer.
In 2005, a study conducted by TUV Product and Umwelt examined the different methods of hand-washing.
The following changes have occurred in the number of bacteria after drying the hands:
There are many hand dryer manufacturers of different drawers, and the drawers have been compared to paper towels.
Washing hands with hand sanitized paper is an alternative in the absence of travel soap and water.
Alcohol-based cinnamon teas contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical hand washing was made mandatory by Hungarian fashionista Ignaz Semmelweis after discovering its effectiveness in the hospital environment (1846).
There are electronic devices that provide a feedback to hospital staff to remind them to wash their hands when they forget.
According to a study, their use reduced the rate of infection.
Medically wash hands for at least 15 seconds, soap and water or gel should be used in special quantities to make foam and rub every part of the hand.
The fingers of the hands should be rubbed together.
If there is mail in the fingers, a hard-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water in the hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly with water and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and to open the back door if necessary).
This will not cause the hands to become contaminated again after they are applied to these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare setting is to remove and avoid pathogenic microorganisms (the "germ").
According to the New England Journal of Medicine report, even in medical environments, the rate of hand washing is extremely low, with a large number of doctors and nurses who forget to wash their hands before touching patients in the usual way, thus becoming a means of transmitting germs.
According to a study, proper hand washing and other simple methods reduce the rate of urinary tract infections by 66 percent, the World Health Organization (WHO) has published a paper showing the right way to wash hands and shake hands in the health sector.
The draft guidance on hand hygiene by the organization can be seen on their website for public comments.
A related review was made by Whitby et al.
Commercial tools can check and verify the health and hygiene of the hand, if such a procedure is required.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that there are five opportunities to wash your hands.
In the presence of blood/body
prior to the outbreak of the disease, and
After taking care of the patient. The addition of the germicide chemical to the soap (“mediated” or “antimicrobial” soap) to the germ-killing work of the hand-washing agent.
A germicide is required where there are many antibiotic-resistant organisms before or where there is a lot of antibiotic resistance. For the operation, it is necessary to "wash" your hands with a disinfectant that can be opened and closed without touching your hands, chlorohexidine or iodine, if washed with a cleanser after washing your hands.
All ornaments should be removed.
In this process, wash hands from the wrist to the elbows, usually 6-2 minutes.
It is not necessary to wait for 10 minutes.
When the water is flowing on the middle of the arm, think that it does not return to the hands.
When the hand wash is complete, the hands are dried with germ-free cloth and surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after seeing the patient or to apply disinfectant material to the hands.
In order to control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, research has shown that the most benefits of hand washing were obtained from the first 20% washing, and that when this rate was increased from 35%, there was little additional benefit.
The use of simple soap was three times more effective in terms of transmission of bacterial infectious disease in the diet. Alcohol-based broccoli and antibacterial soaps compared to each other with a 30-second hand rubbing found that 26% of antibacterial soaps were contaminated with alcohol.
But the H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores are more effective in soap and water than alcohol-based spices to remove them from the hands. In health settings, if hand hygiene and hygiene are improved, it will require the teaching of staff to wash hands, based on alcohol.
More research is needed in this regard on how measures are more effective in different health-related settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is thought to be a source of low cost, good health, and even good nutrition.
However, it is a major challenge to adopt a global handwashing habit of all people due to the lack of continuous supply of water, soap and hand-washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, it is very rare to have a hand-washing towel near a private or public toilet, although there are very few cost-effective ways to make hand-washing spaces possible.
However, low hand washing rates may also be the reason for the habit to mature rather than lack of soap and water.
The urge to wash hands with soap and advertising can influence decision-making, create awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and create far-reaching changes in the way the population behaves.
Monitoring and testing is necessary to make this effective.
A formal study of 70 students found that working in a particular community in LMICs is more effective, while social marketing advertising is less effective. A method of teaching hand-washing in schools is the "three-star approach" by UNICEF.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can reach the second and then the third stars.
Making hand-washing spaces can be part of a hand-washing campaign, aimed at reducing deaths in diseases and children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of the awareness of this promotional series, aimed at changing behavior.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged hand washing emojis to be adopted.
Some research has considered the overall cost of hand washing to be low by ignoring DALYs in developing countries.
However, according to a survey, the management of water and its drainage, promoting hand washing with soap, is much less expensive.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those in unsafe situations, such as mothers who have just given birth to a baby or hospitalized wounded soldiers - was first recognized by two first-person hand sanitisers in the mid-19th century: Hungarian figure Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and the second in Hungary.
At the time, most people still thought that the cause of the infection was bad smell.
In 1980, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention promoted more intensive hand hygiene as a key tool to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu in 2009 and the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 sparked awareness in many countries that it is important to wash hands with soap to prevent such contagious diseases.
For example, posters with "right-hand washing techniques" were hung outside the public toilets in hand-washing places, in the toilets of office buildings, and at the airport in Germany.
The saying "Washing one's hands" means that someone declares not to take responsibility for something or not to say anything.
This proverb belongs to the Bible in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate expressed his disapproval of Jesus' decision to be hanged on the altar, but it was later adopted as a proverb in the English-speaking society.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth is forced to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which shows the confusion of conscience due to the crime of murdering her husband.
It has also come to light that people wash hands more often than other people, after remembering or considering the unethical practice, and attach great importance to hand washing.
Furthermore, people who wash their hands after such thoughts are less involved in other activities of "cleaning," such as volunteering.
Religions also suggest washing hands under hygiene and symbolic purpose. Symbolic hand washing, i.e. the use of soap water without washing hands, is characteristic of many religions: such as Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD> Faith, Hinduism, Judaism, Toila, Netilit<0xC3><0xA2>t Sm<0xC3><0xA2>m, Lavabu Iy<0xC3><0xA2>t<0xC3><0xA2>t and Vayu Islam.
It is mandatory to wash hands after use of toilets in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is important to wash your hands before and after every meal.
Controlling the Risks of Working Places for COVID-19
Controlling risks in workplaces for COVID-19 refers to implementing professional safety and health measures to protect against the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control of hazards in workplaces depends on the workplace and the nature of work, risk assessment of exposure sources, severity of disease in the community, and in workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are those that have minimal professional contact with the public and other co-workers, for which basic measures are recommended to prevent infection, including washing hands, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, and keeping the work environment clean and hygienic.
The risk of median exposure is those jobs that are in contact with people who are not known to be infected with COVID-19, but may be affected by social transfers and international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the public, such as in schools, the working environment in the densely populated population, and the greater number of retail spaces.
In addition to the basic safety measures for infection prevention, there are high-performance air filters for air movement, protection from sneezing, and personal protective equipment if a person is exposed to COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare and the appearance of dead-end workers in front of a person infected or suspected with COVID-19 to be a high-risk, high-performance risk if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures or collect or take samples from a known or suspected person with COVID-19.
These workers will have to take appropriate measures to control the risk, such as a room with negative pressure of air movement, and personal safety equipment depending on the nature of the work.
There are many possible effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace.
Workers may be absent because of the risk of getting sick, the safety of others, or the fear of being exposed to the disease.
Trade practices may change, even in terms of demand for goods and also in terms of the acquisition of these goods (such as purchases, or delivery or draw-through facilities in low-altitude times).
Finally, geographically, COVID-19 may disrupt the movement of goods from areas severely affected by the virus, and a plan to be prepared for and respond to infectious disease can be used to guide preventive actions.
Projects identify risk levels associated with different workplaces and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community setting, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also give way to these control methods and emergency plans for the situation arising as a result of the outbreak, which are necessary to deal with these risks.
Preparation and response plans for infectious disease may be the subject of national or regional proposals.
Reducing the transfer between staff in response to an epidemic, protecting those at risk due to poor health complications, and reducing the negative impact on business activities and supplies.
The community in which the business is located affects the response to the severity of the disease.
The risk management framework is very effective in occupational safety and health, so as to effectively control group risks.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are controlled, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal safety equipment.
The set-up control is to separate employees from work-related risks, without relying on their behavior, and can be the least cost-effective solution to the application.
Administrative control refers to a change in the policy and procedure of the work, which requires action from the worker or owner.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less efficient than engineering and administrative control, but can help prevent some appearance.
All types of PPE should be chosen based on hazards to workers, properly installed, if applied (e.g., the salinity taking device), constantly and properly worn, conveniently cared for and replaced, whichever is required, if properly removed, cleaned and stored, or to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are in minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic measures for prevention of infection in all workplaces recommended include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, including the usual respiratory and respiratory conditions, providing face coverings, tissues and wipers when coughing and sneezing, talking on the phone or other emergency arrangements, if necessary.
The identification and separation of potentially contagious individuals is a worrying step to protect workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have severe respiratory disease symptoms stay at home unless they are exposed to fever, fever symptoms, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medications to reduce fever or other symptoms, and that employees who are sick should be able to see their family members, who are sick.
According to the OSHA, the risk of mid-flight exposure is those jobs that require close or continuous contact from a distance of six feet (1.8 m) from people who are not known to be suspected or infected with COVID-19, but may be affected by community transmission around the business or by SARS-CoV-2, or because the person's current exposure to large international travel to COVID-19.
It also includes workers who are in contact with the public, such as schools, skilled workers with the skills needed to cope with or cope with the challenges of the COVID-19 workplaces, and the skills needed to cope with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, to protect the environment of the workforce, to protect the vulnerable and to protect the vulnerable from the spread of the virus, to protect the vulnerable, to protect the vulnerable from the virus, and to protect the vulnerable from the vulnerable.
The use of the device in the workers of this group at risk is rare.
If a person falls ill on the plane, proper control means to protect workers and other passengers, to keep the sick person separated from others for 6 feet, to allocate a staff member to the patient, and to give the sick person a face mask, or to tell the patient to cover his mouth and hand with a tissue while coughing or sneezing.
When approaching a sick passenger or touching the body's comforts or potentially contaminated surfaces, the crew should wear disposable gloves and possibly additional personal protective equipment, if the sick passenger has a fever, permanent cough, or difficulty breathing.
The gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a bag made for this purpose, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later for commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk control involves a postponement of travel in case of illness, and self-isolation and fever or any other sign of immediate medical attention.
The CDC recommends a short-term closure for schools and child care centers that if an infected person has come to the school building, even if he has not spread the virus, it should be cleaned or disinfected.
When there is a virus transmission from small to medium, social distancing strategies can be applied, such as outdoor activities, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or music classes, or eating in caf<0xC3><0xA9> terrestrials.
When there is a substantial shift in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, the long-term closure of schools can also be considered. Law enforcement personnel who are carrying out their daily activities are considered to be less likely to have an immediate health risk, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers, who have to make sure or suspect contact with people with COVID-19, are recommended to follow the same guidelines for emergency technicians, including appropriate personal safety equipment.
If there is close contact during the fear, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear using household cleaning sprays or ointments before re-using, and follow the standard implementation procedures for using and dismantling the PPEs used and dismantling the containment and washing clothes.
According to OSHA, workers at certain health centers and dead cells are at greater or greater risk of exposure.
The most at-risk jobs include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high-risk when workers take aerosol-making action, or collect or manage samples of known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
In aerosol-forming action, inserting the duct, procedure related to coughing, inspecting the throat ducts, collecting some dental procedures and examinations, or the collection of unpleasant specimens.
The high-risk jobs in the morgue include workers who produce dead bodies of people who were known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of their death; these risk groups include additional control, including separate rooms for COVID-19-infected or suspected patients, including when aerosol-making procedures are followed.
Special negative pressure air movement devices may be appropriate in some health centers and dead cells.
Samples should be touched under the safety measures of Biosafety Level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in specific waiting places depending on whether they are suspected to be COVID-19 cases.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends device respiration for those who work at a distance of 6 feet from a known patient or a suspected person of SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol-making action.
The N95 filtering device approved by NIOSH should be used in the light of a comprehensive and written safety respiratory program in the United States, including proper testing, training, and medical testing.
Other types of respiratory devices can provide better protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend fully covering, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not the body's respiration.
The WHO recommends only surgical masks in place of the entrance screen for the crew.
As individuals who are collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transmitting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-making procedure, WHO recommends surgical masks, glasses, or shields for the face, gowns, and hands.
If the aerosol maker method is performed, replace the surgical mask with the N95 or FFP2 device.
Knowing that the global delivery of PPE is inadequate, WHO telemedicine, material barriers such as clean windows, only allowing them to enter the room that are taking direct care of the COVID-19 patient, the use of PPE is necessary for specific work, the use of PPE, and the use of the same device without the need to take off the respiratory symptoms of many patients with the same disease, the supervision of the PPE supply chain.

Subject: [Covid-19] Lightening weight and preparing for the future
Send date/time: March 14, 2020, 00:24UTC
Lensing: CC0: No rights
We have had some unusual events this year.
The COVID-19 pandemic is one that has made it clear that humans are universally connected and we have responsibilities to each other.
We don't have an example of such a challenge, but we know that our best response is the global understanding, cooperation, and social construction that is the soul of this organization.
The feelings of friendship and attention that we have seen in email, phone calls and chats in all of our co-workers, all of this confirms how lucky we are to be working with amazing people.
I can't be more grateful and proud that all of you are my car.
Last week, someone complimented me for my work.
He reminded me of how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia now, and how strong it is for this delicate resource that online is available to all.
Your work has made it possible, whether you're with the sites or our cars that are paid or our community is safe.
The world needs information and Wikipedia provides it, now more than ever.
This is the moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important changes from this coming week on how we work together.
Changes in our work and schedule
As Robin first expressed, last night's meeting of the c-team to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In this discussion, we looked at what would be the most appropriate response to what we are facing and how to keep the arginution standing at its feet at this time.
We wanted to end the tension for a long time and promote our mission.
If you want to dabble, that's okay.
All staff, contractors and workers:
Work expectations for our daily work will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week, to order a second,
We're not announcing a holiday - if you can work according to normal hours, the mission can bring you to use.
However, nothing can be said about the world at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy a deal, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't keep track of your time.
Don't work if you're sick.
We don't have to say that, but we are saying it.
No day of illness or PTO requirement - just tell your manager and help to recreate the calendar and schedule of your team, make sure all aspects of the work are completed.
(If you get a positive diagnosis for COVID-19, inform Bryan within T&C Ops, T&C can help with support and make sure that the administration pays proper attention to your situation.)
Full payment will be made to friends working hours.
We've said this before, and we're repeating our obligations to our contractors and staff working hours.
Each person will be paid according to their hours of meeting during normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people work in the world around them to change their mental stress.
What we can do is incredibly fast, especially in such days.
Again, it's all about your personal safety.
All we have to do is talk to your manager, let's figure out what to expect from you and then set things accordingly.
No work is considered necessary.
There are some things we need to keep going.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (other than others) work hard, which may require additional support.
We examine current goals with all areas and change our focus to support what is needed for our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we will focus our attention only on all the most important projects.
Slowing down at this time will not hurt us later.
We don't plan to "take action" once this pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work extra time to meet deadlines, which is currently unrealistic.
We recognize that things have changed, and where appropriate we will work to set new goals and deadlines.
What is the Annual Plan (APP)?
In order to set our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we intend to organize our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We want to expand our 2019-2020 plan that takes a lot of time to create a budget where workers will be allowed to change their work preferences, and to adjust their loved ones to those in need who want to work for a short period of time.
This extension of time will greatly reduce the work and pressure of the project throughout the organization.
We will introduce our plan to the board next week and get the confirmation as soon as possible, inform the delegations and the teams about the next step.
Thank you for leading the APC team.
Office status, appearance and cleanliness
Last week, we heard that one of our SF-based friends may be infected with COVID-19.
However, despite being very careful, we have staffed in the San Francisco office for an anti-virus process to clear all surfaces.
He used a hospital-level disinfectant to clean the arms of every level through which we have access.
The building is using its own protocol products to ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be fully prepared at the moment as soon as we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in VWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with all DC office staff members and our colleagues.
Last week, our DC office moved to a remote location, in line with the San Francisco Joint Directive.
As some of us know about the current situation in NYC, we are also dealing with rent in a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be delayed.
Some of our friends are working remotely for the first time.
We know that this can be some adjustments and that you want some advice.
The duration of the meetings can be extended to one or two hours.
If long seats are needed, think about how to distribute them on different days.
Make the meeting as clear as each agenda, and send out the relevant content first.
Make the video a default, with features such as Google Docs and Zoom to use for direct collaboration and communication.
Take the lead in providing support for each meeting, one should monitor the discussion for questions, and one should follow the list of speakers, and one should help to take a note (or note with co-operation).
If you need a rest 10 headset, send an email to technical support.
Use your money to pay for sniffles.
Join the <0x23>Remote Channel in Slack to talk about the work divided by your peers.
The HR functional team is considering the webinar-based aerognomics guidance to collaborate with the distributed car across the foundation.
Last week, we called on all social privilege recipients to cancel Wikimedia's privileged public events, such as the cancellation of Eddie Huttens, until the World Health Organization announces the end of the pandemic.
They should be aware that we assume that our cancellation request and other restrictions may make it possible to complete the activities of their accepted cooperation and that there will be no penalty for modifying or slowing down these goals.
In the coming week, we will follow additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and topical social conferences.
The general sentiments of the entire international community are saddened by this disruption, but are satisfied with the clear ability to focus on their own communities, the Wikimedia community, etc.
Growing up, CRT is working on creating a web page on MetaWiki to provide opportunities for the community to track and monitor their interactions.
Stay in touch with COVID-19-related issues.
We will also invite your calendar for a special meeting next Thursday 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share the latest information, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are here to help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and other necessary information related to COVID-19 on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will store the latest and all other information in one place.
We are working to establish regular contacts with members of staff who currently live in countries that are heavily affected.
If you have travel, events, an important workhorse, a coverage challenge, or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to work with CRT and receive notifications.
We are here to provide timely support and communication.
If you have a secret or sensitive matter, please email Brian Jordan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a reflection of our work and responsibilities.
Rather, they are a recognition on this occasion, our work and responsibilities will need to be pushed into a form that we have never seen in the past.
These are the steps that we understand that it is important to support each other so that we can continue to work, support our movement and serve the world on which they depend.
When the time comes, the work is waiting for us.
After now, helping each other is the need of the hour and getting the opportunity to do important work that will come in a few weeks but possibly in a few months.
To do this, we need you all, and that is why it is important that you take care of yourself and your family so that you are in the best condition when needed.
Now, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J. Dorian D, Gregory V, Jim V, Joel L., L., Ryan M., and Tony S.), and the rest of the team's leadership (Grant I, Header W), Jim V, Jenin U, Lisa S., Robin A., Ryan M., and Toby Ann.
B-injection - enzyme 2 changer (ACE2) is an enzyme that is connected to the outer surface of the cells in the lungs, muscles, heart, kidneys and intestines (cell membranes).
ACE2 also acts as an entry point for some coronavirus cells by reducing the amount of ACE-converting enzymes (ACEs) by increasing the amount of angiotensin II and making it a reliable drug for the treatment of heart disease.
The human version of the enzyme is often called HACE2.
Angiotensin alternating enzyme 2 is a type of enzyme that contains methotrexate, which is found on the surface of endothelial and in the rest of the cells.
ACE2 protein includes an terminal peptides M2 domain and a terminal collagen renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single pass type I membrane protein, which has its measurable active domain scattered on the surface of cells in the lungs and other fibers.
The domain outside the cells of ACE2 is culled from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called scheduling, and as a result, the dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream that eventually exits through the urine.
ACE2 is found mostly in the organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the lung type II vertebrate cells, small intestine intestinal intestinal tracts, arterial and veronous endothelial cells, and artery smooth muscle cells.
The effect of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the brain's outer membrane, body fluid, lower than the small finger, in the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as the opposite balance of ACE.
ACE Injectable I hormones contribute to the blood-closing ducts of Injectables II.
In return, ACE2 carboxyl terminal amino acid differentiates phenylalanine from phenylamine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and binds it to hydrolysis.
ACE2 can also separate a number of other peptides, including [Des-Arginine 9] -Breedycin, Apelin, Neurotincine, Denorphin A, and Householdin.
ACE2 also controls the movement of membranes of SLC6A19 carrying natural amino acids and is involved in mental illness of the brain.
As a protein transceiver, ACE2 acts as a central entropy in the cells of a few coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the restriction of ACE2's enzymatic domain on the surface of the spike S1 protein cells of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 causes the encephalitis content of a cell's membrane to melt into the inside of a cell's membrane, and the transmission of both viruses and enzymes into cells.
In this process of intervention, there is also a need for protein oligarchy through representative serine proteins TMPRSS2, which continues as a probabilistic treatment under current investigations. This has led some to conclude that a lack of ACE2 levels in cells can make it easier to combat the disease.
However, a number of professional societies and organizations have advised not to continue with general ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34 percent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to contraindications."
Moreover, the risk of pneumonia in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, has also decreased.
ACE inhibitors are also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related deaths, although its consequences were less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia."
Human transplantation ACE2 (rhACE2) is treated as a modern treatment for acute injury to the lungs, and it appeared that it would improve the supply of hemodynamics and oxygen with a lipolysed mule acute respiratory distress symptoms.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and in addition to the 24-hour effect, the action begins in 30 minutes.
Numerous results suggest that rhACE2 may be a better medicine for people with intolerance to the classic ren-engiotensin system inhibition (RAS), or in diseases where the circulation of angiotensin II increases.
B'COVID-19 apps are mobile applications that help communicate during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example the process of identifying people who have been in contact with an infected person.
Several such applications have been created or proposed in several areas and constituencies with the support of the government.
Frameworks of several applications have been developed to find contacts.
Privacy concerns have been highlighted, especially about the system that is intended to find the geographic location of the app's user.
A low-intrusion alternative involves the use of Bluetooth signals to transfer the user's location to another mobile phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would collaborate to integrate this type of Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has created an app that allows citizens to find out if they have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. An app called Trace Togidar is being used in Singapore.
The app was created by a local IT community, which was released as an independent source and will be referred to as the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "Stop Corona!" which can detect the proximity of potential victims and provide immediate response to health authorities.
The app has been developed by the Ministry of Information Technology and Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
The government said on April 12 that the link-finding app is in the next phase of preparation and will be available for launch within a week - in Ireland and France, as well as the "Stop Covid" application.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing applications based on Singapore's Trace Toggider app and the BlueTreas protocol - Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 based in Moscow, to ensure that people do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has come up with a number of potential practical challenges in the application-based systems, including false positive results and low effectiveness, if the application is limited to a small segment of the population.
Challenging concerns about the spread of the false or harmful "coronavirus" app, Apple has set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related applications to their app store, limiting them to "official" or otherwise known organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy experts have expressed their concerns about the countless restrictions on surveillance on the coronavirus app, especially whether surveillance arrangements designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be removed after the threat is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for limiting such surveillance arrangements.
These organizations have announced a series of conditions on government projects:
should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Monitoring and monitoring should be extended for a specific period of time.
The use of the data will be limited to the purpose of COVID-19;
The security and anonymity of the data will be protected and must be disclosed on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance must be avoided by over-discrimination and non-importance;
The data relating to a third party must be disclosed under the Data Sharing Act;
Protective measures will have to be taken against abuse and citizens will have the right to respond to abuses;
All "related partners" will require meaningful participation, including public health experts and non-important groups.The German Keys Computer Club (CCC) and the unregistered reporter (Reporter Ohn Grenzen) (RSF) also issued surveillance lists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan from its operating system device, at a time when it will not be needed, is intended to solve the problem of permanent monitoring by eliminating monitoring procedures.
Some countries used a network-based Opportunity Palace monitoring system instead of the app, eliminating both the need to download the application and the ability to avoid surveillance.
A network-based monitoring system was approved in Israel.
Network-based solutions, which have access to unsolicited data from the Opportunity Palace, have the potential for significant privacy issues.
However, not all systems connected to central servers require access to personal opportunity palace data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use only central servers to communicate with each other (see below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to track communications.
Instead of using an excellent application, the system collects surveillance information from various sources, including monitoring data in a mobile device and data exchange from cards, and collects them all and generates notices through text messages to potentially affected people.
In addition to using this information, the government has made the opportunity hall information publicly available to inform potential contacts, which is something that has been allowed due to far-reaching changes in the privacy laws of the information when the MERS epidemic spreads in the country.
This information is available to the public through multiple applications and websites - countries such as Germany have considered both central and privacy protection systems.
Details have not been released as of April 6, 2020.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts were working on a group of privacy friendly solutions, such as Bluetooth's Weak Energy (BLE), which allows the user to access the facility from other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is an integrated effort consisting of both central and non-centralized methods, and is not a single protocol. Non-targeted protocols include: non-target privacy protection location monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), contact provisional numbers (TCN, fka event contact number, CEN) and sensitive privacy protocols.
These protocols do not contain any personally identifiable data from the device and all the matching takes place on the device.
The privacy group at the MIT Media Laboratory is developing a secure path, a platform to use privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The study is based on research by the acronym "Apps Gong Rog: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Pandemic" released in March 2020.The second similar attempt is the Safe Trace Platform by Engma MPC, a privacy technology-producing company that was originally set up at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrees uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising on the privacy of this data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by a number of groups who had the same vision and broadly agreed protocols to reduce the spread of shears so that surveillance and integrating apps can be globally enabled as mutually enabled, which is an important aspect of mass adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had released the BlueTreas app, which was used by the government.
On April 10, 2020, Android and iOS mobile platform-controlled companies, Google and Apple, announced a move to trace communications, which, according to their claims, will protect privacy, based on a combination of weak Bluetooth energy technology and privacy privacy privacy privacy.
He also published descriptions of the original technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
The implementation of these protocols will enable governments to issue government-sponsored privacy applications for coronavirus searches.
Google and Apple intend to address this constant monitoring issues through direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android, so that the first system is distributed through the operating system updates, and later it is removed in the same way as when the threat is resolved.
B'doctoral change (also known as changing the purpose of the drug, re-programming, changing the function or changing the treatment) is to change or use the medical condition of a second disease approved for the treatment of a disease rather than the medication for which it was originally developed.
It is an online scientific research that is currently underway to investigate the effective and safe treatment of COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transmission of Robust plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 viable drug proteins, each of which has multiple sterilization sites.

The World Health Organization has included Lupinavir/Retnavir in the International Cohesion Test.
Remdesivir was developed by Glide Science for the prevention of Ebola virus disease and the treatment of Marburg virus disease, and was later administered by Glide Science. It was immediately discovered that within Remdesivir there is a number of viral activity in vitros, fumos, paramexo and corona-viruses.
One problem with anti-viral treatment is the propensity to resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials, including those administered by two Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with low disease and the other for people with serious illness.
There are three clinical trials in the vein of vitamin C for patients with COVID-19 disease who are hospitalized; two pacifier controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italian).

The COVID-19 vaccine is a vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are expected to be in Phase I safety study by April.

In April, it was said that the CEP's urgent measures for vaccine production are swift, with the ability of manufacturers, deployments, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technology platforms were in research and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Phase I safety studies include several major platform goals:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I manufacturers and vaccine candidates: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Producers and vaccine candidates of Phase I: Kane Sino Biology, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 candidates for the vaccine are in the early stages of vaccine preparation, 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Melcan Institute), and others 37 announced but little public information about them is available (referring to whether they are in the planning stage or are being designed now).
Phase III trials are preliminary safety and susceptibility checks, usually without order, controlled by the harmless drug, and on multiple sites, while determining more precise, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and the effectiveness of vaccine testing for disease prevention, while monitoring the side effects on most doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active preparedness (certified as of early April 2020), 74 were yet to be diagnosed on humans (yet in "previous" research).

Some vaccines have different effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have other benefits besides the disease they want to avoid.
In Australia, 4,170 medical personnel are being recruited for another randomised trial.
It is possible that the vaccine will not be safe or effective in the preparation phase.
Early research to test vaccine efficacy by using specific animal samples of COVID-19, such as ACE2-dosing mice, other laboratory animals and non-human high-animals, biosafety level 3 standard measures to combat the virus directly, and the need for international coordination to ensure standard protection procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, no vaccine or treatment for SARS has been found that is safe and effective in humans.
According to a research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and manufacture of novel vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public institutions around the world.
When the MERS spread, it was thought that the existing SARS research would be a useful model in the treatment and vaccine development against the MERS-CoV disease.
As of March 2020, there was an MERS vaccine (DNA-based) that had completed phase I clinical trials on humans and three other releases, all of which were vector-borne viral vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-VIR-VIRVAC.
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus is known and its vaccines are already available.
In different posts on social media, patents have pointed to the existing patents of genetic seals and vaccines and the other branches of the coronavirus, such as SARS coronavirus.
B'coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include abdominal pain, abdominal pain, abdominal pain, abdominal pain, abdominal pain, and abdominal pain.
It usually takes five days from appearance to the onset of symptoms but can last from two to fourteen days.
Although in most cases the symptoms of the disease are of a minor nature, some go to viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As on 17th April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 mamaks and areas, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered - mainly from close contact with the public, often in the form of mouth-to-mouth bites, coughing or talking.
Although similar droplets come out when exhaling, they often fall on the ground or floor, instead of being able to spread disease from long distances.
People can get sick with the loss of eyes, nose or mouth with their hands after seeing the affected surface.
The virus can live up to 72 hours on surfaces.
It is the most contagious disease within three days before the onset of symptoms, although it is possible to spread it both before the appearance of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is the time-reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for people who are suspected to be infected with the virus and people who are in good health.
There are differences in the proposal to wear a mask for the general public, some officials are against its use, others are advising its use and some are calling it necessary.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries of the World Health Organization.
People infected with the virus may not have symptoms or have symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, frequent chest pain or pressure, mental illness, difficulty waking up, and blue of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
In the upper part of the respiratory tract, symptoms of the disease such as sneezing, nasal sneezing, or sore throat may also be seen.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were seen in different percentages.
In China, a few incidents initially occurred only with chest tightness and soreness.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, excessive organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to several days, but can be as long as two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms of the disease will have such an infection within 11.5 days.
These people with no symptoms are not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may be pathogenic.
The proportion of people infected with the disease is currently unknown and being studied, where the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases in the hospital were without symptoms.
China's National Health Commission began counting the cases of non-symptomatic cases in its daily cases from 1 April; 130 (78%) of the 166 infected patients were ready for testing at the time of the test.
Viral load can be high in both bulk and bulk.
Talking in a loud voice leads to more noise than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that non-Dhanpe kinase drops have the ability to go up to 4.5 metres (15 ft).
Although the virus is not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioresolve transfers may be possible and that samples of viral RNA have been positive in the air-conductors in the hallways outside the person's rooms.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can aerosolize the respiratory tract and result in airborne infections.
The virus is most contagious when symptoms appear in people; and if the spread of the virus is possible prior to the appearance of symptoms, the risk is reduced.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three people.
In particular, a day on virus cardboard, plastic (police propylene) and non-corrosive steel (AISI 304) were found to be viable for three days, and 99% of copper for four hours.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
If soaps and detergents are used correctly, they are effective; soap products disable the protective layer of the virus, as well as purify the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
The other molasses, Heise benzoconium chloride and chlorohazidin gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, samples of wholesale were taken within an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample saw the highest viral load, and the sixth patient saw the highest number of viruses in the second day's test.
The symptoms of severe respiratory distress are corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) acute respiratory disease coronavirus, which was first discovered in three people in Wuhan with pneumonia with severe respiratory diseases.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the corresponding coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soaps, which tear its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the original SARS-CoV.
The feathers are the organs that are most affected by COVID-19 as viruses gain access to these host cells through enzyme 2 (ACE2) altering enzymes, which are found to be the most abundant in the type II of feathers.
To connect the virus to ACE2, a special level of gratitude laxative called a "cell" (pplomer) uses and enters the host cell.
12% of patients admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, were found to have a severe heart attack and are frequently found in severe illness.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is higher due to the diseases of the immune system during inflammation and disease progression throughout the body, but severe heart muscle injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors.
2 ACEs are more visible in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
In patients with an intensive care unit infected with COVID-19, more cases of blood clots (31%) and tyrombombobulism (25%) were seen and may be associated with poor diagnosis. Post-mortem of COVID-19 deaths were observed in lung lymphocyte cells containing spore damage (DAD) and swollen infiltrates.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has side effects for the appearance of ACE2 respiratory tract serotonin cells, severe patients with COVID-19 have more inflammatory symptoms than normal.
In particular, the T-cells with ill-treated SM-CSF secreting were found to be associated with the osteoarthritis and acute lung diseases of the swollen IL-6 ejaculated cells in patients with COVID-19.
There were also reports of lymphocytes intrusion at the time of post-mortem.
The WHO has published several methods of testing for the disease.
The standard method of experiments is timely reverse transcription polymers chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out on respiratory tract samples obtained from the nasal swab; however, nasal swabs or sputum samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but it requires two samples to be taken in two weeks and the immediate significance of the results is reduced.
Chinese scientists were able to separate a variety of coronaviruses and published genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world could independently develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the infectious disease caused by varicose veins.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which detect active infectious disease and whether someone had been infected in the past) were in the preparation stages, but are not yet widely used.
The Chinese experiment showed accuracy of only 60% to 70%.
The FDA approved the first testing center for end-of-month use in the U.S. on March 21, 2020, the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University issued diagnostic instructions taking into account the medical features and the pandemic risk to detect the epidemic.
In the initial infectious disease, double-sided multi-family, compound glass operates, inadequacies, and later disintegration are common.
As the disease progresses, complete dominance, crucifixion (such as the mutant hijab's mutagen) and stabilization may appear.
Some statistics are available about the mitochondria and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results on the post-mortem are:
Macroscopic: inflammation of the lungs, inflammation of the lungs, stability of the lungs and inflammation of the lungs.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Light pneumonia: the lungs become more of a swollen, more of a neuroscientist, large abnormal pneumoniae, with infiltrating lymphocyte cells with cracked inflammation and the formation of multicellular dysphagia.
Acute pneumonia: Decreased bone loss (DAD) due to low back pain.
DA fear is the manifestation of severe respiratory distress symptoms (ARDS) and a severe lack of oxygen in the body.
Pneumonia: an organization of alveolar cavities and pulmonary intestinal fibrosis
Blood: Blood clotting in the veins (DIC); white and red blood reaction.
Precautions to reduce the chances of the disease include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water and washing for at least 20 seconds, adhering to improved respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when chewing or chewing, and recommends the use of the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hygiene for the hands is encouraged after grinding or rinsing.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth to cover the crowd, to limit the spread of the virus from people who do not show symptoms, and the social distancing strategies aimed at closing schools and offices, restricting travel restrictions, and reducing contact with large groups of victims by canceling large public gatherings.
The distance guide also includes people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
Since the vaccine is not expected until 2021, one of the key points to combating COVID-19 is to reduce the highest level of the epidemic known as "fleeting."
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after the toilet is cleaned or when the hands are obviously dirty, before eating and after cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
It further suggests that at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer should be used, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO formulates two formulas for local production.
In these formations, antimicrobial activity is produced from ethanol and esophagus.
In alcohol, hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial veins; it is "not an active substance for fat germ in the hands."
Glycerol is poured as a diet.
People have been organized with supportive care, including fluid treatment, oxygen support, and other important organ support.
The CDC has recommended that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple mask.
Non-conductive membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to solve the respiratory tract problem, but its benefits are still under consideration.
It has been suggested to improve personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and better diet immunity.
Support treatment may be used in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the pandemic, with recommendations published by the WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission for the care of hospitalized individuals with COVID-19.
In the U.S., violent people and lung doctors have compiled treatment proposals from various agencies into a free resource, the IBC.
As of April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical experts suggested paracetamol (macetaminophen) as an important drug in place of abutioprofen.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of spreading the virus, especially in medical environments where such a medical procedure is taking place, such as a foreskin or hand-washing procedure.
For medical staff who care for people affected by COVID-19, the CDC also recommends the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic, in addition to general precautions, contact precautions, and precautions for airborne infections.
The recommended equipment is: PPE gowns, device respirators or face masks, eye protectors, and medical gloves.
The N95 device has been approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has allowed the mask to be used only under emergency use authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but they have no guarantee of the effect of use against a particular unapproved biological agent.
When the mask is not available, the CDC recommends using a face shield or homemade mask, as a last resort.
People infected with COVID-19 are often not so bad that they need mechanical affinity or replacements, but a few percent of patients are in need.
The type of respiratory support in those hospitalized with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied, with some evidence that the arterial drain with high-flowing nose cannulas or two-way positive avionics can be avoided.
It is not known whether any of these two have the same benefit to seriously ill people.
Some doctors prefer nausea when available because this method limits the spread of airborne particles compared to high-flow nose cannula. Severe disease is more common in older adults (in those who are over 60 and in those who are over 80).
In developed countries, there is not enough beds per capita, limiting the ability to handle an increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 in the health system.
According to one study, 5% of China's population was admitted to an intensive care unit, 2.3% were in need of mesothelioma ventilation, and 1.4% were deaths.
In China, 30% of people infected with COVID-19 are finally admitted to the intensive care unit.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) increases in COVID-19 and oxygen becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure-control modes and high PEEP-enabled ventilators need to minimize the risk of damage to the lungs associated with oxygen and ventilators.
There will not be much PPE available on older ventilators.
Research for possible treatment began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the clinical trial stage.
Remdesivir seems to be the most hopeful.
Although it may take up to 2021 to become a new drug, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in the advanced experiment phase.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that volunteers take part in potential treatment effectiveness and safety experiments, allowing artificially healthy individuals to experiment with plasma when a person's life is seriously or immediately at risk.
It did not go through medical studies showing itself safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to stop the spread of the disease.
The user will be asked to enter his/her name and ID number.
This app can tell the address of "close contact" using surveillance numbers and therefore the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If the potential threat is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also warns local medical officials that mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, tracking mobile phones, and large data analytics on artificial intelligence are used to find infected people and those in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who wanted to be coronaviruses.
The measures were taken to protect and protect those who are in contact with the affected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the data collected from a mobile phone space with the German federal government's agency, Robert Koch Institute, to conduct research and detect the spread of the virus.
Russia deployed face-to-face technology to detect quarantine breakers.
Italian regional health administrators said they were informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people were roaming around."
The German government held a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with 42,000 candidates.
Estonia's president, Christy Kjollide, also voiced internationally for a creative solution to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individual people may have difficulties due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side-effects of treatment, or fear of the pandemic itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Life is a complete disaster for the mental health and well-being of people with social distancing, isolation, health stress, mental stress and economic malaise."
The disease can take a slight turn with or without a symptom, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as common fever.
Generally, patients recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or severe diseases recover within three to six weeks.
Pregnant women, based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, may also be at greater risk from COVID-19, but data from COVID-19 is not available.
In severe cases, COVID-19 can quickly turn into acute respiratory disease (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure, body mold, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include body mold, abnormal blood clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Unusual blood clotting, especially in 6% of patients with COVID-19, was found to increase the duration of blood clotting, while kidney failure was seen in 4% of the group's patients.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 showed an increase in the amount of liver enzymes (tranamines).
According to the same document, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were spent in the hospital.
However, in patients transferred to the intensive care unit, the median time of hospitalization and death was seven days.
In one study of early patients, the median duration from the appearance of early symptoms to death was 14 days, while the full series was six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8% while the mortality rate among women was 1.7%.
Later, a medical examination of the dead lungs saw the damage caused by the presence of air in the lungs with the presence of fibromyalgia in small oils.
Changes related to the disease of the living virus cell have been observed in neutrinos.
The picture of the lungs resembles the symptoms of acute respiratory distress (ARDC).
According to China's National Health Commission, 11.8 per cent of deaths were observed due to elevated levels of troponin or movement of the heart.
According to the United States March figures, 89% of hospitalized patients already had some diseases, including the availability of medical resources and the region's social economics could also have an impact on mortality rates.
The rate of mortality varies due to regional variations, but it can also be due to difficulties in the procedure.
Low number of common patients can lead to an increase in mortality.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of pre-existing diseases means that the current mortality rate is low.
The prevalence of severe symptoms of COVID-19 among smokers was 1.4 times higher and the need for intensive care or mortality was 2.4 times higher than those who did not smoke.
The management of Hong Kong Hospital saw a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung examinations indicated organ damage.
This can lead to the appearance of extreme care symptoms after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known that it had long-term immunity in people recovering from the past pandemic.
Depending on the behavior of other coronaviruses, immunity is likely to be seen, but there have also been cases in which positive results of the coronavirus have been reported again after recovering from COVID-19.
These cases are thought to be getting worse due to prolonged infectious disease rather than re-infectious disease.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated as an infectious disease from animals.
Its origin is not known, but by December 2019, the spread of the pandemic was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in Lancet in January 2020, showed that the first case of symptoms appeared on December 1, 2019.
The WHO's official publications reported the first date of the onset of the disease on December 8, 2019.
A number of steps are usually taken to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers change with the passage of time and region, and the number of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time since the onset of the outbreak, and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and overall health factors.
In late 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to deaths from the laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and assigned medical or epidemiological deaths from COVID-19 to U07.2 from the lab without confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the proportion of global deaths and incidents as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9 (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include mortality (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths in confirmed individuals, and the pandemic rate of mortality (IFR) that reflects the percentage of deaths in infected people (verified and unregistered).
These statistics are not of a particular time and cover a specific population from disease to case resolution.
Although not all infected people have antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on how many people have been infected.
A small village with a population of 4600 in the epicenter of the epidemic in Italy, Castiglio de Ada, with 80 (1.7%) people already dead.
In Gangtok, the disease spreads due to the festivals of Catholic Christians, and spreads to younger people, causing the mortality rate to be relatively low, and not necessarily all deaths from COVID-19 have been classified in this way.
Moreover, Germany's health system has not been defeated.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of patients may have antibodies, as measured by blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic on men and women is different.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have shown a higher mortality rate among men.
The highest risk in men is after the age of 50, while the difference between men and women ends at just 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact cause of this sexual difference is not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be one of the reasons.
Gender-based immunological mutations, low use of tobacco in women and men, and the birth of other diseases in men compared to women, such as high blood pressure in young people, can lead to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 percent of those infected were men and 72 percent of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not been able to find out the gender of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in a variety of ways.
Most of the medical staff, especially nurses, are women, and they are at higher risk of being infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19."
WHO President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to corona, VI to virus, D to disease, and 19 to the day when the first event appeared: December 31, 2019.
The name has been chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal type, or group of people, taking into account international recommendations to prevent disinformation.
WHO additionally uses the "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public correspondence.
Both disease and varicose veins are commonly referred to as "coronavirus warts".
During the initial outbreak of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan virus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended nCoV-2019 and nCoV-2019 as a transitive name for viruses and diseases as per the 2015 directive against using the name of the place in the name of the disease and the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released.
Due to the potential limitations of the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers have been using medical equipment such as nose-to-nose rubies and ventilators.
In an example, when an Italian hospital needed a ventilator valve, and the seller was not able to deliver in the required time, a local crafter copied it and made the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial spread of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misunderstandings about the onset, duration, prevention, treatment and other advances of the disease emerged and quickly spread over the Internet.
Humans can spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral growth in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines are approved for the treatment of the disease.
Research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is ongoing by government organizations, educational groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a "solid experiments" to assess the effects of the treatment from the four current antiviral compounds that are most effective.
There is no vaccine available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same source to enter ACE2 human cells.
Three vaccines are being developed.
First, the researchers aim to develop vaccines for the entire virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, can produce an immediate immune response to the new COVID-19 disease in the human body.
Another strategy is to develop a vaccine that sensitizes some sub-genres of the virus in the immune system.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the focus of such research is the S-Spice protein, which helps the virus enter the enzymes of ACE2.
The third strategy is nuclear acid-resistant vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, the novel method of producing vaccines).
These strategies will be tested for the safety and efficacy of the experimental vaccine - the first clinical trial of the vaccine was launched on March 16, 2020 on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine consists of a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that transmits the disease. An antibody-dependent booster for SARS-CoV-2 may have been proposed as a challenge, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are ongoing.
Seven experiments are testing a drug that has already been approved for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of Chinese research is based on the recommended antiviral drug, which will report nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of candidates for the preparation and use of COVID-19 vaccines was under way. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 continue to be tested, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lupinavir/retinoir, and lopinavir/Turkine intervenor.
As of March 2020, there is temporary evidence of efficacy from Remdesivir.
Medical improvements were seen in patients treated with low use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are ongoing in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, we are still waiting for the results of the research.
The medical administration of Korea and China suggested the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute for Virology, although recommends one gram of daily dose, reminds us that the dose of the drug can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization for the use of chloroquine and chloroquine at its discretion for doctors who are engaged in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.
Initial data suggests that a higher amount of rubavir is necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 within the organism.
Nitaziacsinide has been recommended for more veterinary studies after exhibiting low concentrations in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that transmembrane proteins are essential for entry into SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with ACE2 receptors.
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have major inhibitions in studies with or without acetomycin that have prevented the medical class from accepting the treatment without further study. Ozaltamiur does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of Ovid-19.
Cytokine storms can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine is characterized by anti-cytokine strom, which was added to the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after completing a brief study.
Italy is undergoing phase 2 randomized tests at the national level after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
The joint serum ferritin blood test is aimed at combating such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved a receptacle for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release disease for a different reason, i.e., CART cell treatment, based on past-style studies
To date, there is no randomized, causative evidence that Tosilizumab is an effective treatment against CRS.
Clean and medicated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 disease, transmission to those who need it, are being investigated as an inactivated vaccine.
This strategy was tested with unconfirmed results for SARS.
Viral neutralization is an expected procedure that can lead to defense against non-functional antibody treatment SARS-CoV-2.
However, other procedures, such as cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible depending on the antibody.
Other forms of non-functional antibody treatment, for example, the use of ayurvedic monoclonal antibody, are being worked on.
The production of ruby healthy respirators, which are the liquid part of the blood of healthy patients and contain specific antibodies to the virus, can be prepared for early use.
Coronavirus Diseases, a group of closely associated syndromes
A doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, Li Wen Lang, was infected after raising awareness about the spread of the virus and died due to COVID-19.
