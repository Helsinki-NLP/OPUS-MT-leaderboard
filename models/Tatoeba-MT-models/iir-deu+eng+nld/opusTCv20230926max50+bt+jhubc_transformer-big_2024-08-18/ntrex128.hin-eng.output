Welsh's AM (assembly member) is worried about 'mapet-like images'
There is a hurdle among some members of the Assembly on the suggestion that the title of his post should be changed to MWP (Walsh MP).
The reason for this is that the name of the Assembly has been changed to Welsh Parliament.
All the AMs associated with the scope of politics are concerned that it can make fun of them.
A Labour AM group was concerned about the fact that "it should not be linked to Twp and PwP."
For readers living outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means dirt.
One Plaid AM said the entire group was "not happy" and suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said its group was "independent thinker" about the name change, but noted that the MWP could be stamped by making a small change in words orally.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced exactly as the letter u in the Yorkshire English pronunciation.
The Legislative Assembly Commission, which currently drafted the name change, said: “The final decision of any particular person in this regard is to be called by what the members of the Assembly are called by, will certainly be a matter of their own for the members.”
According to the Welsh Government Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission was briefed on the results of public advice on proposals that had received considerable support for changing the name of the Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of the AM post, the Commission supported Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in public advice.
Obviously, AM is suggesting a number of other options, but with Presiding Officer Elaine Jones having a lot of difficulty getting a consensus, he hopes to present a legal draft for the change within a few weeks.
The legislation being drafted for changes will also include other changes in the working methods in the Assembly, including rules for the disqualification of A.M. and the draft of the committee system.
At the time of debate on the law making, AM will get the last vote on the question of what they should be called by saying.
Macedonians are going to collect votes to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular vote was bid to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour describes its province and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, a referendum opponent on the name change, says he will ignore the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zev as well as supporters of the referendum have argued that the name change is only a means to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are decreasing due to declining churches in Harlem
Mr Adams said, “The elders I spoke to about history say that there used to be bars and churches at every nook and corner earlier.”
"Today, everything is going to end."
It is understandable that there is a shortage of bars.
He said, “Today, people’s society is being created differently.
"It's no longer like the living room in the neighborhood where people go every day."
For churches, they worry that the money they get from selling properties will not last as long as the leaders expect, “and soon these money will be gone or later those leaders will come to exactly where they started.”
He further added that the churches may have been converted into proprietary apartment buildings with a variety of people who would not help in securing the remaining places of worship in the vicinity.
"The number of people who are buying houses in these buildings will continue to increase, and thus there will come a time when these churches will be completely closed, because most of them are unlikely to become members of these churches.
In 1870, a decade after St. Martin, both churches were built by the whites of the religious community before Harlem became the Black Metropolitan Community.
The original white people of the Methodist religious society moved in the 1930s.
These buildings were taken over by the black people of the religious community who used to worship at places of worship in the vicinity.
St. Martin became the possession of a black religious society under that pastor John Howard Johnson who led the removal of retailers on 125th Street, the place was the leading place for shopping in Harlem, where black people were opposed to hiring or promoting.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but the clock began to ring after Father Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it.
David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor of St. Martin, proudly called the hourly act of playing "opening the doors of luck for the poor."
The expert who played the bell in July described it as something like this: it’s “a cultural heritage” and “a precious historical instrument”.
The University of Michigan expert Tiffany NG also noted that it was the first hour in the world to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who played a huge hour at the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriveder stated that his place in St. Martin was not placed by any other person.
What happened in St. Martin over the past few months became the complex story of craftspeople and contractors, some of whom were appointed by the church's general leaders and the rest by the provinces associated with religion.
The parish (the pastors of the area) made up of general leaders on the vestry (where the stuff of worship is kept) became the authority - in July the province expressed concern that the province would "demand to meet the costs" for the vestry, even if the craftsmanship and contractors employed in the western province were involved or not.
Some pastors in the area complained of lack of clarity from the province.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by an attack by a shark while diving to catch a crab
Officials say a shark attacked a 13-year-old teenager on Saturday and injured him, at the time he was holding a crab while diving in California on the opening day of the Lobster season.
The attack took place near Beacon Beach in Encinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel, from San Diego's KSWB-TV, said he had been chatting with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, at the same time he heard a boy's voice shouting for help and then he arrived with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he felt like the boy was screaming in the excitement of catching the crab, but then he felt like he was yelling, "I'm cutting something!"
I'm cutting something!"
Hammel said that when he saw the boy, he found that the boy's entire place was broken.
Hammel said, “I heard everyone shout out of the water: there’s a shark in the water! ”
The teenager was admitted to the Redy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is stated to be critical.
The attacker's shark species have not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a conversation with the media that a shark was detected in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles further stated that the upper part of the victim's torso was seriously injured.
For investigation and security purposes, authorities have blocked access between the Ponto beach of Casablade to the Swamis beach of Acinitas for 48 hours.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the UK beauty market
The department store is going to include styled boots, superdrug and Debenhams by appointing expert assistants with Sansbury's beauty product.
Despite the continued decline in sales of fashion goods and home goods, it is going to join the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market with good volumes, these large-scale beauty products will be examined in 11 stores across the country and if the plan succeeds, the business will be expanded to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty is being made in the supermarket, which aims to explore its place in the market after bringing TVs, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its products by bringing in up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing products of L'Oral, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more opportunities with branded products found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also resuming its boutique makeup products, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly - this will increase its demand in small-scale shoppers to some extent.
Additionally, the Perfume Retailer Fragrance Shop will also check out the special feature in Sansbury's two stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second is set to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's visits to online shopping and local convenience stores, i.e., the reduced volume of food sold in supermarkets every day.
Mike Cooper, chief executive at Sansbury's, said people like the department store at the outlet would come more quickly as the supermarket chain is trying to compete with more services and non-food retailers Aldi and Lidl.
Sansbury's has been setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of stores since it brought the two chains two years ago, which shows that grocery sales have been promoted and the deal has been made more profitable.
The last attempt by the supermarket to bring beauty and pharmacy products back to the market had failed.
Sansbury's did business together with Boots in the early 2000s, but this combined business had to be dismantled due to the way in which the revenues from pharmaceutical shops in their supermarkets split.
Three years ago, Sansbury's sold the 281 store of the pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Loyds pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds, followed by a new strategy.
Loyds will play an important role in the plan by combining La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores, as well as many of the best luxury skincare brands.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sansbury's, said: "We have changed the look-and-feel of our beauty products, so as to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also added specially trained colleagues who will help us in giving advice.
We’ve built our brand’s scope to suit everyone’s needs and attractive surroundings and convenient places, which means we’ve reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Reveals 'Narazgi' After Holly Willubi's ouster from <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
In order to focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, TV presenter Holly Bilubi decided to step aside from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal for Dragons Den's Star Peter Jones's lifestyle brand business, Peter Jones showed "frustration" on it.
Bilubi doesn't have time at all for its homewear and accessories brand True.
The business of the two was being compared to Gweneth Paltrow's brand Goop
The 37-year-old morning presenter announced his separation on Instagram.
Holly Bilubi separated herself from her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last moment with Dragons Den' star Peter Jones - so that she could focus on her new best-selling contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have revealed that when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting at Jones's business headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that she is splitting off from her new deal - worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - that's not enough time, Jones expressed his displeasure over it, and that means that the <0x58>uebier has their own home.
The business was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was considering doubling it from an estimated 11 million pounds given by Vilubi.
The 37-year-old Willubi announced on Instagram that she was separating from Truly, after which Jones left the UK to go to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: “Holi’s priorities were truly at the top ever.
It was considered his long-term future, making the brand very moving in the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was very close to getting started.
The warehouse at Marlowe Headquarters is full of goods to be sold.”
Experts believe the separation of Britain's richest star this morning presenter could cost the firm several million dollars as it has invested a lot of money in products like cushions and candles, clothing and homewear, and is likely to delay its start.
It can also end a long friendship.
Bilubi's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for the past ten years.
Vilubi started TRUE with Cap in 2016 and joined 52-year-old Jones as chairman in March.
The couple and Jones, who are on vacation together in Baldwin's TV production firm, account for 40 per cent.
Bilubi has now become the brand ambassador of M&S and will be replaced by Ant McPhartlin to host ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
“We don’t want to talk about their business case,” said a source close to Jones last night.
"We've had some serious discussions and we've agreed."
He mocked the criticism, saying the news media would continue to comment on him, some would consider it "a different job from the presidency" and become very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his show "News Anchor" voice.
"I didn't sacrifice anything."
Kim's interest is in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, a major step was taken by Trump in the first meeting to make North Korea nuclear-free.
But, nuclear-free talks were halted.
After more than three months of the summit in June in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is not waiting for the U.S.'s "consistent response" to North Korea's initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the U.S. has continued to exert pressure to maintain sanctions, he said.
Trump’s rally speech saw his much more optimistic approach.
"We are engaged in good relations with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
In which millions of people are killed.
Now our relationship has been very good.
He said his efforts to improve ties with Kim have yielded positive results - including completing a rocket test, helping to free hostages and repatriating the remaining U.S. troops back to their homes.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach in negotiating relations with Kim.
Directly pointing to the crowd in front of him, Trump said, “It’s very easy to remain in the presidency, but 10,000 people outside the country are trying to join the region, we’ll have about 200 people to stop them.”
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia rocked an island, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need them for the incident.
Despite more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population being devastated, no national disaster was declared, as well as a condition for international help.
“In many situations, unfortunately, he was clearly seeing that they were not seeking international help, so it became somewhat more challenging,” said Ms. Sumbu.
Still, Save the Children, along with a team, visited Palu, but it has not yet been confirmed whether employees from other countries can come here to help.
Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were monitoring Palu's condition and were looking into whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given such situations that come up again and again in Indonesia, it seems that there is no preparation at all for the outbreak of nature in this country.
Although shelters have been built for people suffering from tsunamis in Aach, they are not like shelters on other beaches.
Palu has seen a reduction in warning sirens for a tsunami, no matter how harmful that warning is, it is likely to increase life damage.
Whether it is the best time to travel, it is challenging to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
It is always difficult to arrange for the workers and goods from natural disasters.
The victims of the earthquake are being brought to a hospital in Lombok, which is far from Palu, and it takes at least three days to reach here from the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia’s very bad infrastructure an issue for his election campaign and spent a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko's administration was split due to lack of funds as elections are due again next year.
Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim mascot have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and more than ten thousand people were left homeless, as Christians and Muslim gangs were fighting each other on the streets using knives, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.

Cromwell's statue in front of Parliament recently became the most famous monument, re-recorded in history
Its exile would be the ideal justice for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts created by his radical Puritan followers like his Taliban.
But, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “The ongoing debate on the removal of the statue was full of apprehension that Oliver Cromwell’s statue would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
There was neither any order for the symbol of the English Civil War nor Cromwell made it.
It may be wrong that Cromwell would have sacrificed in the last century for the works of his ancestor Thomas.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorcroft, Cromwell's finest representation is evidence of the 19th century idea and part of the history of an idol that many still consider to be admirable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is respected by many, perhaps because of which most people still know him as a defender of the Parliament standing against external pressures in the case of the monarchy at the end of the 19th century.
Yet, they are considered to be exactly the exact representative, which has historically remained the subject of debate.
It is evident that our nation has been developing since the conflict that took place in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell's statue remains a personal identity that reflects one side of that division.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are laudable and memorable.”
Deadly pig attacked a Chinese farmer, killing a farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwestern China, killing the farmer.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that only his nickname "Yuan" was identified as the man, with serious injuries on his body, near a pig-fly in the market of Lippansui in Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig-crewed farmer in <0x58>injiang, China's Qinhai province, was preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs.
He allegedly came on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market with his cousin living in the nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, her cousin died and it was found that the door of a pig was opened nearby.
He said that there was a very large male pig in the boar which had blood on its mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to Guiang Evening News, her Kazan, nicknamed "Wu", said, "My Kazan's legs were covered with blood and completely injured."
Security camera footage showed that Yuan came to the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig who attacked the person and killed him was not Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was kept locked so that it could not attack any person, although the police collected evidence by taking stock of the place of occurrence.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, there have been rare cases of people being attacked by pigs before.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband in their farm that seriously injured the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a farmer in Welsh, at the time he was on his tractor, attacking the farmer until his wife drove the animal away.
In 2012, a Oregon farmer was attacked by his pigs and killed and made his own food, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that generally pigs are not aggressive, but they can be "dangerous" when they get a taste of blood.
"They're just playing.
They bite with teeth and are very inquisitive...they don't hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The rest of the storm Rosa caused heavy rain in southwestern United States
According to the forecast, the storm Rosa is weakening due to the cold water going over the northern coast of Mexico.
However, due to Rosa, there will be flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern America in the coming days.
According to Eastern Time on Sunday, at 5 a.m., the wind speed was recorded at 85 miles per hour in Rosa, a Category 1 hurricane, and it was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving towards the west coast of the United States. Since, Rosa is about to reach the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, too much tropical moisture will begin to come in the northern regions of southwestern America.
Some parts of Mexico will receive 10 inches of rain on Monday.
After that, the moisture coming from the trough in the coming days will bring heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, debris drifting and landslides in the desert.
Due to too much tropical moisture, the rainfall rate is likely to increase by 2 to 3 inches at some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely to occur in most parts of the southwestern part, especially in Arizona.
Due to the shallow nature of tropical rain, there can be a lot of flooding with poor conditions.
In view of the risk of tropical rain, it will be advisable to stay out of the low-level desert.
Due to heavy rains, the valleys can become risky rivers and strong winds and dust will blow in local areas.
The trough is likely to cause heavy rainfall in some parts of southern California.
It is likely to rain more than half an inch in total, which can lead to some degree of debris drifting and slippery conditions on the roads.
This will be the first rain of the season in the region.
Before the heavy rainfall on Monday and Tuesday evening, there will be some shallow tropical rain in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning.
There will be heavy rain in the four corners on Tuesday and it will continue till Wednesday.
Temperatures may change rapidly throughout the U.S. in October as the Arctic weather cools down at this time, but tropical areas have a lot of heat.
Sometimes due to this short distance, there are strange changes in temperature.
The unusual change in temperature in the central U.S. on Sunday is a good example of this.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the weather will start to warm up and the heat will increase.
Most parts of the Central and Eastern U.S. are expected to get warmer from October, which is likely to be widespread in the southern plains to some areas of the northeast in the 80s.
New York City's temperature is likely to reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, nearly 10 degrees above average.
According to our long-term climate forecast, we are seeing signs that Eastern U.S. temperatures are likely to exceed average temperatures in the first six months of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people on Thursday saw the trial of Brett Cavanaugh and the woman who has accused Brett Cavanaugh of sexual abuse, allegedly committed in the 1980s, the woman's name is Christine Blaise Ford, appearing on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political stalemates were also seen, with broadcasters blocking Friday's latest-minute twist: an agreement engineered by Arizona Sen's regular program. The lawsuit was filed by FBI's Jeff Flake after a week of investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely sure that at a high school party, Cavonaugh had drunk drugs and tried to take off his clothes.
Kavanaugh defended himself, saying he was absolutely sure that this did not happen at all.
It is estimated that more than 20.4 million people watched Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company was counting the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network as well as other channels showing it were not immediately present.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in calculating the people who see in the offices.
From this point of view, it is equal to the number of spectators of the playoff football game or the Academy Award.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News channel, which the considerate host has heavily supported Kaavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all the channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's hearing.
The number of viewers on ABC was 3.26 million and it was second.
There were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen said.
People were very interested in hearing.
On Friday, Flake was the central figure in the drama.
A statement issued after the tenure by the Liberal Republican office said they would raise a voice on behalf of Cavanaugh, who appeared in front of CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, at which time the protesters were shouting to oppose the hearing of the judicial committee.
When he was being spoken abusively, he had his eyes tilted for a few minutes at the time, it was seen live on CNN.
One woman said, "Look, I'm standing right here in front of you."
“Do you think they’re telling the country the right thing?
They were told, "Have you been brought to power to make a lot of women powerless?"
Flake said a statement was issued by his office before the elevator was closed and said that he would be able to keep his full say in the committee hearing.
While the Judiciary Committee was pushing Kaavanaugh's nomination for the vote for the entire Senate, cable and broadcast channels were still showing everything live several hours later.
However, Flake said he would do so with full understanding that the FBI will look into the allegations against named individuals next week, which are being urged by the minority Democrats.
Flake spoke to his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Couns, about this.
After interacting with the Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake liked power, because it was clearly visible that the Republicans would not get a vote without the approval of Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has approved the FBI investigation into the allegations against him.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "politics" over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May asked critics to stop playing with the UK's future by making "politics a game" in the EU and focus on national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May join the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
Right next to his interview on the front page of the newspaper, an interview with his former Secretary of State Boris Johnson was printed in which Boris Johnson tried to suppress his attack because of Brexit's so-called checkers plan, his statement that Britain and the EU should keep pace with each other "completely meaningless."

Volcanic ash found in Mexico City
In the southern part of Mexico's capital, ash from the poppypet volcano has been found.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention (NCDC) on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano and said 183 gas and ash levels had been recorded in 24 hours.
The centre was kept under observation at several tremors and vibrations.
Pictures posted on social media showed thin layers of Ash coating car windshield in the neighborhood of the city of Mexico, such as Axochimilco.
In September 2017, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico, since geophysicists focused on the volcanic activity that is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano "Don Goo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalonia separatists on the occasion of Independence Vote Enveresri
Six people from Barcelona were detained after a clash of pro-independence protesters with riot police on Saturday, and thousands of opposition rallies took place on the first anniversary to be observed to vote on secession in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists threw eggs and powder paints at riot police, which blackened the road, causing inconvenience to commuters in general.
The police used their guns to control the clash and later resorted to a scuffle.
Pro-independence groups chanted "no forgetting, no forgiveness" for several hours, while union protesters chanted "Spain remain immortal."
According to a local press report, fourteen people were treated for injuries caused by the performance.
According to Madrid, the October 1 referendum, considered illegal, has been raising tensions in independent thought areas for over a year, but people with Catalonia's separatist views were celebrating it.
Voters chose a great way for independence, although there were few who opposed the vote against secession.
Catalonia officials said around 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop people from moving to polling stations in the area amid clashes.
The freedom-supporting groups stood there all night on Friday to assist the National Police to stop the protest.
The performance was pushed forward, but he was forced to take a different decision.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narcissist Terminus, arrived with his wife to participate in a separatist protest, telling them he saw no prospect of Catalonia becoming independent.
"Our best year was last year.
I had seen my parents cheering by voting, but it looks like we're stuck now," he said.
Even with minor victories in the regional elections held in December last year, Catalonia’s pro-freedom parties struggled this year to retain influence with many of their famous leaders, whether in exposing themselves or waiting for a barrage for their role in organizing the gathering and continuing declaration of independence.
42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who recorded the protest on his phone to help police, said the conflict between politicians on both sides had been halted.
She said, "It's been very stressful."
On Saturday, Orol Junqueres, one of the nine Catalonian leaders involved in pre-trial prison since last year, announced that they would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"As a candidate, fighting European elections is the best way to return to democratic values and condemn the return we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
LONDON: People who attacked their home in a car have been detained
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been detained for repeatedly assaulting a car at a home in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday at around 19:30 BST at Ballinagard Crescent.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blemings said the doors and buildings of the house were damaged.
In some places crossbows may have been attacked by car.
Menga beat Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's victory
According to the manager of the Ibrox Club, the fast-moving Livingston surprised the Rangers, which forced Steven Gerard to take responsibility for his second defeat in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference that was equaled by Gary Holt's side move with the hibernation in the second half of the match.
Gerard's side remained a step away from the win in this season's premiership and will next Sunday face the leaders hearts who are eight points behind.
Earlier on Thursday, Rangers in the Europa League hosted Rapid Vienna.
Meanwhile, Livingston has been consistently winning the six-game division by replacing Kenny Miller in place of head coach Holt last month.
Livingston missed out on showing his game to the visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead a long time before scoring, at the same time, because of his excellent game, Rangers faced a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but left behind an attempt to score, then Alan Lithgow made his best effort after slipping so that Craig could just stay direct to complete the goal in the header of the Hulket.
The hosts got a chance to play against the Rangers, they knew they could put the visitor in trouble on the set piece.
And that's the way he got the important goal.
Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston opened, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson doing the job of setting up Menga, which made a touch and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, Rangers had consolidated their position, but missed out on home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly lagged far behind,
This pattern continued even in the second half, though Alfredo Morelos insisted on being saved on Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor from his feet and Lithgow flickd from the other Livingston to take full possession of the game.
Crosses in the Livingston box continued to come and go until the goal was scored, while two penalty claims were made after the Hulket's challenge, one on bringing Glenn Middleton and the other on handball.
Analysis of Livingston's "Extraordinary Goal"
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont has been inducted into Tony Macaroni Arena.
The extraordinary performance and result of Livingston.
For anyone, they were great, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectory.
His style of play and personality have changed surprisingly since his return from the top flight, but the most credit goes to Holt's method in which he has given the team a new look since his arrival.
There were a lot of good players.
Captain Halkett was a great player, he saved brilliantly, while Menga kept Conor Goldsen and Joe Warls behind him.
However, there was a lack of learning in rangers.
The kind of fine performance he has performed several times under Gerard was less than his standard.
Their final ball was short - they were only able to cut towards their home side open once - and it was like some wake-up calls for rangers who kept themselves in the mid-table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was welcomed in Cologne.
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29), the smiles scattered but found no benefit.
This is President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's last day on a controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving ties with NATO's allies.
He was caught in controversy on a number of issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's uprising in the EU.
After that, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an spoke about the construction of a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside Turkey, the city is one of the most populated areas in Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, speaking of security reasons, but many supporters rushed to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who opposed Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an - some of whom also belonged to the Kurds - also raised slogans, strongly condemned Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Two-way protests saw a split between those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom regarded him as a German Turk hero and others insulted him by calling him a voluntary ruler.
Road accident in Deptford: Biker dies after being hit by car
In London, a cyclist died after being hit by a car.
The accident took place at around 10:15 BST in the southeastern part of the city, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a walk-in road in Deptford.
The driver of the car stopped the car and gave him first aid, but the man died on the spot.
Another cyclist died a few months ago due to a hit-and-run accident on Children's Street, about a mile from the site of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family members.
Due to the diversion of the road and the diversion of the bus, such incidents are taking place and the drivers have been advised not to venture into such areas.
Long Lartin Jail: Six officers injured in mishap
The prison office said six prison officials had been injured due to a disturbance in the prisons of high-security men.
At around 09:30 BST on Sunday, something went wrong and is still going on at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tournado" officers have been called in to fix the mess, this mess is in a wing that holds eight inmates.
There were minor injuries on the face of the rights at the spot which were treated.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison staff have been put in place to fix the accident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our jails at all, and it is evident that the persons responsible for the violence will be sent to the police and they can be imprisoned.”
More than 500 prisoners are in HMP Long Lartin, some of these prisoners are the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor was attacked by a prisoner, followed by the prison governor being treated at the hospital.
In addition, rioting officials were called to jail in October last year to fix a serious clutter, during which the employee was attacked by a pool ball.
Cyclone Rosa is at risk of severe flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical areas have been threatened after the storm hit Arizona, but it is likely that it is the same one that could affect Desert Southwest over the coming week, which poses a high risk of flooding.
Earlier on Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service had announced that there was a possibility of strong flooding in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah.
The rain on Monday evening is expected to leave Rosa straight through the entire Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained a tropical storm or depression state since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the storm-eged border.”
Recently, the National Hurricane Center model has estimated that Arizona's Mogolon Rim could receive between 2 and 4 inches of rain, with a chance of up to 6 inches of rain.
Central Rockies and Great Basin as well as other areas of Desert Southwest are likely to receive between 1 and 2 inches of rain, as well as up to 4 inches of rain.
Outside of high flood-risk areas, Rosa's rain may prove to be a boon as the area is drier.
However, flooding remains a very serious concern, but drought conditions remain in the Southwest, which is likely to benefit much from the rains.
According to the U.S. Droutt Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona's area is very dry, it's the second-highest-grade drought," a weather.com report said.
First, the storm Rosa will pass through Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
The maximum wind speed of the storm Rosa on Sunday morning was 85 miles per hour, at which time it was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is now heading north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is currently in the cold water of the Pacific region due to which its power is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected that the power of tropical storms can create a landslide situation in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rains are expected in some parts of Mexico, which may increase the risk of flooding.
According to the report of "weather.com", "it is expected that Baja is likely to rain from California to North-Western Sonora by 3 to 6 inches, plus, it is likely to be 10 inches."
After that, Rosa will become a tropical storm and travel throughout Mexico before reaching the Arizona border to the north-northeast on Tuesday morning, after which it will move southwards to Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The greatest threat from Rosa or its remaining parts is to Baja California, Northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest, where there is a possibility of heavy rainfall.”
It is estimated that these rains pose a threat to the lives and livelihoods of people in the deserts due to high floods and landslides in the hilly areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four people detained for conspiracy to murder
A 16-year-old minor was found in an injured condition in Somerset, who was attacked with a knife for which three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were detained in a conspiracy to murder.
The teenage boy was found injured on Saturday at around 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital for treatment where his condition is said to be "okay."
Avon and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were detained overnight from Redstock area.
Officials have also appealed to people to contact them if they have any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump calls Kavanaugh's problem the Democratic Party's anger
At a rally in Whaling, West Virginia, Trump said, “Justice Kavanaugh is a man who has been rejected by the ruthless and derogatory tactics of the Democratic Party.”
Trump says the trouble that Kavanaugh is going through is the result of the Democratic Party's anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleared the Congress for what Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting Ford several decades ago in his teens, while giving a cleanup, Kavanaugh has strongly and emotionally refuted this.
During the hearing, Ford also gave his testimony about the allegation.
On Saturday, the President said, “The residents of the United States saw the virtue and courage of being the finest human being of Kavanaugh that day.”
Speaking to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia, he said, "To vote for Justice Kavanaugh means to vote for a person who is one of the most accomplished jurist of our time, he can confirm the law and do justice to the real record of public service."
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the medieval elections, the President referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh.
"It's only been five weeks now, from the election that's most important to our lives."
"I'm not involved, but I'm actually involved," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for all the candidates who are really qualified."
Trump said the Democrats were on a campaign to "resist and block."
A senior GOP ally told CNN that the Senate's first counting of votes in Kavanaugh's nomination will begin on Friday.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami kills hundreds, death toll rises
Officials said on Saturday that when a huge earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, high-altitude waves began to rise in the sea and at least 384 people died.
On Friday, a festival was being celebrated on the beach of the city of Palu, in which hundreds of people gathered, when the six-metre (18 feet) high waves rose after the evening, it wreaked havoc, leading to the deaths of many people and ruining everything around them.
The tsunami came after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“Yesterday when there was a tsunami risk, people were engaged in their activities and were not in a position to leave immediately,” Sutopo Puro Nguro, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency at Breifing in Jakarta, said.
“The tsunami not only caused people’s deaths, but it also carried cars, logs, and houses and dragged them to the ground. Before attacking the beach, the tsunami traveled at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) to the open sea,” said Nugroho.
He said some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palu.
Images posted by the disaster agency from the plane showed several buildings and shops were destroyed, the bridges were twisted and collapsed and a mosque was also surrounded by water.
The subsequent tremors continued on the rocks in the coastal city on Saturday.
2.4 million people in the area experienced a persistent earthquake.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by the massive earthquake on Friday was nearly 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It was reported that the geography of the city, settled at the end of a long, narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho explained in detail the damage, saying it was "very terrible" and caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
The bodies of some people were trapped in the debris of the collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured and 29 were not identified, he said.
The loss of lives and damage is very likely to occur in Dongala, 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, close to the epicentre of the quake, Nugroho said.
Nugroho reported that the communication system in the Dongala was "completely damaged."
In a statement, the Red Cross said more than 300,000 people were living here and its staff and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
“It’s a tragic incident from the beginning, but it can be even more terrible.”
On Saturday, the agency criticised why it was not informed earlier if a tsunami was to hit Palu, although officials said the warning was to be issued but the waves had already started.
A person fondly made some videos and posted on social media in which it can be seen that the position on the upper floor of the building was giving a voice to a person on the street below and there could be horrifying warnings.
Within a few minutes, too much water started coming out of the middle and even the buildings and cars were pulled away.
Reuters was not able to immediately certify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power problems in Palu and communication lines were cut, making it difficult for authorities to link rescue efforts together.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities have started sending cargo planes, officials said, adding that people still need to evacuate and meet other requirements along with food.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will close in October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
Its very scary.
Shri Doseba said that the World Vision employees at Dongala tried their best to make Palu city safer, the employees were living in it by making tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office, they have seen the devastation with their own eyes.
He said, “On talking to them, it came to light that they saw many houses being destroyed.”
Its very scary.
The relief groups seriously began the process of bringing in goods for disaster relief, with some complaining that external assistance personnel with special expertise are being denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesia’s rules, money, goods and staff from abroad can be taken only if the disaster area is declared as a national disaster area.
But that hasnt happened yet.
“The disaster is still at the province level,” Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said.
“After the government has said that it is a national disaster, only then can we involve international aid personnel in rescue operations but this has not happened yet.”
Even after the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family members in Palu who had not been able to locate were expected to find their loved ones miraculously as they did in the aftermath of natural disasters.
On Saturday, it was found that a small boy was trapped in a sewer.
The rescue team rescued a woman from the rubble on Sunday and her baby next to her was trapped in the rubble for two days.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gandan Subando trained two paragliders of the Asian game to locate the lost, who had been dedicated to it since the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandgi was also among those stranded at the Roa Roa Hotel along with his students.
"""As a senior in the paragliding field, I am also emotionally suppressed."
Gendon said that the paragliding community started its work only after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, they sent messages through WhatsApp to the Palu contestants participating in the beach festival.
However, only gray marks are visible on their message, do not show blue marks on it.
He said, "I think that means that the message could not reach the people."
Thieves looted <0x24>26,750 at ATM in Newport
A Brink employee was pouring money into an ATM in Levy's Newport on Friday morning, while thieves stole <0x24>26,750, according to a report released by the Newport Police Department.
Denis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to put in more money.
When he was busy with his work, "someone ran from the back of the British employee" and ran away with a bag of money kept to put in.
According to the report, many people present at the spot are suspected, but the total number of people present at the spot is yet to be ascertained by the police.
Anyone who has information related to their identity should call the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to this.
About the change, he tweeted on Saturday: “Formally his name will be Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has named it for a while and will use the name for his eighth album titled Monicker, released in June.
The change is being made in his presence on Saturday night Live, where he is expected to start his new album Yandhi.
The show's producer said he had removed singer Ariana Grande from the show who had refused to join the show for "emotional reasons."
Along with shortening his current professional name, West had already pointed out that the term has religious significance for him.
Talking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy, West said earlier this year, “I believe the word ‘it’ has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means ‘you’.”
"That's why I'm you, I'm you, it's us.
This word is derived from Kanye, which means only one, which is this - it reflects our good, our evil, our illusion, everything.
The album shows who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs also has many names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has named himself Love and Brother Love while announcing for the name.
An old friend of the West, Jay-Z (JAY-Z), has also changed his name with or without hyphens and big letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use the military force for civilian purposes.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at the Telltaleco Plaza promised that “military force would never be used to pressure Mexicans.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest in Plaza that killed more than 300 people, a time when left-wing students’ movements were spreading across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youth, grants each month to students studying in Mexico and to open more and more free government universities.
He said that due to low employment and lack of education, young people join the crime victims.
The U.S. should double the funding it provides for AI.
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of research it spends in the region, said Kai-fu Li, a lower investor and AI entrepreneur for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
After several U.S. government actions, AI has made this remark, adding that there is a lack of overall formal AI strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, China launched a plan last year: it aims to reach No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling AI research budgets will give a great start, take a look at all other countries differently, so the U.S. is far behind this case, and we’re making efforts for AI’s next success.”
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said, “Doubling the fund could double the likelihood that AI’s next major achievement would be in the U.S..”
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Hutton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, an investor in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China's finest AI companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that left the highest-ranking American Othello player far behind, and later he was appointed as executive at Microsoft Research and president at Google's China branch.
Lee described the technical qualifications of the previous U.S. government, including the robot-related challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and said who would be the next government to recognize the next visionary.
Lee said U.S. researchers often face a lot of difficulties in getting government help.
“It’s not China that removes academic leaders, it’s corporate,” Li pointed out.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired veterans from the university to work on AI.
Lee said that by making changes to the immigration policy, the U.S. could get help in its AI efforts.
“In my opinion, a green card should be allowed to do a PhD in AI on its own,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
"The way China's National Natural Science Foundation funds the people of the Academic Institute, the same way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations grant economic grants to researchers in the U.S., but the quality of teaching work in China is not very good," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, aimed at involving partners from industry and academics, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month the DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next in which it spoke of an investment of <0x24>2 billion.
For NSF, this investment right now is more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, legislation was enacted in the U.S. that the demand for creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence would be ignored for months.
Macedonians voted to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a work that would solve the decades-old dispute with Greece, due to which Greece blocked its membership bids in the European Union and NATO.
Greece also has a province called Macedonia, saying its northern neighbor is named after its territory, which has two names for the same claim and is already part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments signed a deal in June based on the new name suggested, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said changing the name of Macedonia would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority living in Slavic.
President George Ivanov said he would not go to vote in the referendum and boycott the campaign, raising doubts that only a minimum of 50 per cent of the votes required for the vote would be valid.
The question on the voting ballot would have been: “Do you give your approval for an agreement with Greece for membership of NATO and the EU?”
Supporters of the name change, along with Prime Minister Zoran Zev, say Macedonia needs to become members of the EU and NATO bodies, one of the countries that emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for young people in Macedonia, it will allow them to live freely in the EU umbrella as it means a safe life for all of us," said Olivra Georgievska, 79, who lives in Skopje.
While it is not legally enforced, most members of parliament say they will act according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is needed for a name change in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there was no report of irregularities till 1 pm.
However, when the last parliamentary elections were held in 2016, voting was 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent, out of which 66 per cent registered voters voted.
Gojo Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter living in the capital, Skopje, said, “I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe.”
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zev, along with his wife Zorika and son Dushko, went to vote in Macedonia to change the country's name, so that the country's name in Stromica, Macedonia, joins NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, a resident of Skopje, was preparing a small stage in front of the parliament and laying chairs in front of the installed tents for those who are about to oppose the vote.
"We need NATO and the EU membership, but we want to be involved by raising our heads and not through an agreement," Kavdarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we also have our own self-respect.
If they do not want us to subscribe to the name of Macedonia, then no matter, we can join other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zev has said that joining NATO will give Macedonia a much-needed investment, the unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
After casting his vote, Zev said, “I think a lot of the vote will be positive because more than 80 percent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO.”
He said the "yes" result would "reaffirm our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that 30 to 43 per cent of the voters will take part in the voting.
A second survey conducted by Macedonia's telma TV on Sunday showed that 57 percent of people plan to vote.
Of them, 70 percent agreed to vote yes.
More than 50 per cent voting is required to be successful.
If the vote fails, the first major blow to the Western government's policy in May last year will be to blame.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero forced to defend the entire Brighton to score a goal
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling made a lot of defence against Brighton in the 2-0 win over Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester City, England.
Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker was given a pass in the midfield in the early stages.
As soon as he entered the open field, he made defences with three Brighton players.
After that, Aguero found himself surrounded by four opposing players.
He pushed a defender before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, looking for Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, Aguero beat Brighton Keeper Matthew Ryan using his left boot and the ball went out from his right and into the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told the reporter, “Aguero has had some problems with his feet, causing him distress.”
“We talked for 55, 60 minutes on their game.
Thats what happened.
We were lucky that they scored at the same time."
But, this was due to sterling which gave Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League encounter.
In the 29th minute, he got a goal.
In that game, Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's field.
He pulled the ball beautifully from the left side of Leroy Sen.
He did a few touchdowns before sending away the good playing sterling.
Just before the game's hand slipped, Sky Blues tapped the ball forward.
The Champions League group play will now take place at 12:55 pm on Tuesday in Sinsim, Germany's Rhine-Necker-Arena.
Sherlock Holmes wants to play against him.
After the playoff dispute with the Nationals ended, there was no major reason to insist on another start.
But, the always-competitive skater hopes that on Sunday they will make big scores against Colorado Rockies, but the playoffs for Rockies still remain just a possibility, winning the game they played with the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won a wild-card spot by a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to get the first division title.
"Even though we're not playing very well, at least we can play to know that the crowd and the second-team Denver atmosphere will probably be the highest level game I'll be facing this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in that game? "
The Nationals are yet to tell about the starter for Sunday, but it is being heard that in such a situation, Schazer can be included.
Chesser, who plays for his 34th start, took the risk of a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch at his normal on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander finished 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the President referred to Brett Kavanaughs position around his Supreme Court.
"All the work done by us will be at stake in November.
There are only five weeks left for the most important election of our lives.
"It's a big election - I'm not involved in it, but I'm really involved, because I'm fighting for all the great candidates," he said.
Trump added, "You can take a look at this very, very, very radical group of Democrats, you can see everything that's happening right now."
In addition, they are trying to seize power by using other necessary means, which you know is meaningless and useless.
To get power and control, they don’t care who is sad, who is capable of it, they just want power and control, but we won’t let that happen.”
He said the Democrats' campaign was "anti-terror and obstruction."
“Besides, you can see what has happened in the last four days, the democrat anger you saw and also how mean and bad they are.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and referred to the name of Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, which was strongly appreciated by the audience.
"Remember his answer?"
Have you leaked the document?
What?
No, I'm waiting for the thing - whose body language was really bad - such a bad body language I've seen for the first time."
Working is no longer a broad church.
It is not acceptable for those who speak their minds
When the workers who pushed my local party voted for me to choose, it was a huge surprise for me.
After all, I’m the newest among those Labour MPs whose importance has been greatly diminished – we can’t say all the things of our mind.
My MP colleague Joan Ryan was also here because he also raised his voice for anti-socialism.
In my case, Sensor Motion condemned me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, there were inherently similar problems on which Jeremy disagreed with the senior leaders.
For the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was said that “we wish that all things be included in the meeting and these are beneficial.”
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, I mostly saw that the Friday Night GC meeting was exactly the same.
Regrettably, many meetings today do not agree and or promise that the politics of “compassionate and virtuous people” are actually forgotten, here too.
It is evident that if the views in the Labour Party are different, they are not tolerated and for every consideration it is decided whether it is permissible for the party leadership or not.
It started here soon after Jeremy became leader, the colleagues I had previously thought were political opinions like me, expecting me to turn away from my words and work in positions I could never agree with - whether it was national security or the single market of the EU.
Whenever I raise my voice for the public - and it really doesn't matter what I said - bad words are seen on social media, sharp comments are made on it, center politics are condemned and I am told that I am not worthy of the Labour Party.
Plus, it’s not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are related to politics.
I know how businesses work and I am dedicated to colleagues who always face sex-related or racial abuse, but don’t shy away from raising voice.
There are many frustrating aspects in today's political age, one of which is how to normalize levels of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that it was important for the Labour Party to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad church and every proposal of “distrust” or changes in the party’s selection rule have been greatly reduced.
Over the past two years, many people have advised me and urged me to remain silent, not to speak too much, and then I will "believe".
But I wasnt involved in politics for that.
32 years ago when I was engaged in labour as a school student, I was encouraged to oppose the Thatcher government, I was told to give up my school’s wider classroom altogether, I demanded better public services to those who need it most — whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden any of my politics, including the politics of the last election.
There is no one in Nottingham East who has any doubt about my policy position and any area that disagrees with my current leadership.
To all those who promoted the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that harms homes, businesses and our public services, I do not feel it necessary for the Labour Party to waste its time and energy in showing its integrity.
But, in fact, I have a message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my supporters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud of the fact that I am serving you and I promise that I cannot create any untouchability risk or political campaign barriers in my work, I am only interested in the things that you all are interested in.

Iron 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Iron Top Reach
The two attempts made late may have had some impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ire Tenant deserved the win in this best entertaining match of the Premiership.
Now they are only at the top of the ten undefeated side table.
In the end, his defense was excellent, he found the best opportunity he could get, which made him take the home team forward and give coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
“We thoroughly investigated our game and we are still unbeaten, so it makes me happy.”
Robin Christie of Melrose reported: “The credit goes to Ire, who redeemed his opportunity as much as possible.”
With Grant Anderson's 14th minute effort, Frazier Klimmo came to the fore, but the Warriors were given a yellow card to Scotland's Rory Hughes for the game, which gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Bagen squandered a very difficult effort.
With the help of a penalty just before half-time, Climo extended the ir, he scored and then tried to isolate the match 17-5 for the ir at the time of the break.
But Melrose improved in the second half and Patrick Anderson's effort was turned into a goal by Baggot, reducing Leve's five points.
After that, Ruridih Knott suffered a serious injury that had to stop the game for a long time, was pulled out, then after the start of the game, Ir went ahead and made an effort through Stafford McDowell, which Climo turned into a goal.
At the time, Ir's captain Blair McFerson had a yellow card, and after that, due to too much pressure at the end of the game, Melrose made an effort to extra-man Bruce Colvin who failed to redeem him.
However, the hosts were left behind and when Stroun Hutchinson got a yellow card from the penalty line-out as he faced Billa Ball's climo, McFarson pulled the Irish out of the back.
After Kelly Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent off Flanker Gregor Henry for the home side's fifth attempt, Climo turned it into a goal, as they could when the game resumed.
The game's stars are still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Game star Ford Kiran is still looking for ways to go into the hospitality industry, shortly after it was discovered that he was selected for the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack is associated with the famous BBC show Jarvis, in which he works as a writer and has been a part of a much-anticipated comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
The duo have reported that the upcoming ninth series will be their last series in the show world, and it seems that Kirron is planning what to do after Craiglaang.
On the basis of the official record list, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kirron was looking to join an "extreme restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
'We have a right to the sea': Land-restricted Bolivia hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific
A large-scale patrolling is taking place in the Naval Headquarters of the Army-Navyak La Paz.
The ossian-blue flag is being hoisted on government buildings.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to Amazon has a slogan here: "We have a right to the sea."
It is our duty to get it back."
Bolivia, which lost to Chile in the terrible conflict for land in the 19th century, is still desperate to get its land - they want to wave their address to the Pacific once again.
Now he hopes to be able to recapture his Bolivian land decades ago, as it awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“There’s a lot of enthusiasm now in Bolivia, a sense of unity and peace, and a positive outcome to the hopes of the people here,” said Roberto Calazila, Bolivia’s diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's big decision on the big screen across the country, hoping that the decision from the Hague's court will be in favour of Bolivia - which has been in talks for decades - that Chile has been forced to return Bolivia's land to the sea.
Bolivia's best president, Evo Morales - who is set to face a controversial contest in next year's re-election - has also expressed positivity in Monday's ruling.
Last August, he had said, “We are very close to getting the Pacific Ocean back.”
But, some analysts are assuming that the court's decision will not be in Bolivia's interest - and if the decision comes in its interest, there will be a lot of conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the right to reward the province of Chile, and it has decided that the possible outcome of the talks will not be determined.
Chilean expert Pazz Zaret told the International Court of Justice that the ICJ's decision would come six months after the final talks, indicating that the case was "not complicated."
In addition, different from Bolivia's terms, the last four years seem to have come to an old position again.
“The issue of access to the sea has been halted by Bolivia’s current government,” said Jarrett.
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement had put an end to Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate certain conditions, but this time it will be very difficult to negotiate after the decision is reached.
The ambassadors of the two countries have not been living in each other's country since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, who is in Hague, has denied that the court's ruling was unusually swift.
He said Monday would be an "excellent opportunity" for Bolivia to open new avenues of relations with Chile and "to end 139 years of disagreements on mutual benefit."
Calazila has denied that Morales — who is still one of Latin America’s most famous presidents — was doing politics over the maritime problem.
“Bolivia will never back down for its right of access to the Pacific Ocean.”
"The decision is a chance to go on what we needed to do in the past."
North Korea says it will not stop its nuclear inspection until it trusts the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will not destroy its nuclear bomb until it trusts Washington.
Rei delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit between the leaders of other countries in Singapore.
He remarked that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo felt he was about to resume nuclear diplomacy after more than three months of promises made by North Korean Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Rei said it was a "pipe dream" that would lead to a North defeat from sanctions and U.S. objections to declaring an end to the Korean War.
Washington is wary of agreeing to an already important disarmament campaign without Pyongyang's announcement.
Kim and US President Donald Trump both wish that there will be another summit.
But, it is entirely doubtful that Pyongyang is serious about ending the inspection of the nuclear bomb as they do not want to jeopardize the security of the country.
Pompeo is planning to go to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit to be hosted by both Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show featured a variety of new-designed headwear for your nearest High Street
If you have to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from sunlight, there is no need to wait any longer.
Both Valentino and Thomas Brown designers have created a series of excellent headwear for their SS19 collections on the runway, which appeared at the famous Paris Fashion Week of Special Style.
The best beneficial hats are made to avoid the heat of this year and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to show on the show.
The finest hats made by Valentino were quite large, decorated with wings-like wide brim that hung around the head of the model.
The second accessory with a much larger side included watermelon hats, wizard hats, and pineapple design hats made of bezel design - but they're not designed to protect your head from frost.
Thomas Brown also showed a special kind of design masks - and these can only be used in time for Halloween.
People were surprised to see many colourful masks and things like handicrafts were seen more than the Haute Couture.
One creation saw all kinds of items for scuba diving, including snowballs and glasses, while the other creation saw a design with melted ice cream cone.
Also, if you've seen a lot of bigger fashion - then you're lucky.
The style-watching hobbyists estimate that this great collection will soon reach the fine shops around you.
A very large sized hat will be available with La Bomba designed heel, from two-foot wide brim straw hat Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Behind the finest effective hat was the clatter label that looked pretty, with the second creation catwalk posted on social media - showing the model wearing a swimming suit on the straw beach bag.
The Bernt Orange Raffia Bag was trimmed with Raffia Fringing and had a white leather handle, the best attraction of Jacqueline's La Rivera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion celebrity Luke Armitage told the FEMALE: “I hope big hats and beach bags will come to stores soon for the coming summer season – as designers have been so impressed by this that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.”
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for citizens of foreign countries
Scotland's private schools keep track of the track record of best education, and it has continued to deliver excellent test results since 2018, strengthening individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other community efforts.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are associated with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), under whose leadership these schools are trying to provide the best service to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are providing benefits to citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector that can build and implement a school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages in schools continue to be a popular and desired subject choice.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, you become the best for him.”
If you speak to him in his own language, he feels very good to his heart."
When we want to build a relationship and trust people from other countries, we think we can rely more on English.
In this year's exam results, we can see that languages with the highest pass rates in private schools are at the top of the league table.
68% of them are students who have obtained the highest grade A in foreign languages.
Data collected by 74 member schools of SCIS can be seen in 72 percent of students secured highest grade A in Mandarin language, while 72 percent students in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent of students received Spanish Language Grade A.
This shows that Scotland’s private schools are collaborating in foreign languages, giving children and young people the skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now being included in the private schools curriculum as an optional subject and other things like STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers struggled a lot to hire employees in vacant positions, with 17 percent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming mandatory to have more and more language skills to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential to work anywhere in the world due to the high potential employment opportunities that require language.
Regardless of the career choice, if people have learned another language, then such skills will definitely benefit them in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreign people, being a multilingual person will lead you to the competition by yourself.
More than 4,000 adults in the UK participated in the YouGov survey in 2013, according to which 75 per cent of people did not speak enough foreign languages, and French was the only subject that 15 per cent of people could speak and it was the only language to reach double-digit percentage.
This is why it is important to invest in teaching language to children today.
Having knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will enable children to get better opportunities for finding the right jobs.
The languages taught in every school in Scotland will be different.
There are also a lot of schools that will focus on more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages whose approach is towards 2020 and are considered the most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of whether your child is interested in learning any language, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and they will also get the staff who teach it.
Scotland’s private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills they need for success, so that they can move forward in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot be ruled out that it is very important to learn languages in the country for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be accepted as "international communication skills."
Young people in Scotland will continue to be given the option to choose this option, diversity and excellence by private schools.
I'm going to be fair to him.
John Edward, director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron made his debut in San Diego on Sunday as part of Lakers
Now the waiting time for LeBron James' fans is over as they are going to play their first match for the Los Angeles Lakers very soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James has been chosen as the preseason opener to play against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it remains to be decided how many minutes they will play.
"They will play at least one minute and more than 48 minutes," Lakers told the official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to be ready for the preseason game.”
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
In Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump held a lot of rallies for the campaign tonight.
Next week, Trump has set five more rallies, including Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other favourable venues.
With a ban on the vote set in his election for appointment to the Supreme Court vacant post, Trump's goal is to seek help for the upcoming mid-term election as Republicans are at risk of falling out of Congress' control at the time of the vote count in November.
When will Trump's rally in West Virginia take place tonight and how will you be able to watch it online?
The timing of Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia has been fixed at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump may deliver a speech on this week's hearing for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, with the confirmation of an expected Senate vote for a week during the FIT investigation due to allegations of sexual offenses against Kavanaugh.
But the main goal of this tense period of rallies is to help the Republicans face the November elections.
"These five rallies scheduled for next week are aimed at instilling enthusiasm among the volunteers and supporters as a Republican effort to protect and increase their stalled majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Trump said during the campaign.
According to Reuters, a spokesman who has been removed from Trump's campaign said, "Congress control has become so important to their agenda that the president will only visit states where our campaign season will be very busy."
According to West Virginia Metro News, “Dedicated in Wesbanko Arena of Whaling, tonight’s rally can bring the attention of supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania to the Pittsburgh media.”
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia since he received more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is coming forward to help the trailing candidate Patrick Morris in the West Virginia Republican Senate survey.
According to Reuters, Simon Haider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said, “If the president is trying to lead Morris in the election, that’s not a good sign for him.”
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show willingness to compete to maintain expectations of being at the top of the Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon in the fourth session will get the result of what is going to happen in this rider cup.
The cycle of time is a completely new concept for the players, but it cannot be predicted in competitions such as when the player is ahead and who is to be trusted.
So, what will they say about this momentum now?
"He had a six-point lead that's now four, so I think we've got to increase our momentum a little bit," Jordan Spieth said as he walked through the day.
Of course, Europe benefited and took 12 points in the game and moved ahead by four points.
According to Spieth, the American feels they have a few chances left and a lot to encourage, not only from the form of Spieth but also from the form of Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both scored three points out of four of their games.
Spieth is deadly to everyone from T to Green and is also the best in the game.
As his game progressed, the people cheered cheerfully, as he and Thomas went two more points down after two more points, making significant putts to complete the four all-square.
It was because of his put that his team came in 15th position with the same screen, the sort that tells you that you don't consider the American team out of it.
"You just have to play really well and take care that the win is yours,"" said Spieth."
That's what they say to all the players who are out of the game.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, are making history in the Ryder Cup.
Europe's different-style but better-off couple achieved four points in four and are at the forefront.
Saturday afternoon was the only pair that didn't shoot any bogies, but they stayed away from bogeys until Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning before 9 a.m.
On Sunday, that run and the way to get that run got in this dominant crowd and from this strong crowd as if they were a bettering player, and there was no player who could turn the European team's possible victory into a defeat that seemed to be ahead of the golf national's sunset compared to the Fleetwood or Molinari.
It is good that the two are on different paths.
However, the dignity of the Europeans has been talked about long ago.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for Foreball's hero Sergio Garcia in the morning, at the time their pair was made with Alex Noren.
In front of nine dogs, a bogie and two doubles were hollered by Spaniard and Swed, before they could never reach here.
However, there was no one present on Sunday who could help you reach your hole.
Foreball and Foursome were great on the lookout as the interaction between the pairings was great, he advised that they do not need to seek advice and are well aware of how to change the strategy.
As a team, Europe played very well and took a significant lead in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the team USA has the ability to compete in a way that, especially in the States side, is skeptical.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe took a 10-6 lead.
Europe will take advantage of it well on the last day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 lead over the United States on Saturday.
The best duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took a lead over Tiger Woods, who were struggling with two wins, so that they could outrun their match by four points from Le Golf National.
To avenge his loss of the trophy two years ago in Hazeltin, Thomas Bjorn was dominated by the American side's misfire at the European Side Morning Foreball, giving him a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. showed greater resistance in the foursome, winning two matches, but they could not avoid losing.
Jim Furick's side needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles match to maintain the trophy's victory.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinary started with "Mollywood" after the Sensational Weekend, they are the second pair to have won four points in their opening four matches in the Ryder Cup history.
After losing to Woods and Patrick Reid in the foreball, they again beat the best player Woods and American Ruchi Brayson Deshambu by 5 and 4 points in a better performance than ever before.
Woods, who put himself ahead by two matches on Saturday, has now lost 29 of his matches foreball and foursomes and 19 of seven of his rookies.
In the rest of the morning foreball, Justin Rose, along with his parter Henrik Stansson, returned to the fore and beat world number one and three-ranked Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeca 2-1.
However, Pleasant in the South West of Paris, Brezie Day had no break from Europe.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas on Saturday set a benchmark for the US by scoring two points.
He had a 2-1 win over Spain's John Reham and Ian Poulter in the foreball and sent back Pauls and Rory McLarenoy 4-3 in the opening two holes.
This has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup when a team came back from a singles match with four points, although the kind of need that was on the side of Furyk drew everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, the counter-attack that will take place on Sunday after remaining second-best for two days is going to be as different as their old game.
North Korea has said that "there is no way" disarmament will only be one side that cannot be trusted.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday the United Nations has continued sanctions that relied on its distrust in the United States and showed no way in which the country would stop monitoring its nuclear bombs only under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body's Annual General Assembly last year that North Korea had tried several ways that were linked to "significant goodwill practices," such as stopping nuclear bombs and missile tests, demolishing the testing site of a nuclear bomb, and promising not to pursue the task of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we have not received any response from the US for this,” he said.
“There will be no confidence in our national security without relying on the U.S. in any way and in such situations there is no way we can initiate unilateral disarmament.”
While Rei reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea are about Washington’s “step-by-step” approach to disarmament, under which North Korea will gradually gradually gradually benefit gradually, it is clear from his statement that this unilateral disarmament cannot be left alone by one side because Pyongyang has done so before.
For the first time, at a summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader serving in Singapore on June 12, Rei referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, at which time Kim pledged to work towards "disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has been demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to end strict international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. has first emphasized disarmament and raised the level of pressure of sanctions so that it can forcefully achieve its objective, and at the same time, it has also objected to the “declaration of the end of the war.”
"Resistance can tilt us, such a perception is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us.
But the problem is that with continued sanctions, our confidence is going to go down even further.
Rei did not discuss the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, saying the U.S. leader had spoken about the merits of the United Nations last week.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and further stated: “If the party is South Korea and the U.S. is not for this disarmament problem, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula will not be involved in such a standoff.”
Still, Rei's speech was very different from last year's speech when he said about the U.N. National Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. Mainland with North Korea's rocket after Mr. Evil President Trump called the "rocket man" on the suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim's courage to be lifted for disarmament but said there is still a lot of work to do and sanctions will remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump reported that he had no timeframe set for it, “if it takes two years, three years, or even five years – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia have been arguing that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps to be taken by the UN Security Council.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: “The Security Council sanctions should remain in effect until we realize that we are completely, last and verified disarmament without any failure.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to fund Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Rei at the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would go to Pyongyang again for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not good.
They returned from Pyongyang in July and said the work had progressed, with only a few hours after North Korea condemned them for "gangster-like demands."
At this month's Moon meeting, North Korea vowed to destroy the missile site and if the United States adopts "consistent measures," it would also destroy the nuclear complex.
He pointed out that Kim had promised him "consistent measures," seeking a guarantee of the security of Trump's resolve in Singapore and that he moved on to normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking courses for a comfortable job
Harvard University has launched a new course this year for all its undergraduates who want to get more and more rest while competing in the growing Macho culture for study through caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters'.
The teacher who teaches the students of the world's number one university often has no choice when it comes to exactly what to do to relax himself.
Charles Cazisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course for which he believes it is the first of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the impact of low sleep on teaching time, he came up with the idea of starting this course.
She told The Telegraph, “I got a girl at the end of the year and she said: ‘Why do I say that every time I have to go to the next class next year?’
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep – which shocked me.
This year, for the first time, students will come to know how good sleep is important in studying and writing and athletic performance, besides improving their general health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said students do not sleep enough every week, for which the university decided to start the course.
The hours-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room, where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books to tell what effect will be on caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleep time in routine.
In the second section, participants will be told that lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with an interactive icon will be shown, then the participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But, we believe they should be aware of this - just as smoking has an impact on health.
He said that while the culture of feeling proud of the ‘whole night’ reading still exists, modern technology and increasing pressure on students means they have to sleep less which has become a growing problem.
Whether or not you sleep in sufficient and good sleep is like a “secret weapon” of the students, it can help them cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – it also protects them from the impact on weight as their brain always thinks about hunger due to lack of sleep which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Jessler build the course, he completed his last year's class at Harvard last year.
He said that due to the course, he became aware and motivated for the campus-wide course.
In the future, he hopes that all postgraduate students will be considered necessary to complete this course before joining a competitive institute.
Pro Jessler suggested that students should consider setting alarms before going to sleep, at the same time, they should also decide when to wake up, and they should be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' emanating from the electronic screen and the LED light, which can put too much circadian on them which causes sleep problems.
Livingston's 1 - 0 against Rangers: Menga scored against Gerard
Rangers faced trouble in another match due to Dolly Menga's strike, putting the responsibility for Livingston's 1-0 win on the wrong side of Steven Gerard.
After a 4-1 win in a match at St Johnston in February, the Ibro Side was looking for their first win, but Gary Holt's team instigated Gerard as the manager for a second defeat in 18 games to get the Landbrooks Premiership leader Hurts out by eight points.
Menga did strike for seven minutes before half-time and after that the Rangers line-up short didn't even get a chance to equalize the game once.
However, Rangers have now fallen to sixth place in the rankings, with Livingston reaching third and trailing only the hibernation due to goal difference.
In addition, the game can be even more troublesome for Rangers since Lynsman Calum Spence's head wound has been treated after the object has been clearly thrown to the other end.
The eight changes made to Gerard's side gave the previous Irish a chance to enter the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was included in the same Live 11 that took a point of hearts last week and the way they drilled well caused trouble to the opposition team at every turn.
Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than them.
When Menga first let-off and sent Scott Peteman to Alan McGregor's goal, he should have given him just two minutes, but the midfielder squandered his big chance.
When Keagan Jacobs, who was in the deep, did a free-kick, the kick went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgo, who was on the back post, could only side the stab.
Rangers gained control, but they had more confidence in their game than they had in the final third.
Of course Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have put a penalty on quarter-over Mark as he and Steven Lovelace clashed with each other, but referee Steven Thomson had rejected Columbine's appeal.
Rangers saved two shots on the target in the first-half, but Ibro's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hit hard by the strike of Lasana Colibali's header and Twi OV Ejaria.
However, in the 34th minute, Livi's opener could go against the run-off game, but no one can deny that he alone deserves the award.
Even then, the best player in Rangers Deep could not touch Jacob.
When Deccan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson kept Menga quiet to pick up for a simple finish.
When Gerard swapped Col<0xC3><0xA9>bele for Ryan Kent and switched to show immediate effect as soon as he was slotted by winger in Morelos, he took a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line while running great.
But, Livingstone showed the visitor the kind of game they could really enjoy, he embraced the long ball with Lithgow and Hulket after the long ball.
Holt's side in the final stage could have extended his lead, but McGregor stopped Jacobs from well-studded up before being sidelined by Lithgow.
Rangers called Glenn Middleton as an alternative, he made another late claim to the penalty as he got engaged to Jacobs, but Thompson did not let him succeed again.

Now a page from our “Sunday Morning” calendar: 136 years from today, 30 September, 1882 and beyond... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
For the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, Geyser invented a device that was later known as the geyser counter.
Geyser counter is a mainstay of science, it has become the mainstay of pop culture, plus, in 1950 a film on it became "Bells of Coronado", starring first-time scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is the geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
After turning on these earphones, you can certainly hear the effects of hidden atoms due to radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's definitely popping up right now!"
"Laughter" Geiger died in 1945, at the time he was 63 years old.
But, because of his invention, his name is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine can ‘see’ the poor cells of the immune system
The new cancer vaccine can “see” the immune system’s poor cells and eliminate them
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify bad cells during treatment
Through this method, the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory can be removed and replaced
After that, they can ‘see’ the common protein for many cancers and then remove it and reapply
A trial for the vaccine has shown promising results in different types of cancer patients.
A woman was vaccinated to see her poor cells present in the immune system, then it was observed that her ovarian cancer, which had been present for more than 18 months, had ended.
This method can remove and replace the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory, so that they can "see" the common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-infection the cells.
J Barzofsky, professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that this vaccine is very promising.”
Prof Barzofsky said that HER2 "progresses many types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
Removing the immune cells of patients and "guideing" them to detect cancerous cells is beneficial in the treatment of a kind of leukemia.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West on MAGA Hat condemned Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't go well
After Kanye West's finest performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that he would form his government in 2020 too, he condemned it in the studio during Saturday night live.
Following the performance of his third song of the night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Cap, he denounced the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So, I talk to white people several times and they say: "What's the reason for you to like Trump, they're racist?"
Yet, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago.”
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's Skit, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's case, it is already known that the Senate Judiciary Committee is already investigating the sexual harassment claims made to him by Christine Blaise Ford.
However, nothing like that was shown, the footage of West's condemnation was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It was not revealed whether Rock was trying to make the West laugh with the postings due to the post.
Along with this, West complained to the audience that he was threatened with going to the backstage with his headwear.
"They threatened me with backstage.
"""You don't go there wearing that hat."
They threatened me!
"I'm also stuck in the wrong place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said: “Do you want to see that wrong place?” At the same time, he said “They’ll make plays for my Superman Cape, because it means you can’t tell me what to do with me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Love it."
In his comments he referred to the audience at least twice and the SNL artist felt embarrassed, in a separate report one person told the publication: “The whole studio was completely silent.”
West was called in because of the delay in singer Ariana Grande's arrival, a few days before Ariana Grande's old boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died.
West surprised many viewers by giving performances on the song I Love It, she was dressed like Periyar Bottle.
West again met Candes Turner, head of Conservative Group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous people: Thanks for raising the voice for the public.”
But, the talk show's host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West just "is what she told and that's absolutely amazing."
“But, I didn’t choose anyone who benefits (by buying my music or clothes or by supporting my “art”) who is, in my opinion, promoting the wrong idea for my community or misquoting my community.
He is free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Before the show, rapper tweeted on Twitter that he had changed his name, as well as, saying that he was just "formally going to be known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, but earlier Diddy and Puffi had done the same, whose old names were Puff Diddy and P. Diddy respectively.
With him the rapper, Snoop Dogg's old name was Snoop Lion and the late famous Prince of Music also changed his name to the symbol and the artist was already known as the Prince.

The allegations will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star kit Herrington questions toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as John Snow in HBO's Violet Medium Fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But, the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of Macho Hero, saying that watching such roles on the screen often inspires many young boys and feels it is necessary to do such a difficult job to get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt explained that he was feeling "something went wrong" and asked how to overcome the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Recently, Kite married her 31-year-old co-star Rose Leslie of Game of Thrones, she believes she feels "very strongly" in talking about the problem.
"Privately, I feel strongly that right now - are we doing something wrong about masculinity?"""
‘Are we teaching men that when they’re growing up, they’ll have to deal with the problems they’re seeing on screen?’
Kite feels that television might be partly responsible for the toxic masculinity, thanks to its much more male lead character.
He said, “What is it and what is it taught?”
From what is taught on TV and on the street, young boys begin to believe that they should do certain things to be a man?
In my opinion, this has become one of the biggest questions of our time - how can we change that?
Because, of course, there is something wrong with the ideas of young men.
In an interview, he also admitted that when the series of Game of Thrones comes back at the end of next summer, he will not participate in any prequels or sequels of it, at the same time, he also said that he has carried out a number of programs with 'war fields and horses riding'.
From November, Kit will be working on Sam Shepard's new series of True West, the story of a film producer whose brother is a robber.
Recently, the actor revealed that the best thing he got from Game of Thrones is to meet his wife Rose.
“Through this show, I got my life partner, so I believe this show has given me my future family and my life has moved from here.”
Rose plays the role of Yagritt, who is the girlfriend of John Snow, the kite in the Amy Award winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple got married with family consent in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, there has been a 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced that there has been an increase of 14% in people suffering from HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials said more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
Given the recent changes, most of the new cases are attributed to sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to an infected blood infection.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials said the number of people suffering from HIV had almost gone to zero.
However, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection from sex caused by China's LGBT community is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but it is reported that the LGBT community has a lot of discrimination against people.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Due to many infections of the disease, these relationships have insufficient protection against sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, for which every person has been promised that they will be provided access to HIV medicine.
Maxin Waters denied that his employees leaked GOP Senator's data, calling it a "dangerous lie" and "a way of conspiring."
U.S. Representative Maxin Waters called the allegations unfortunate on Saturday, saying one of his employees had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. Senators on the Lombard's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the claims were being investigated by the pundits and website of the "Ultra-Right Wing."
Waters tweeted, “False, lies, and much more disgusting.”
The information contained addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham and two Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orin Hatch.
The information was seen online on Thursday, which was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, when the Senate panel was hearing allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Questions were being raised about the leak of some information from three senators.
Hill says the address tricks from conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState that identify the source of the person posting were reported to be linked to the Waters office and the information was released by an employee of Waters.
"This allegation is completely baseless, false and absolutely false," Waters said.
"No one of my employees - whose identity, personal information, and security are being put at risk because of these false and false allegations - was in any way responsible for the leak of this information."
This allegation is baseless, totally false and absolutely false.”
Waters soon posted online to clean up criticism, including former White House press secretary.
Fletcher wrote, "The reason for this rejection is anger."
"This shows that his temperament is not the same as that of a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something, they should not get angry and do so.
They should not be rebels.
They should not question the person who has made the allegations.
They should be calm and patient.”
It seemed that Fletcher was comparing Waters' answer with the condemnation of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, accusing Kavanaugh of being very angry by critics during the hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navaro also shared his thoughts on Twitter to defeat Waters in the midterm election.
He tweeted, “If it’s true, that’s a big deal.”
In his statement, Waters reported that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and rules enforcing units for these fraud claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators will be told about, and whether or not they will be held legally liable for all their actions that are very bad and dangerous to any and all of my employees," he said.
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - The act of espionage performed by Rowan Atkinson was not considered too strong
The importance of Brexit in any new film from a British perspective is still traditionally seen and it seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise that began with Johnny English in 2003 and was brought back in 2011 under the name of Johnny English Reborn.
Will we be self-absorbed on the subject as to how we are sure to talk on the nation's new export opportunity?
Johnny English, who has a pop-oriented and rubber-faced disability at any rate, has his license to recreate baseless legacies—which are more famous than anything else by his name—is a comprehensive comic creation for areas where non-English-speaking people live.
They are certainly the Daft Secret Agent who managed to show Mr Bean’s dash clusso a little bit despite his bizarre snag in the smoothie glamour and a dollop for the Chap that contributed a single note to the Chariot of the Fire Theme Tune at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is originally a traveler and an International Man of Secrets Atkinson whose role he played in Barclaycard TV commercials was forgotten, except for Wake's Chaos.
In this new JE outing, only one or two good scenes can be seen.
I liked Johnny English quite a lot, showing him going in a helicopter wearing a armored medieval suit and wrapping a rotor blade on his helmet.
Performing physical comedy on the screen is a kind of gift for Atkinson, but the laughter came very low and seemed to be half-finished, especially the "excellent" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible offer themselves with complete confidence as a component of comedy.
Laughter comes in such a way that comedy is not for adults but for children, and Johnny English’s strange misunderstandings are not at all tolerable for me and I like Bean more in Atkinson’s silent-film.
What has always been relevant right now is that there is a serious crisis in Great Britain.
The UK's most secret network of spies has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, the network had the identity of all Britain's working agents that could influence the agent's work - a tragic event for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the brilliant and very troubled Prime Minister, he is already grappling with many political and unpopular problems: this Quasi-Teresa-May character can play Emma Thompson well, but the script is not too strong to work on this script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every working detective has entered into an agreement, he will have to bring someone who has retired.
In this way it meant that Johnny English would have to fight by himself, now a school master at a posh institute, but an undercover operative has to work it out from the record on how it should be: it has some good humorous narrative, as well as, teaching English at a rock-type academy school by detectives.
English has been sent back to the emergency Whitehall for briefing and Ben Miller's re-play has been mixed up with his much-anticipated sidekick Buff.
Now that Bof is married, he is trying to become a submarine commander, his role is of Jolly-Hockey-Sticks in which Vicky Peperdin has not been able to settle.
Therefore, Batman and Robin get some very big mistakes in his Meghesty's Secret Service when they face Olga Cruelenko's beautiful femme burst Ophelia Bouletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of coming to the talk of the kerismatic tech billionaire who claims to have a solution to Britain’s computer crises: the sinister Jason Volta played the role of Jack Lacey.
English and Boggs begin their Odyssey of the Fersial High-Jinx: They set fire to a French restaurant while working as a waiter; they smuggle through Volta's expensive boat; and English completely activates chaos when it tries to use the interior of Volta's house as a virtual hedge.
The film has definitely been drawn everywhere for that last sequence, but still it is fine and entertaining, there are a lot of fun things for kids throughout the film.
A well-balanced middle class.
Also, as I saw in the second Johnny English films, in this film I did not understand whether or not Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that is really in line with his talent?
Labour has denied that it plans to work only four days a week for the British people, but will receive the money within five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering becoming a democratic plan that requires UK residents to work only four days a week - but the money will come in five days.
The party reportedly wants the owner of the company to give the workers part of the savings that will be saved through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution so that they can get an extra day off.
This will give the employee three days of leave a week - but they will still be able to get equal pay.
Sources said such an idea would be "expanded" with the party's economic agenda and it is a plan to benefit the country's workers.
Trade Union Congress is promoting a four-day shift a week so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party employee from The Sunday Times said: 'The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but it is expected to take a four-day work week, which is perfectly suited to the party's overall industrial strategy as well as the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers.
With the Green Party promising a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign, the Labour Party will not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, this desire is currently not fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesperson said: The four-day work week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he had intended to regain power in utility firms from "faceless directors" and "beneficials."
Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies may not get their full share back as the Labour government could "cut" on the basis of alleged wrongdoings.
He also confirmed plans to create an inclusive ownership fund to include employees on the company's boards and hand over 10 percent equity to private sector firms for employees who can receive annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Cavanna could change her mind
The FBI investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Cavanna delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings helped a Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pele asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility of something being discovered by the FBI that would inspire them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more clearly than his South Carolina ally.
"I think so," Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the hearing and talked to Judge Cavana.
After this happened, when the allegation came to light, I called them, asked, 'Did you do that?'
They were sure, firm, and clear."
However, Graham’s vote seemed to be a line of stone.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Cavanna and that would require an explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
And he could not verify what they had named him.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York, will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert featuring many highly influential stars, and equally impressive is its mission; ending the world’s poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Great Lawn of Central Park at the Global Citizen Festival will not only bring tens of thousands of people to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of the program to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Beginning in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival, an international advocacy group, is an extension of the Global Power Project, which actively hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To get free tickets to the program (except when you’re not ready to pay VIP tickets), those visiting the concert will have to complete “actions” in multiple tasks, such as emailing a world leader, making phone calls, or other meaningful ways to help them create awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has global citizens been in the remaining 12 years to achieve their goals?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free concert the right way to persuade people to call for action, or just another case of the so-called “clickivism” – people seem to be making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending tweets?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing efforts for various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than <0x24>37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least <0x24>10 billion of which are already distributed or money-raised.
The group estimates that the safe fund has so far had a direct impact on about 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers, committed to providing Rwanda with <0x24>35 million to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, the donor, the national government, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, said during a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with funding interventions.
One of the most frequently asked questions on your website is “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fall and fail.”
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jennell Mony is one of the few performers performing at this year's event in New York, hosted by Debra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. may use the Navy for "demonetisation" to disrupt Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner, revealed that Washington "may resort to the U.S. Navy if necessary" to curb Russian energy in the U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is because they want to broker energy, as they have done in the southern region of Europe, Eastern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability to with our Navy to ensure that sea routes remain open, and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran saying they are effectively uniform.
Referring to Russia as a "smooth pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels, he said, "Economic options in the case of Iran and Russia, more or less, are lifting and substitution of fuels."
The Trump administration, replacing Russia, is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, tried to convince Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump who, according to Trump, has made Berlin the "ban" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is ready to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons and an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the idea that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance was opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's industry-leading body, has asked the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kemf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I have a big problem when a big state interferes with our energy supply."
"Elizabeth Warren will consider ""seriously"" the matter of joining the presidential race in 2020, the Massachusetts senator said."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "seriously consider" the presidential race after the midterm election.
During the Town Hall in Hollyok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider taking part in the race.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and connect our broken government and that includes having a woman at the top," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider contesting the presidential election."
Warren, while assessing President Donald Trump during the town hall, said, "They are taking this county in the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren, Trump and their Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanna have been vocal in the criticism.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “Of course we need to get the FBI checked before voting.”
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents don't think they should contest the 2020 election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Poll, 18% of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said the senator should not contest elections.
Thirty-two percent voted in favor of this election.
The survey showed greater support for former governor Deval Patrick's running, where 38 percent supported a possible run in the election and 48 percent opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names likely to contest by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Track Paulin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
He was arrested in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he told the audience, "I feel sorry for other families who feel the impact of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers come back."
Palin called his arrest an "elephant in the room" and said of his son and other retired soldiers, "They return with little change, they come back harshly, they return wondering if this honor is for him who has sacrificed his fellow soldiers and aircraft-drivers, and every other member of the army for the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasila Police Department, she was arrested Monday in Wassila, Alaska, and a woman was charged with domestic violence and possession of a weapon by drunken driving.
18 States, D.C. Supports the Challenge of New Refugee Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to shelter survivors or victims of domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and districts filed a jurisprudence-friendly summary on Friday in Washington to support a refugee who challenged the policy.
The plaintiff's full name has not been disclosed in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her violent gang member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Public prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, creating a large number of applicants for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 ruling by the immigrant appeals board that allowed unorganized immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Resin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "regards decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal statute requires that all asylum claims be judged based on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a restriction violates that principle," said Justice-Friend.
The attorney further argued in the abstract that the refusal policy from the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy by saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply essential labour."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give shelter to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
In its June 11 policy announcement, Seshans said, “For those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to their caste, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group, shelter is available.”
The asylum was never meant to reduce all problems - even all serious problems - whose people face every day around the world.
The number of people who died in the battle for survival has doubled.
For the survivors, the situation was extremely serious.
"It sounds extremely stressful," said 35-year-old mother Reisa Kusuma, consoled the child suffering from bukhar in the evacuation center of Tahas-Nahas Palu city.
"Every minute brings an ambulance to the bodies.
Clear water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, picking up submerged items, trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalised after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit.
Some injured people, including Dwi Haris, who were facing broken backs and shoulders, rest outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were being treated openly outside due to persistent strong earthquake tremors.
Tears poured into his eyes as he felt the violent earthquake tremors in his fifth-floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
"I think, I was buried in the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, as well as told that her family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. envoy accuses China of "threating" through "promotion ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper, referring to the reciprocal benefits of U.S.-China trade, a four-page ad, the Chinese ambassador accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to propagate.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday - after China accused him of trying to interfere in Congress elections on November 6 - referred to China Daily's paid supplement in Iowa's most-selling newspaper - the Des Moines Register, the charge China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections was a new phase in Washington's campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen them go through a period of imposing customs duties on each other’s imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory customs first in the trade war were designed to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Bransted, the US ambassador to China and a long-time Iowa governor, the key exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Brenstad expressed his opinion in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, saying that China is “now doubling the bullying by running publicity ads in our own independent press.”
"In its publicity, by giving advertisements paid in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is leveraging the U.S. cherished tradition of free speech and independent journalism," Bransted wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in a strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, on the side of the road in Beijing, here on Newsstand, you will find limited unsatisfactory voices and no right reflection of the inconsistent opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's worrisome economic curve line," he wrote.
He said that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the offer to publish his article on excuses", although he did not name the newspaper.
With the defeat of Cavanna, Republicans are isolateing women voters ahead of midterm elections, analysts warn
Since the top Republicans are backing and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavona, who faces a number of allegations of sexual harassment, the analyst has warned that they will see the reaction, especially from women, during the upcoming medieval elections.
Feelings around it are quite overwhelming, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move forward with the vote.
Those things can't come back," Grant Reihar, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reihar said he suspects that pressure in the last minute by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women can’t forget what happened yesterday – neither can they forget tomorrow nor November,” said Carine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser to the progressive group MoveOn, according to a Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee wanted to move ahead with Cavanna's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters in the Senate hallway shouted "November is coming!", Mick reported.
Stu Rothenberg, a non-political analyst, told the news site, "Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be removed from the chart."
"People are saying it's already overwhelming; it's true.
But it may be more, especially among female voters from suburbs and 18-to-29-year-old young voters who don’t vote often when the president doesn’t like it.”
Describing the allegations of sexual harassment levelled by Ford against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had earlier said that there is a possibility of opposition if Republicans proceed with confirmation.
“This has become a tangled mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about putting the committee vote or the final vote or Cavanna on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they treated them," Gai Cecil, director of the U.S. Department of Defense, which helped Democrats in the election, drew attention to the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat divided in the matter of who to believe in in the testimony of Ford and Cavanna, most of whom appeared to favor Cavanna.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed in Ford's testimony definitively or potentially, while 35 percent said they believed in Kavona.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Cavanna lied probably or certainly during her testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations levelled by Ford as well as, at least another Faraday, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford took oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify that Cavanna had assaulted him intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee displayed his genitals when he joined a party while studying in Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of Technology Legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what information will be allowed to access.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about a personal online data store is that it completely depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring in resources, processes and appropriate skills by the company to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a community of on-staff developers, and volunteers coders contracted to work on the project.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said she and her team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to initiate a complete change, where all of their business models will end overnight."
"We are not asking them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in net neutrality debates.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard von: WW1 celebrates Victoria Cross Cleric
The only pastor of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during the First World War was celebrated 100 years in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard von won the award in the September 29, 1918 attack in Bellingue and Lehocourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and he never knew he had won the highest British military honour.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his ships at a parade held in Rashden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said it was "excellently symbolic" that this layer is being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led his battalion in Canal de Saint-Quentin "in the midst of a very dense fog, under heavy shelling and machine guns on the battlefield."
They later moved towards the firing line and, with "big valour," led the military-line before taking over the field-gun alone and dashed three troops.
On October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended, a German sniper was killed.
The 72-year-old Michael Vaughan said his grandfather’s accomplishments were “some that I know can never be equated with, but those we dislike.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vaughan, also performed the garland after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he was "feeling very honoured to play a role in the parade" and said "the valour of a real hero is being demonstrated with the support being given by many."
MMA fans kept waking up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got the Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the stunning Belator 206, but were deprived of watching the main event.
San Jose's bill had 13 contestants, including six on the main card and was shown live all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gergard Moosasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the U.K. were stunned by the change to the Peppa Pig of coverage.
Some were particularly disappointed after waking up in the morning to face the competition.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Belator’s senior vice president Dave Schwartz said, “This material was not suitable for 6 a.m. as per government regulation, so they had to switch to children’s programming.”
"""Pappa the Pig, yes."
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said they are going to work on their scheduling to include UK audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we'll probably find a solution," Coker said.
"But then there will be six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday their time."
But we are working on it.
Trust me, when this change happened, a lot of text was moving and not all of them were favorable.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mess.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I can assure you this won’t happen next time.
We'll limit it to five matches instead of six - like we usually do - and when we tried to deliver something more for fans, it just went a little too much.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Deli felt 'inadequate' in terms of sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daily says he was overwhelmed by a sense of inferiority towards everyone because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daily said she didn’t realize until she reached secondary school that “everyone is like me.”
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Lavern, she said she talks about gay rights to give others "hope."
She also said that she was less concerned about winning the Olympics when she became a father.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Karsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
On appearing as a socio-democratic figure at Lavern's first event, Daly said she was feeling "less" in herself than everyone else because " preferring boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
She said: “Even today, those feelings of feeling inferior to others, and feeling different, are the real things that have given me the strength and strength to be able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was also “chasing,” he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when he finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
She said she spoke openly because she felt lucky to be able to live freely without any trouble and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - was "surprised" when she fell in love.
Daly married an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but she said age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so many experiences at such a young age" - she went to her first Olympics at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was difficult to find an older man who had undergone a similar experience at such a young age.
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daly said her "complete approach" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all linked to 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are many things more than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son's name is similar to his father Robert, who died in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 40.
Daly said her father did not admit that he was going to die and the last thing he wanted to know was whether he had London 2012 tickets - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
She said, “I couldn’t tell them that you wouldn’t sit in the front row, Dad.”
He said, “When they were not able to breathe, I held their hands and held them until their breaths stopped and they were dead, so I thought they were invincible.”
The following year Daly participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"All I knew was that this is what I had dreamed of all my life - diving in front of the indigenous crowd at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling than that," she said.
It also inspired his favorite first song - Pride By Heather Small - which resonated with him during the Olympic preparations and which still makes his thighs stand.
The Desert Island Disc will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mikelson out of Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set the record on Sunday when they play their 47th Ryder Cup match, but they will have to change their form to protect it from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Playing at the biennial event for the record for the 12th time, Mikkelson was dropped from the game by captain Jim Furick for Saturday's Foreballs and Forsoms.
Instead of becoming the center of attraction, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day working among cheerleaders and hoping to improve the weaknesses of his playing way.
The 48-year-old player who never drives directly even at the peak of his career has not been the ideal fit for the Tight Le Golf National Course, where those who have not been active for a long time are regularly punished with wrong shots.
And while the course is not so easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has played together with Ruki Tommy Fleetwood to win all his four matches this week.
If the American players, who start four points down in 12 singles matches, start strong, Mikkelson's match can prove to be very important.
Furrick confided in his man, not that he could say anything else.
"They fully understood their role, patted my back and surrounded me in their arms and said they'll be ready tomorrow," Furic said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is the Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine playing his two matches.
I had more imagination, but it worked the way we thought we had to move on.
He wants to get out there just like everyone else."
Mikkelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most-played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This Ryder Cup could mark the end of a career that has never touched the heights of their personal record.
Mikkelson has found 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, though Furic said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's adventurous, he likes to make fun of people, and his presence in the team room is special," she explained.
"I think the young players also enjoyed going to him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big edge could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from his experience that a very large lead in the final-day singles of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dan made his first appearance in a 1997 match in Valderama, where a side under the captaincy of Siv Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory, with the lowest margin, just reached the finish line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderama, we just won," said Bourne after watching the 2018 class from Friday 5-3 and a 10-6 lead in Le Golf National yesterday.
So history will show me and all the people in that team that it is not over.
You will pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It doesn't end until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy and that's where the focus is to keep going.
I have always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the greatest players in the world - stand on the other side.”
Björn went on to explain how his players performed on the tough golf course: "In this I will never get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
The personal performances will come forward tomorrow, and that’s a different thing.
It’s great to go there with a partner when everything’s going well, but when you get out there personally, your potential as a golfer is fully tested.
This is the message that you need to convey to the players to showcase your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and he has to give his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite standing Jim Furrick would have been looking for a better performance personally for his players who he did as a partner, the exceptions were Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Before facing defeats due to Europe’s “miracles in Medina” showing up, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Furick himself has been at both ends of those big last days’ repercussions.”
"I remember every one of his flaws," he said in response to a question about how Ben Cranshaw took over his players on the last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches yesterday, but you'll want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this momentum is one-sided, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We set our line-up according to ourselves and incorporated people in the way we felt, you know, we're trying to do something more miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead a counter-attack with Rory McLarero in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rhym, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Potter are the top half of the other European order.
"I had formed a group of them in this order because I think it covers all," Björn said of his solo selections.
Germany's new warship has been postponed again.
New warships of the German Navy should have been commissioned to replace the warships of the time-influenced Cold War-era in 2014, but due to faulty systems and rapidly rising costs, this will not happen until at least next year, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Reinland-Pultz", which is the flagship ship of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg-class warships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling issues after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships were ordered back by the Navy in 2007 to be brought in as replacements for the time-effective Bremen-class warships.
It is understood that they will feature an array of powerful artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth techniques such as low radar, infrared and acoustic division.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from indigenous ports for up to two years.
However, continued delays mean that state-of-the-art warships - which could allow Germany to have a power project abroad - would be time-consuming until the period of entry into service, Die Zein commented.
The Durdent F125 warships made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned the Blohm and Was Shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship’s manufacturer after delivery to a ship.
Very few people were aware of the reasons for the withdrawal, but the German media cited several important “software and hardware defects” that would render the warship useless when deployed on a war mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - only half of the manpower of the old Bremen class warships.
In addition, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically more weighted which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Reinland-Pultz" is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including crew training - is becoming an issue.
It is said that it has reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6 billion) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problem of new warships becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings is tightening Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "depleting three-lane-capable ships."
The issue has become serious over time as old ships were removed from use, but no replacement ships were made available, the official said.
He said none of the Baden-Württemberg-class warships were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
New research being carried out in an estate in the Scottish Highlands is aimed at revealing how bats use natural landscapes in their hunt for food.
It is expected that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of flying unique mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust of Scotland, will follow normal and soprano pipestrels as well as brown long ears and dobenton bats settled in Weston Ross' Inverway Garden.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the property to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings shows the frequency of bat calls and what species are doing.
Then a map and report of the natural habitat will be prepared for depiction on a detailed landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of natural habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of natural-hospital management tasks such as how to build grasslands and how to maintain woodlands well for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly in the last century
They are threatened by construction and development works, which affect the bases of birds and damage the natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, as some chemical treatments of flypaper and construction materials, as well as attacks by pets can also be dangerous.
The bees aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey because of their hunting habits.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to indicate faults and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists, who regularly survey, inspect the bases of birds and sometimes save them.
The organization has set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the three estates of Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the best place for him.
"We have a good area for bats here in Trive," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and all good natural habitats.
But there’s a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and in other assets will help us understand what they need to shine on.”
They stress the importance of checking bats before they can be maintained within the estates because it is possible that unintentionally destroying 400 females and infants from the destruction of the maternity base, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass them or destroy their bases.
The Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Ferrell, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species we still don’t know how their population is growing.”
Ronaldo dismissed rape claims while lawyers sued the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape claims against him "false news" and said people want to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer is due to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
Portugal and Juventus are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Dere Spiegel reported on Friday that she allegedly paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video after reporting claims, the 33-year-old Ronaldo described the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
"What he said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular by my name, but it’s part of their work.
"I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyer, Der Spiegel, is preparing to prosecute for the charges he has called "suspicious invalid reporting in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the players would "ask for compensation for moral damage in the amount in line with the severity of the breach, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of Pams Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to papers filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her.
Meyerga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he is "99 percent" a "good person" whose "one percent" has disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but there was mutual consent for it.
Meyerga also claims that she had gone to the police and had also taken photos of her injuries to a hospital, but later agreed to an agreement outside the court as she felt "scared of retaliation" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to end the deal as her harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal with Italian giant Juve this summer.
Brexit: UK to lose producer 'will always regret'
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the U.K. would "forever regret" if he lost his title as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said Toyota had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernstone near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, border delays could have an impact on jobs.
The Bernstone plant - which makes Toyota's Orris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota at Burnstone.
Other UK car makers have expressed apprehension about leaving the EU without agreeing on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant for a month after Brexit in Oxford.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to the risk of supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts of Made-to-Order cars coming from suppliers in both the UK and the EU, every 37 minutes.
If the U.K. leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruptions at the border, according to industry that could lead to delays and shortages of spares.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's checkers plan for future relations with the European Union was "clearly calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
“We need a deal. We want a great deal that, in my view, not only can we enjoy success in the present, but also what is needed to achieve this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“There’s been evidence from not only Toyota but from other manufacturers that we should be able to fully continue to do this which has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually the jobs would go away.
Peter Sauvalieris, who has worked in Burnston for 24 years and is the convener of the Unite Union at the plant, said his members are highly concerned: “In my experience once these jobs are gone, they never come back later in the bad.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again.
The White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for "another week later" as the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavna continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, the relationship between Trump assistant and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will remove the deputy attorney general, and that threatens Mueller's independence, the news has warmed Washington's rumored market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wiring to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, they went to the White House amid reports that they are about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" the removal of Rosenstein but then delayed the meeting to avoid confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing, in which both Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, a woman accused of sexual misconduct, had testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of claims against Cavanna, delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “The date for this has not been set, it could happen this week, I can see that the view of all other cases going on with the Supreme Court can be pushed one more week ahead.”
But we will see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists have claimed that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefing wasn’t due to TV reporters’ unhappiness with “disappointment,” though he said: “I don’t disagree with the fact that they’re gorgeous.”
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
“The president does more Q&A sessions than any other president,” she said, not citing the evidence, saying: “We have seen those numbers.”
Brewing will still be there, Sanders said, but "If the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me."
We try very hard to do that and you have seen us do so a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United States he is going to replace the press talk.”
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or at a press conference with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President demonstrated his unwavering and often unique presence in front of reporters, perhaps demonstrating why.
Health Secretary NHS writes to EU workers in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU employees working in the NHS of Scotland with the intention of expressing gratitude to the country and wishing them to stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
The Scottish government is committed to meeting the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens already working in its degraded public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “In the summer, mutual talks between the UK and the EU continue, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also pushing its preparations for a potential no-deal scenario.
I know it would have been a time of great uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I now wanted to reiterate how much I value each staff member’s contribution, regardless of his nationality.
The EU, and beyond, brings with it peers, valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here.”
Cristian Abercrombie's emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury, Tennessee Mike Organ said.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury occurred just a short time before halftime.
"He came to the shore and just fell there," Reid said.
Trainers and medical personnel put him on stretcher and oxygenated Abercrombie on the sideline before taking him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Aberdromby had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said "no details are available on the type/limit of the injury so far" and that the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in its first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He scored a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making his season a total of 18 tackles.
High stamp duty will be charged from foreign buyers when buying property in the UK
When foreign buyers buy property in the UK, they will be charged high stamp duty, which will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralise the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury hopes it will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Preparations are being made to charge higher stamp duty rates on buying property in the UK from foreign buyers - the additional cash that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign attracting young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high earners.
The stamp duty hike will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional funds that will boost the government's campaign to deal with the goldsmiths in odd circumstances.
surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes two homes and rental purchases launched two years ago, can be a maximum of 3%.
The Treasury is expected to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly-built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, making it difficult for first-time buyers to foot on the staircase.
Many of the country's wealthy regions - especially in the capital - have become "bhutah cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut with the intention of helping more young people build their first home.
He accused large construction firms of grabbing lands but not using them to raise property prices, and urged Mrs May to leave quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing vacuum".
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the end of rent control and "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give more powers to the councils for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our disintegrated housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it is not correct that it is as easy for individuals not living in the UK as for foreign-based companies as it is for hardworking British residents to buy a home.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has become very distant, and the fury of gold in odd circumstances is extremely real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
Scott, 42, is repeating the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which is currently ranked third in League One, and which is three points away from the top.
They moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren for the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I got the B cap and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father since childhood, and it's always been something that pulls me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in club management.”
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gauss Poett, and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alloa athletic boss says he did not feel nervous about following established names at such a large club that had previously rejected the initiative of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me can be gauged from whether I can return this club to the Premier League."
Due to the structure and features of this club, it undoubtedly comes in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get there, but I’ll probably see myself succeeding here if I can get the club there.”
After spending 15 months in Dumbberton’s assistant boss and in Hart’s coaching staff, Ross’ management career has just been three years.
He then helped Eloa recover from the third tier defeat, and replaced St. Mirren with the defeat of the championship title winners in the next season.
And Ross says they feel more comfortable now than they did during their careers in Clyde, Hartpalpool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
When asked about Aloa's takeover, he said, "This was probably the real intersection."
"I really believed that management was a more perfect fit for me than playing.
It sounds strange because I did the right thing, earned the right amount of money from it, and enjoyed some reasonably highs.
But playing can be difficult.
On a weekly basis, you have to get a lot of things.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but everything seems fine in terms of management.
I always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it, it makes me feel the most comfortable in my adult life.”

The right time for a pint is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday, the survey found
The summer heat has boosted Britain's struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on the restaurant chain.
The pub and bar group saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurant fluctuations were down 4.8 percent, data showed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, which compiles statistics, said: “Strong sunshine and July mean similar patterns followed in the month of June last year when pubs were up 2.8 percent, except that restaurants faced even more difficulties.”
Restaurant trade fell 1.8 per cent in June and further worsened in July.
Wine-selling pubs and bars performed the strongest with more likes than restaurants.
Food-powered pubs also suffered damage in the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
Sales of all pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food consumption declined by three per cent.
Paul Newman, Leisure and Hospitality Analyst RSM, said: “These results have continued the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or sports events becomes the biggest factor for sales in the outdoor market.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, although a year-on-year drop of 4.8 percent in sales, especially due to ongoing cost pressure, would be painful.
The long summer weather could not have been the time and bad time of the food-material operators and time will tell if the higher moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide a much-needed relief.”
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings in July, was 2.7 percent, reflecting a slower pace in the brand roll-out.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey shows that one in five children - some under the age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in "fake insta" pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show parents
One in five children - some under the age of 11 - are creating social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, “fake Insta” accounts grew rapidly – a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clean “main” account to show parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found that a teenager in it was urging others to "rape me."
Research from independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which were accepted to hold private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s very disturbing that a lot of teens are tempted to make online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Ilyad Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Ilyad Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for sports mentors to benefit from his extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
“Ilead has a lot of respect for the Scottish, UK and the world athletics community and we are sure that bringing athletics to the board in Scotland will benefit a lot,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: “I’m looking forward to working as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland.”
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, Americans who won the 200m and 400m race at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and now who are regular BBC pundits were unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I am going to be okay or not and to what extent I can be right.
It was terrible work, but learned to recover completely, walk again and practice agility today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Comparison of mothers’ cows by breast pump advertising created differences in the opinion of online people
A breast pump company divided online opinion by an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product called "the world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a new funny music video-inspired ad, giving new pump mothers the freedom to express themselves.
In the grassy barn of cows, four real mothers dance on a song that contains some of the following words: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, these are not the churns, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Feeding Dam Babys, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Milking My Ladies.”
Whatever the case, the advertisement, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 observations and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed responses from audiences, with many saying it represents the "fearfulness" of the dairy industry in a light-hearted way.
"Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Just as we need to give birth to them to become pregnant and produce milk, except that they are stolen from them within a few days after giving birth to their babies," one wrote.
Elvie breast pump fits consciously within the nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “Of course it’s sad for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their children?”
Someone else added: “How irrelevant is advertising.”
Others defended the ad, one of which a woman said she found the ad's song "amusing."
"I think that's a very good idea.
I would have had it if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping gives me the experience of being a cow at all.
This advertisement is a bit strange, but I saw it the same way it is.
One wrote that it's a great product."
The second commented: “It’s a fun ad for mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and feel like “sing”.
It is not a promotion or decisive advertisement for the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they continued to dance by pumping carefully in their bras.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump the breast say they feel like they are a cow.
However, the Elvi pump remains well hidden, has no wire or tube and directly carefully fits into a nursing bra, gives women the freedom to move around without pumping, catch their children and even go out.
ECD in Ana Balerin, Partner and Mother commented: "Elevating pumps are a revolutionary product, entitled to a blasting and spectacular launch.
By underlining the parallel between them, telling about the cows of women and dairy, we want to bring the breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, showcasing a sense of freedom in an entertaining and related way that will bring new pumps.
This is not the first time that the Elvis pump has been in the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product, designer Marta Jacubosky, appeared to be catwalking for the catwalk.
Hundreds of migrant children sneak into a tent camp on the Texas border
The caught migrant children were spied on, even when there was no relative change in the monthly border crossings, to some extent because the harsh curvature and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to appoint children with sponsors.
Traditionally, the maximum sponsors themselves had hired migrants without a document and were afraid to further jeopardize their own ability to live in the country by claiming any child.
The threat escalated in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult or older members of the household would have to give their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigrant authorities.
Last week, a senior official of Matthew Albans, Immigration and Customs Enforcement submitted evidence to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsoring unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested already have no criminal record.
"Approximately 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or are members of the sponsor's household live illegally in the country and the maximum of them are criminals."
That's why we continue to search for those individuals," Mr. Albans said.
Seeking to quickly prepare the children, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which the children were required to appear in court within one month of being held instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the employees who took refuge.
Many people appear through video conference calls rather than being personally present to present their case for legal position before an immigrant judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for release are immediately evicted.
The longer the children remain imprisoned, the more likely they are to remain Bachen or depressed, which can be quantified in violent impulses or attempts to escape, according to the system report in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said that those cases are taken to a higher facility like Tornillo, where the indication that the child is struggling is ignored because of their size.
At the same time, he said that without giving children enough time to be emotionally ready or without saying goodbye to friends, taking them to the tent city would further aggravate the shock with which they are already struggling.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mauleem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even when the country was now the eighth year of war.
Maulam, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said foreign military forces illegally live on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly."
"They should immediately and unconditionally withdraw from the battlefield," he told the assembly.
Maulam stressed that "the war is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million people have been uprooted from their homes.
He said the Damascus would continue to fight this “alternative war” until both of us clear all terrorist groups and all of the Syrian territories of “the presence of a foreigner.”
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly training and advising both Khurshid and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on land in the country destroyed by the war.
On the case of refugees, Maulam said the conditions were right for them to return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading fear of abuse," which prompted the refugees to stay away.
“We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to simplify this withdrawal.”
"They were politicizing a completely humane matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not receive any aid for reconstruction unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United States politicians say, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the stronghold of Idlib's last major uprising creates an opportunity to put further pressure on political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement avoided a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province where three million people lived.
However, Maulam said the agreement had a "clear timeline" and hoped that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from al-Qaida linked to the Nusra Front, "to be eliminated."
U.S. Representative Stephane Di Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee with government and opposition members to prepare a post-war constitution to fix Syria and the election route.
Maulam placed certain conditions in the committee for the involvement of the Syrian government, stating that the work of the panel should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and to warn against interference.
Why Trump will win in the second term
With that logic, Mr. Trump will win the election again in 2020, unless many liberal or elites are expecting any impropriety and scams to end his term ahead of time.
"This will be the most dramatic finish of the national term ever!"
So far, no fatigue was seen in the audience.
Since 2014, the prime-time rating on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of over 1.7 million prime-time viewers over the past four years, and MSNBC's "The Racial Mado Show" ranked the highest in cable ratings by achieving 3.5 million viewers with major news airing at night.
An ABC drama about Cabinet Secretary "Designated Survivor" who becomes president after the destruction of the U.S. Senate building in an invasion, its director Neil Bear said that "it is a fire that people are attracted to because it is not something we understand."

The value of entertainment was in disarray.
Of course, beyond TV and anything else, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe V. Wade, the future of immigrant families, and the health of the global economy.
Only specialised audiences could afford to ignore it.
And yet, it’s beyond being an aware citizen, when you find yourself looking at the six-hour debate of a panel of experts, using the root cause of Woodward’s “deep background” for his book “Fire”, Paul Manafort’s <0x24>15,000 bomber jacket (“A thick cloth with hair” by the Washington Post) and Storm.
I'll never see Super Mario like that again.

In the run-up to the election house, there was a flood of external funds.
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania was flooded with money or cash in the 17th, thanks to which two office-bearers came forward for the same seat race.
Which recently opened the front for the Democrat Rape Conor Lamb of the suburban Pittsburgh district - who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamps were also involved in a second term race, Republican Kathy Rothfoss, who currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which intersects with the new 17th.
Following the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in January in a case of unconstitutional forgery in favour of the Republicans by the old districts, the map or maps were recreated.
In the new 17th race, the empty-handed battle between the major finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) touched the campaign's economy.
Lamb's name became quite popular in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election of the 18th Congress District of Pennsylvania.
For this reason, the seat was occupied by the Republicans for nearly a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits instigated the democrats a little more.
U.S. to punish El Salvador for supporting China, then retreat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing due to resistance by Washington.
Mr. Trump held an enthusiastic meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the Trump organization's management team fired the partners.
Earlier this month, Department Spokesperson Haider Nort said in a statement that on the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore", state department officials decided to recall the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only El Salvador was penalized, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including Narcotics Control, Development, and Financial Aid.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When internal meetings or meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to pursue that aggregation or mass similar to last year, which was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from leaving the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to go ahead and end effectively considering any penalties or penalties for El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now set to address the conference, which has now been scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of importing administrative places at the conference.
And the three Americans returned from Washington quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or penalties.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the debates or debates described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration as well as speaking on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next case may be the report of the Special Council Robert Mueller on possible resistance to Mr. Trump's justice, of which there is now sufficient evidence in the public record.
At the same time, Mr Mueller's report changes the direction of his investigation if Mr Trump's campaign colludes with Russia to invade our elections.
When Congress joins hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable in that body when they prepare themselves to go before voters again and perhaps in front of a jury of their colleagues.
That is, a lot if or if and I do not mean to indicate or suggest that Mr. Trump's collapse is not inevitable, nor the collapse of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have options to choose on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed to the West and Czechoslovakia supported him in Munich.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to stop the massacre of so many years.
The functioning of historical focal points around such divisive points and the unmitigated march of democracy are accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these divisive points.
If Mr. Trump’s Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosentine, the person who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller’s investigation, is fired from the job, what will we do?
Rosentine has been in this confusion ever since this paper reported it last year, suggesting secretly keeping the president's record and considering his disqualification for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said that The Times' account is not accurate.
"If recently requested Brett Kavanaugh's F.B.I. investigation is not complete or fair - or if he remains steadfast in the Supreme Court despite the authentic allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, how will we react?"
And beyond that, will we vote for the Congress in the medium term, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail those investigations, democracy will last for a long winter.
But I think we won't fail because of the lessons I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who had previously occupied my ambassador home as well.

Graham Doran's Rangers are still optimistic after the intense Vienna encounter
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, winning the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the European League.
Knee injury prevents midfielder Graham Turan from appearing for the first time in a session of up to 2-2 with Villareal, but he believes rangers can use that result as a springboard for big things.
"It was a good thing for us because the villas were good," the 31-year-old said.
"We went ahead in the game with the belief that we can achieve something and reach a conclusion.
Maybe we can get it in the end, but overall, the draw will likely be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we got better in the second period.
Moving towards Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they get good results with the crowd or crowd behind us in their last game, I'm sure we'll play well and get positive results.
Whatever happened to my injuries and the changes made to the club itself last year was definitely difficult but now there is a good experience in this place.
The squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they've got good training.
Hopefully now we can leave our last session behind and move on and be successful.”

Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking about it to their family members.
More than half of the individuals across the country said they were talking to their partner about the long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but they don't take any steps to negotiate," said Holly Cinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You won’t be able to prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Discuss with your advisor and your family where and how to get care, as that option can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also advise you on ways to pay those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, to help pay these expenses or to insure your own health, as long as you have money.
Present your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.
Get a health-care proxy, so you hire a trusted person to look after your medical care and make sure that if you are unable to communicate or interact, the professionals follow your wishes.
Also, consider the attorney's right to inspect your finances.
You will select a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are taken to the hospital.
So will you be able to answer questions related to their medications and allergies?
Write that information in a written plan so that you are ready.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise further, officials said.
When the communication was off, the rescue officers were unable to get any information from Dongla Regency, the northern region of Palu, which is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated in the catastrophe.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongula, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, located on the shores of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donovan is a regency on the beach northwest of Sulawesi Island, spread over an area of more than 300 kilometers (180 miles).
Below the administrative province there is an estimated population of 299 in the Regency, which was 200 in 2017.
The mainstay of the economy of the central Sulawesi province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Dongla.
Nickel mining in the province is also very important, but it is concentrated in Moravali on the opposite coasts of the maximum Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, tsunamis in Palu and Dongula have struck several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western dock, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire from seismic point of view and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's AK province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, half of whom were in AK.
2005: A series of intense earthquakes also struck the western coasts of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A tsunami of 6.8 magnitude occurred in Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami, which struck the south coast and killed about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake near the city of Padang hit the region, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the island of Mentawai on the coast of Sumatra hit the region, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people in a tsunami that hit an area of up to 10 meters.
2016: A splashed water earthquake in AK strikes the Pedi Jaya Regency, causing destruction and stampede as it reminded people of the destruction or destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There were no tsunamis this time, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings or buildings.
2018: Intense earthquakes devastated Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern direction of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and rendered thousands of tourists helpless for some time.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Pelin, the eldest son of former Alaska ruler and deputy presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assaulting.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for tampering with reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released by the state of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she used to call him.
According to the KTUU report, Pelin was sent back to the mut-su pretrial facility and was also fined a <0x24>500 unsecured bond.
The network reported that he appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked for a plea.
Pelin faced three A-class criminals, where he could be fined up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He is also charged with a one-day prison sentence and a <0x24>2,000 fine for Class B offense.
This is not the first time that criminal cases have been registered against Pelin.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father Todd Pelin.
His mother, Sarah Pelin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Experienced Persons of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and possessing a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Pelin was criticized by a group of experienced individuals in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was linked to PTSD stemming in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake activated the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
In the coming days, along with the rise in mortality, electricity and communication networks were also not functioning.
The earthquake struck central Sulawesi, which is the northeastern region of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact were circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, thousands of people gathered in the city of Palu for the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors are seeking rare death penalty for NYC attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding a rare death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack on New York City that killed eight people -- a rare sentence awarded to the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Cypov, 30, reportedly uses a home depot rental truck to invade pedestrians and cyclists down the western direction highway in Manhattan in October, cutting down pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors have to prove that Cypov has "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" physically injured them, according to information on intent to demand the death penalty imposed in New York's southern district.
Both of these countries potentially give death penalty according to the court document.
A week after the invasion, a federal grand jury hit Cypov with Chanta for 22 charges, including eight counts of murder to assist in racketeering, which are specifically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime and in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the invasion required "sufficient planning and prior deliberations", explaining the manner in which Cypov carried out it in a "hate, cruel and evil" manner.
"SAFULU HABIBULUVIC SYPOV has injured and damaged the friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clives Annor DeCatt, Darren Drake, Ariel Elirz, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alosandro Paganko," the report said.
Five of the victims were tourists, who were from Argentina.
The trial on the last death penalty case in the southern district of New York has been going on for a decade.
Mulzim Khalid Brain was found guilty of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were last sentenced to death in the New York federal case, a married couple who were found guilty of plotting to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Joanne Rosenberg was sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Cypov, a local resident of Uzbekistan, had no glint or regrets for days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
Police said they told investigators that they liked what they did.
Cypov told officials that he was inspired to attack after watching videos of ISIS meeting with crime on his phone.
Police said they also requested the display of the ISIS flag in their hospital room.
He pleaded not to be guilty of the 22-counting offence himself.
David Patton, one of the federal public patrons representing Cypov, says he is "fairly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We think our decision to seek death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of being released will only defer the mental trauma of these events to include everyone," Patton said.
Cypov's defense team had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be tasked for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz vowed to "collect an army of people" during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The Eastern Yukip leader asked politicians to "understand the mahaul" from Euroscaptics - as Theresa May, one of her own MPs suggested she should negotiate with the European Union.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bonn told the march in Birmingham that if Mr. Faraz was Brexit secretary, Britain would have 'done out by now'.
But the challenges faced by Mrs May in resolving her extremely split rank have been underlined by pro-Rimen Tory to add a different opposition to Brexit in the city.
The premier is struggling to keep his checker's compromise plan on track during attacks from Brexiters, reminders, and the European Union.
The allies urged that she would try to reach an agreement with Brussels instead of backlash – and would force Euroscaptics and workers to choose between their packages and chaos.
Mr. Bone said that quitting means leaving the rally in Solihal, in which he wants to 'frank the checkers'.
She suggested that Mr. Faraz should be made a partner and be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brucelle.
"If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now," she said.
The MP or MP from Wellingborough said: ‘I will stand for Brexit but we need to get the checkers out.’
Setting its opposition to the EU, he said: 'We don't need to be subject to anyone to fight a world war.'
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bonn rejected all the suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their views and they want to stay is completely false.'
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkins was also quoted as saying in March: "I'm just saying this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The checker is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent among our party and our workers who actually surround the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please drop the checkers and start listening.”
In a focused message to Smt., she said: The Prime Minister maintains his jobs when he does not break his promise.
Mr. Faraaz said the rally leaders should be made 'feeling the mahaul' if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 Referendum.
"This is now a matter between us - people and our political classes," he said.
“They are trying to cheat Brexit and today we have come here to tell them that ‘we will not let you run away by doing so.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: “I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, understanding the atmosphere.
We are organizing the army of the people of this country who have given us victory in Brexit and who does not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the reminders march from Birmingham before a two-hour rally takes place in the center of the city.
A group of activists hinted at Tories against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
When the Labor Pierre Lord Adonis Conference opens, the party appears to have a conversation about security issues from the app.
"It's the people who tell us that they can have a fair IT system for Canada, a barrier-free border and border-free trade in Ireland and all technology.
"It's a full swing.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to adopt a "strict approach" on the president's operations
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "strictly monitor the president's operations" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the town hall in western Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Democratic or Democratic spoke about their future.
Warren GOP, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is in the race for re-election in the state's iconic Geoff DeHall November, a co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
They were speculated that they could replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holiok was Trump's 36th meeting with voters using the Town Hall format since he took office.
One of the attendees asked if he was going to join the presidential race.
Warren replied that now is the time for “women to go and fix our broken government and include women first.”
LSU was sentenced to death.
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, on Saturday announced that a suspect was arrested in the murder of LSU basketball player Wedde Sim on Friday.
The Betton Disease Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET news conference or conference.
He released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
The 20-year-old Sim was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Police chief Murphy G. Paul told 247 sports per day on Saturday that "he died of a gunshot wound to the head of Wade Sim".
Wade went on to defend his friend and was killed by Simpson.
On being asked by Simpson, he confessed to killing Wed Sim with a weapon there.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the police department of East Beton Disease Parish.
A 6-foot 6-foot junior, who grew up in Betton's disease, played 32 games with 10 starters last season in Sim and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes world title after team win over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtery Bottas deserved to play a big role in the team order race on Saturday, Louis Hamilton Mercedes.
From the pole, Bottas made a good start and ousted Hamilton as he made his place in the first two turns and invited Vatell to create a barrier to his team's drivers.
Vettel first went into the pits and left Hamilton in the traffic behind the pack, something that should be decisive.
Mercedes was a lap behind and came out of the back of Vettel but Hamilton trailed after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw Ferrari's driver reluctantly defends on the third corner leaving without any risk-free after a double-move.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh on reaching the end of the first lap by his 21st birthday.
He then proceeded to a large part of the race when he focused on changing his tires and quickly moved to the fourth place from Kim Raikonen.
He finally came in the Pits at the 44th lap but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, when Reconnan finished fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valtery did a great job the entire weekend and is a truly great gentleman.
The team did an excellent job by getting one or two, Hamilton said.
It was really a very bad feeling.
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Saturday lied to Senator Dean Feinstein at his request, noting he leaked a letter from Christine Blasey Ford alleging sexual abuse by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly address the statement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on the current situation in the Senate, saying that people are "disciples and bad and dishonest."
"A very good thing or thing that may have happened in the Senate in the last few days, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people," he said.
"When you look at the release and leak and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do it'."
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dean Feinstein, did you leak?
I remember her reply... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked."
Well, wait a minute.
"We didn't, we didn't, we didn't," he said, pointing to the senator.
Feinstein was sent back in July a letter detailing allegations made by Ford against Kavangua and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein declined to say it was leaked from the office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he said."
But the president didn't find his rejection justified, who commented at a Saturday night rally: "Let me tell you that it was really a very bad gesture.
He may not have done that, but I have hardly ever seen such a bad gesture before."
Continuing the defence of the Supreme Court candidate, the three women who have been accused of sexual misconduct, the President said the Democrats were using the allegations on their behalf.
"They are determined to withdraw power through any necessary means.
You see their meanness, dirt, and also that they don't care who they hurt or who they're running behind to get power or power or control," the intermediary reported to the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giant
Patrick Dewar scored two goals for Giant against Dundee
Dundee Stars on Saturday won a 5-3 return match in Dundee to compensate for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giant.
The Giants got two goal lead initially through attacks from Patrick Doyer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crawley brought home side level before the Giant's lead was reinstated.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Boschard equalled it for Dundee before securing victory by two goals by Lucas Lundwalt Nilsson.
This was Adam Keef's third Elite defeat of the season for the men who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
With Giants winning the last three games, it was the fourth meeting of the session on the sides.
Dwayne's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Candle McFoll, in which David Rutherford assisted Beauvilleer to double the lead in the subsequent four minutes.
In the busy opening period, Sullivan performed his home game back at 13:10 before Matt Marquis came to the equivalent of Coun<0xC3><0xA9>e at 15:16.
Doyer ensures that the Giants take the lead in the first break until he hits his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side is grouped again and Boshard once again brings them to the level period with a power play goal at 27:37.
Couni and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nelson lead Dundee for the first time in the second period of the match and ensured victory in his team's fifth halfway in the final period.
Giants, who had lost their last five games so far, are now due to play in their next match at Milton Kane on Friday.
The air traffic controller was killed in order to ensure that hundreds of people could escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero or hero since he was killed in ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people could safely land.
More than 800 people have been killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake that triggered a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The subsequent tremors in the area continued to be destroyed and many people were trapped under the rubble in the city of Palu.
But while his associates were fleeing to save his life, 21-year-old Antonios Gunwant Agung refused to leave his post on the busy busy schedule at Mutiara Sis al-Juffari Airport Palu Airport.
He was waiting there to make sure the Betic Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, landed safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower, when he thought it was going to fall.
He later died at the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johns Sertret, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpan in Kalimantan to take them from another city to a bigger hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost them before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken," he said.
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could reach thousands with the destruction of the country, with the undermining agency saying access to the dockla, siggy and botosh is limited.
"The mortality rate may still rise as many bodies may still be buried in remains or debris, or in many places that cannot be reached," said the agency's spokesman Sutpo Ngharho.
The six-metre-high waves ravaged Palu, which led to mass burial on Sunday.
Army and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Reesa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brought the bodies.
It is rare to get clean water.
Small markets were looted everywhere."
Jane Galfand, head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "Indonesia is running the race to help the Red Cross biologists, but we don't know what they'll get there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I'm asking you all to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation or evacuation."
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
The first earthquake in Indonesia earlier this year hit Lobonk, killing about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niagudini now reveals that a man has been missing since the Lagoon plane crash
The airline, which operates the plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Macedonia, now says a man is missing when it was last reported that 47 passengers and crew or crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niagudini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to trace the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to requests for over information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
When the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at the default island airport, local boats helped save other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all of them are now in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the manner in which the incident took place is unclear.
The airline and the US Navy said the two aircraft did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought the plane did not land on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jane said the plane had come down a lot.
"It's a very good thing," Jane said.
Jane said she and others were pulled out of deep water from the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the aircraft's staff were panicking and shouting and he received a minor injury on the head.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working around to improve the ghat also helped rescue people by using an airboat to bring people to shore in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the Aviation Security Network indicates that 111 people were killed in the crash of the PNG-registered airline in the last two decades but none were involved in the Air Niagudini.
The analyst told the time of the night when the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution on Saturday restored its case to re-suit a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rolett presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation analysis.
She told the jury how she may have used cell phone records to bring together the activities of 29-year-old Mulzim Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
Rolett said he obtained location data from several cellphones, which shows that the dead were with Talis Chambers in the evening, denying his previous claims, The Clarion-Lazer reported.
When the data shows that when he said he was with his friend Michel Sanford, his cell phone was with Chambers at the time, police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented evidence that he was not in the city on that day.
When asked if Talys was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because his truck was in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Talis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cellphone records show that they knew each other for a week.
Rolett said that shortly after Chamber's death, Talis has removed all text or messages, calls or contact information from his phone.
Hale said, "He wiped her out of his life."
The defense is set to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was expected to approach the jury for hearing the case on that day.
High Breed: What is conscious or conscious hip hop?
Hip Hop's trio wants to change the negative view of the genre by filling up positive messages in their music.
High Breed from Bristol claimed that hip-hop has stuck to its roots to deal with political messages and social issues.
They wanted to get away from their roots and re-awaken the popular hip-hop.
Artists like Fuges and Common saw a latest resurgence in the UK through artists like Alaka and Loki.
The second black man?!
NY Nanny sues couple after firing after "satellite" text
A New York Nanny sues a couple for biased targeting after a mother complains that she is a "second black person", making misleading texts.
Couples reject that they are racists, prosecuting for "abuse."
Linusy Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expresses her innocence to the new baby-career Giselle Maurice, who was black on her first working day in 2016.
"No other black person," Mrs. Plasco Flaxman said to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to a New York Post, after realizing his mistake, an "incompetent" plasco-flaxman fired Ms. Morris, stating that her outgoing grandmother, who was African-American, has done a bad job and that she is expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home in Uber by paying her one-day work.
Now, Morris asks for <0x24>350 per day for a job on the couple and a compensation for six months, in Live-in gigs he was however appointed to start work without any contract.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do such a thing," he said, pointing out that "I know it's discrimination," he said in a post on Friday.
The couple said on the claims that they were racist, stating that after insulting him they could not trust him, it was appropriate to end Morris' employment.
"My wife sent me something that she didn't mean.
He is not a racist.
We're not racist people," Joe Plasco told the Post.
But can you give your children into the hands of someone you have ever insulted, even if it happened by mistake?
"Your new baby?
Leave too."
Like the trial of "abduction," Plasco said his wife had only two months to have children and she was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're following someone like that?"
"It's not fair to do that," the investment banker said.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the couple has reacted quickly to blaming the couple on social media while silenceing them for their behaviour and reasoning.
Padston publishers fear the reader won't link it to their own thoughts and opinions, new letter suggests
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: "It's hard to think of someone having their own place when reading it for the first time before it's published.
It's amazing to know about Pendington's success."
Explaining about his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a small bear toy, he was optimistic about his work being rejected, he said that there were both "happiness and joy" in the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book after his death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as an "important member of her family," she explains that her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a quiet man and not arrogant at all," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to them, it was almost like you have a child who gets something: you're proud of them, even if you're not actually doing it to them."
I think he's seen Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his imagination and creation, he always credited it to Paddington.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the work done by the doctors went waste.
"Nad was regularly saying that it was really bad, it wasn't such an expectation from her," Ms. Adnan-Laparos said.
"Then Nad called me and told me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, son.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine that the doctors had given to beat her heart was gradually ending up leaving her system.
She had died some time ago and all this would have stopped.
I just had to go and sit there and wait, knowing that it was all going to end.
I couldn’t do anything to scream, scream or cry, because I was surrounded by my family.
I had to take care of everyone."
Eventually Mrs. Adenen-Laparos, who was sad about losing her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who were unaware of what they were going through.
"No one knows," he said.
"I put my head down and was crying all the time.
It was difficult to express, but I got to see a sense of extreme sympathy for Nade on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Postcards of women suffering from suicide on bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide want to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on the bridge to Welsh with inspirational messages on which people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
The 45-year-old Mr. Davis, who lives in Lidney, said his son was a promising chef who bursts his smile everywhere.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always said that his smile could shine everywhere.”
However he left work before he died and he lived in a “very dark room.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then searching for his lost brother or sister at the age of 11, committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: “I was constantly worried that there was going to be a cumulative effect.”
Ms. Davis made the card, “To tell people that there are people outside that you can go and talk to, even if it’s a friend.”
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphries, who has been Ms. Davis' friend for years, lost her 15-year-old friend Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say anything that he was feeling sad or sad or something else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we will make some changes to his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he couldn't see them."
She said her death was a big shock to her, but they had to get out of her: "It kept the family squeezing from the inside out.
It made us sad.
But we all had to go ahead and fight."

When the FBI probe began, Kawangua's future was hanging in the middle
"I thought, if I could really find something that he's looking for - a limited time and limited scope investigation - maybe we can bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, as well as fearing that the committee between the alleged biased gridlock is "broken."
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want a FBI investigation?
His unwillingness was due to time.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 – as expected, Republicans perform very poorly, so they will seriously weaken their efforts in the land they wanted to win in the High Court.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the senator, campaigning to support Mr. Kuwangua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him meets his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI submitted its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 democrats currently sitting.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kuwangua could get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, the vice president, had to end it and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'flying' by Kim
The number of fugitives to North Korea went to South Korea fell seven years ago when John-in came to power, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the Ministry of Integration of the South, Park Beyong-Siyog said 1,127 people had left their duties last year as compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Shri Park said that the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and thieves were the main factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
A large number of absconders from the north are eventually proposed to South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The maximum China fled, the longest border with North Korea, and it is easy to cross the reliably protected civilian zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the fugitives as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them back to their country by forcing them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically in a state of war - have seen improvements in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries meet in Pyongyang for talks, focusing on blocking nuclear talks.
It became active after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim John-un in Singapore in June, when they broadly agreed on terms of working towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yang-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress since then.
"Without any faith in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances, we will have no choice but to harm ourselves unilaterally first," Mr Rai said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "fun", saying he wasn't qualified for the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavangua "funny" and said he was ineligible in nature to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I can't think that a woman can perform such a performance, they call it "fun," Pelosi said Thursday, reacting to the evidence of Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanguya emotionally denied allegations that he had ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his early statement, Kavangua was very emotional, sometimes screaming and breathing while talking about his family and his school years.
He clearly punished the Democrats on the committee, proving them to be "violent and cohesive character betrayal" allegations by the liberals, who were angry with Hillary Clinton for losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he feels that the witnesses in Kavangua have proved that he cannot work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he is a proponent of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements as well as the way he went to Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi expressed doubt that if Kavanaugh becomes permanent when asked, and if the Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives, would he still blame Kavanaugh?
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fair to the Supreme Court, but because he's invited, he can work right now," Pelosi said.
Kaavangua is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat, she was concerned about the possible rules of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe V. Wade, as she is known to do conservative justice.
In his certification suit, Kaavangua avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"At the hearing of his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions that he would reverse if he reversed some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
And women need to move it.
It's a religious objection, the anger of months and years comes out and she can't stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stemin told me 45 years later that “When we cry, we get angry.”
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She continued, "A woman helped me a lot with the work of an officer who said that when she also gets angry, she cries, but she has developed a new technique, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, she will say to the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying."
I'm angry."
And then she spoke.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
An early job, one of my most sharp memories of a male head office, when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, found an old woman holding my neck from behind — a sharp manager from whom I had always been a little scared — who dragged me down the stairs.
He said, "Don't cry in front of anyone."
"They don't know how strong you are.
They think that you are sad and that you will be happy to meet them. "
Patricia Schroeder, a woman president of the Democratic Congress from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a boat called Monkey Business by making a relationship with someone other than marriage and his name was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was highly disappointed, decided to take part in the presidential race itself.
“It wasn’t a thought-provoking decision,” she said, laughing at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called him "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was delayed, she didn’t have time to raise money and so she swore that unless she collected <0x24>2 million, she wouldn’t participate in the race.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave men <0x24>1,000 would give him only <0x24>250.
"Do they think I've got a discount?" she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she could not overcome the emotions - thanks to those who supported her, disappointment from the system that made it difficult for her to raise money and frustration from targeted voters, rather than representatives - her suffocation and anger over sexism - began to suffocate.
"You must have thought I would have nervous breakdown down," Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to them.
"You must have thought that Clenx is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they would put on my samadhi.
"She was crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial salvo of the trade war between the US and China was slowing and while the war is still far from over, the rift between countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts said.
US President Donald Trump said the first warning was issued earlier this year by imposing major Chinese export taxes, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week with new tariffs affecting items up to <0x24>200 billion (150 billion) is effectively taxed on more than half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Beijing has resisted in its own way every time, the most recent five to 10 percent of the <0x24>60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-to-shot and the world's second-largest economy is likely to fade soon.
Getting back to Washington means hollowing out the demands, but bending the head in front of the U.S. in public would be very embarrassing for the President of China.
Still, experts say Beijing can move its course, with the U.S. trade war positively supporting China positively over the long term while reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create situations that either trigger economic tailpins in the country, which is actually even more dangerous than what the audience has seen before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New America Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, the foreign minister said
Syria said it was ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild a country devastated by a more than seven-year-long war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Malam said the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation on the ground is more stable and safe because of the progress made against terrorism today," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate in areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for voluntary return of refugees to the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Malam said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating the U.S. team by 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Jordon's teen reaches the 14.5 points needed to defeat the American, Europe again regains its title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled in the maximum tournament, showed his t-shot in the water at the 316th hole across by accepting a match from Francesco Molinary.
Italian golfer Molinary won all his rounds by becoming 1 of 4 players to score 5-0 since starting the tournament's current format in 1979.
American Jordon Spieth was defeated 5 and 4 by the European team's lowest-ranked player Thorbzon Olesen of Denmark.
World's top-ranked player, Dustin Donson lost 2 and 1 to Lane Pollator of England, who probably played his last Ryder Cup.
An experienced of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the European to win every time in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop myself.
It has been a difficult year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm very happy that I was able to help," Gracia said emotionally after Europe's victory.
She thrashed her partner John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Wood 2 and 1 in a single play on Sunday.
“I feel exceptionally proud to beat Tiger Wood, I have grown up watching them,” said the 23-year-old.
Wood lost all his four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career rider cup record.
One of the greatest players of all time has only won 14 major titles in the second place after Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find Fairway with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finneau, who played golf with the entire caliber throughout the tournament.
"I'm proud of these boys, they fought," US captain Jim Furk said after his squad's disappointing performance.
In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
Hes a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA and Ryder Cup Committee of America and move forward with Thomson.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
You should greet them.
We played better."
