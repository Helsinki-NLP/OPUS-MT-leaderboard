The combined cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom are growing rapidly between January 1 and March 15, 2020.
The combined incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases are showing the same pattern in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries, even though there are different stages according to the country.
Based on Italy's experience, the country, hospitals and in-depth medical centers should increase their readiness for the rapidly growing number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care and especially hyper-intensity treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cellulite were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested a new coronavirus as a pathogenic medium, now called severe acute respiratory corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The disease was caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and was named as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
So far, evidence has shown that 80% of people infected with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. with or without pneumonia, respiratory infections and most of them have recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 is a more serious disease, while in the remaining 6%, it is a serious disease that requires in-depth treatment.
The death rate of patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In these studies, we evaluated the nature of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union/Europe Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with China's Hubei Province.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with cases in Italy between January 31 - March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the UK and the European Union
After China, there was a further geographical spread of COVID-19 and the rest of the world's COVID-19 pandemic figures are now following the situation in this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The first case of COVID-19 in Europe was reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 5, 2020, in the publication of the Euroservance 2020, Spitri et al.
In the EU/EEA, France reported the first three confirmed cases returned from Wuhan in China's Hubei province on January 24, 2020.
As of March 15, 2020, all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) have reported COVID-19 cases, including 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Achieving a combined number of COVID-19 cases and cumulative cases
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) records COVID-19 cases from every country in the world, for which information is updated every day at 8:00 a.m. using official sources such as the countries' health ministries, national and regional health authorities, and the WHO.
This data is used to evaluate the nature of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with cases in Italy.
As a sample of the scope of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, for which the natural spread of COVID-19 was considered in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period January 1 - March 15, 2020.
We also presented a cumulative number of reported cases in each country on 15th March 2020 at 8:00 am and compared them with cases in Italy from 31st January to 15th March 2020.
COVID-19 in the UK and the European Union
The overall nature of the 14-day divided cumulative cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA country and the UK is similar to that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative cases of COVID-19 began to rise around February 21 and then began to grow rapidly until February 28, 2020.
This mainly included reported cases of rapid growth in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK were also showing a growing form of the combined cases of COVID-19 (compared content).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK as compared to cases in Italy between January 31-15, 2020.
The number of cases in Italy was already recorded in 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK at 8 am on March 15, three weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that COVID-19 cases are increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed nature of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is growing at a comparatively fast pace in all countries.
Apart from this, while different countries are at different stages, the gap between national public health responses and the possible definition of different cases in countries and different protocols of patient selection must be examined for COVID-19 confirmation, including the catch-up test.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a condition in which 10% of patients suffering from COVID-19 needed an over-intensive therapy, and media sources have indicated that hospitals and over-intensive medical centers in these areas have already reached their maximum potential.
Data for admission of COVID-19 patients to hospitals and/or intensive care centres is currently only available for 6% and 1% cases at the EU/EEA level respectively (the data is not shown).
However, they need to compile current monitoring data in a systemic manner that will focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study found that the number of medical and mid-career beds in Europe is significantly different, with 29.2 beds in Germany per 100,000 population, and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that other countries have less or more resources than Italy (with 12.5 oversimplification medical and moderate medical beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of COVID-19 cases filed in each EU/EEA country and in the UK is associated with the risk of exceeding <0x3E>90% of the intensification capacity, which is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Since the cases are still limited to certain regions of the EU/EEA country and the UK and hospitals and intensive care centres provide treatment to a certain regional population, information on cases and over-intensity of medical centers should probably be made available within the definition of regional centres for the figure 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Italy's experience and current appearance in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly across the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, the country, hospitals and intensive care centres need to prepare themselves for the continued community transmission status of SARS-CoV-2 and for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will need health care and especially intensive care, such as those in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in recent ECDC rapid risk assessments, rather than preventing delays in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, a fast, active and comprehensive approach to niacin is necessary, because if not implemented prematurely, the expected increase in such cases will not allow decision-makers and hospitals to assess, accept and assimilate their responses.
Public health measures have also been listed in a quick risk assessment to destroy the impact of the pandemic.
Here is a brief period of opportunity during which countries can further increase their efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, it is likely that other EU/EEA countries' health care systems will face a surge in patients who will require emergency medical care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe severe respiratory disease (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has so far killed more than 3,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, infecting more than 80,000 people and has been a disaster for humanity.
In 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have been infected with bats, similar to its same sex virus that caused thousands of people to have SARS-CoV, and may have been showing similar symptoms through similar techniques.
However, the severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 is lower than SARS, but the infection is higher and is more prevalent in men and women than in young people.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a timely and inclusive review of the research topic that is evolving.
We have dealt with the basics of epidemiology, itology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
Although there are still many questions left to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and counteract this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 was an unprecedented and unforgettable one for all Chinese people who were asked to stay at home for the entire holiday due to the outbreak of the new infectious disease and many weeks thereafter.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe severe respiratory disease (SARS) in 2003, so on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization named it SARS-CoV-2 and associated disease COVID-19.
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is "the number one enemy of the population" and possibly even more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), within two months, more than 200 research papers have been published on COVID-19 including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first case was reported on January 7, 2020, in addition to the cases of various patients.
This review seeks to summarise the progress of research in the field of new and slowly evolving disciplines.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with the disease caused by SARS and other CoVs, the Middle East respiratory disease (the outbreak in MERS, 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as what we have learned about prognosis, even if there are some leftovers.
CoVs are traditionally considered life-threatening pathogens for humans, causing about 15% of colds.
However, in this century, we have faced the most deadly human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originated in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to other countries with deadly mutations and deaths.
COVID-19 is the third outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups of unknown origin pneumonia were first reported by the China National Health Commission in Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV order was issued.
The first fatal case was reported in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, health care providers were reported to be infected which showed that humans could be infected.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was closed and all public transport was shut down.
The first medical study on the disease on January 24 indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 cases were directly related to the Wuhan Seafood Market, which was considered to be the initial infection center from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was published, the disease had already spread throughout China and 50 countries around the world (figure 2.2).
As the situation changes rapidly, the final state and intensity of the outbreak is still uncertain.
A multi-centre study on 8,866 patients with 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on 11 February 2020 has presented the pandemic's updated picture as follows (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly targeted people in the 30-65 age group.
About half (47.7%) of those infected were under the age of 50, even under the age of 20, and only 14 infected were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.27/1,00,000) more than women (0.31/1,00,000).
COVID-19 has spread mainly to cities in and around Hubei.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of COVID-19 to the diagnosis.
The average holding period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average period from the onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The default reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased drastically before January 23, 2020, matching the large spread of springtime in China.
The mortality rate of the patients including certain cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of the patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (<0x3E>60) and acute pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large and overlapping viruses that contain a single thread of the sensor RNA.
They can be divided into four genes, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to affect humans.
This covering spike (S) binds glycoprotein to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4) respectively, and then causes skin fusion.
Infectious RNA genomes are released into the cell; after replicating the virus genome, the genomic RNA forms virion-containing vesicles with covered glycoproteins and nucleocapsidad proteins, which are then combined with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a new type of beta-CoV that has detected 99.98% genetic identity in 10 sequence samples taken from the outbreak's origin center in Hunan Seafood Market, Hunan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in very thin areas of the human aeration system.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than the S protein of SARS-CoV, which in turn leads to less severe infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce new short proteins, which are encoded by orf3b and secreted proteins are encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b may play a role in infectious pathogens and prevent the expression of IFN<0xC3><0x9F>; however, orf8 does not include any known functional domain or purpose.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., indicated that the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> has been visibly combined with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the amygdala structures that were open and closed, were assembled as a dewormer and ACE2-B0AT1 could bind two S proteins, which provide evidence of the identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug testing to overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Primary and Middle-Earth Host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and had reached humans from stray cats and camels, respectively.
After genetically comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered to be the local host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>21.
However, it is not known which medium carriers helped the virus through the barrier of the species to infect humans, and the path to infection is yet to be clear.
Ji, et al., has suggested that snakes should be carriers from bats to humans, in which same-sex reproduction should occur during S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that the long nose, horny eatable cat used in traditional medicine in China may be a potential medium host of SARS-CoV-2, for which 99% of genetic similarities have been found in the mammal CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is still a large gap of 1% divided into two genomes, so there is a waiting for concrete evidence to come to a conclusive conclusion (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet widely known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in dry environments for up to 48 hours and can live up to 5 days in 20<0xC2><0xB0>C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar properties.
It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 cannot freeze in ultraviolet rays and at a temperature of 56 <0xC2><0xB0> C after 30 minutes, ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated insecticides, perracetic acids, chloroform and other medley solvents other than chloride can effectively do it.
In general, the entire human race cannot cope with SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
At present, no detailed study has been carried out with regard to the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only refer to other studies on CoV, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, when the virus attacks the host, its first pattern is identified by regeneration receptors (PRRs), including C-type lactane-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-RE.
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of flammable elements, the maturation of dendritic cells and type I interference (INN), which limits the spread of the virus and increases the speed of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help protect the virus from the immune response.
Soon, favorable immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes with CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B>T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B>T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8<0x2B>T cells directly destroy virus-infected cells.
T-Helper cells produce cytokines to help the immune cells.
However, COVT can inhibit cell function by involving the apoptosis of T cells.
The human immune system, which includes components and antibodies such as C3A and C5A, is also required to fight viral infection.
For example, the antibodies extracted from the recovered patients have neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperactivity of the immune system largely stems from localized free cell groups that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and can cause various organ damage and even death in bad conditions.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection that begins in the group is most likely to occur in older people and pregnant women with co-morbidities.
Individuals who have other diseases or who have weakened immune systems are more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days, such as the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the average incubation period was between 3 days and 0 to 24 days.
As described above, even recent studies show that the incubation period in the population of 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Combining the effective quarantine period on the basis of the most accurate incubation period is very important for healthcare authorities, which will prevent infected but symptomless people from infecting others.
As a general measure, people who have been exposed to the virus or who have been infected will most likely need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Is it necessary to do the quarantine period for 24 days?
Hemorrhoids are the major and initial symptoms of COVID-19, with symptoms such as dry cough, sneezing, muscle ache, nausea, headache, coughing, renorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients may develop dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the disease.
In severe cases, patients immediately develop severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and cogulopathy.
The virus must be examined for early detection of fever and/or respiratory symptoms and for early detection of patients with severe fever, then whether pulmonary imaging abnormalities are also present.
A demographic study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was as follows: 98% of fever, 76% of dry cough, 55% of dyspnea and 3% of diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar findings have been found in two recent studies on a group infected by a family group and a person with no symptoms.
Comparatively, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as the main symptom.
However, 80% of them needed ventilation support, which was much higher than COVID-19 patients, and the fatality of MERS was higher than that of COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also found in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was observed that fever (99%–100%), dry cough (29%–75%), dyspnea (44%–42%), diarrhoea (20–25%) and throat swab (13–25%) were the main symptoms and about 14%–20% of the patients needed ventilation support.
By February 14, when the number of confirmed cases had reached 66,576, the death rate of COVID-19 was 2%.
Compared to that, SARS' mortality rate as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the death rate based on a demographic study in June 2012 was 37% of 2494 confirmed cases.
Earlier studies had indicated that the RO of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than 6.47 and that 95% of the 5.71-7.23 Confidence Interval (CI), while that of SARS-CoV was between 2 and 4.
In terms of symptoms, mortality and RO, comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is given in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV but less dangerous of both.
Therefore, it is more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The collective start often starts in one family or begins with a single vehicle like a cruise ship.
Patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or have been in contact with infected persons or within the last two weeks prior to the start.
However, it has been suggested that people can hold the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and the recovered patients who have been discharged from the hospital can again carry the virus which has been warned to extend the quarantine period.
The normal or decreasing number of patients at the initial stage has peripheral spleen (particularly lymphocytes).
For example, 1,099 COVID-19 patients had lymphopenia <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L with a swollen blood cell number that included a <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L lymphocyte number and had been found to have advanced aminotransferase levels and viremia.
The level of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin had increased in the blood of some patients and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte layer had increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer in the fibrin degradation product in the blood had increased and lymphocyte count had decreased rapidly.
Most COVID-19 patients had abnormalities in chest radiography and are characterized by pulmonary bilayer patchy sedation or ground glass opacity.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury, and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled rashes, fluid accumulation, and progressive asses strongly affect air exchange.
Deformation in type-1 and type-2 pneumocytes decreases surface level and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the ability to transmit lungs and increasing the risk of pulmonary fibrosis.
Therefore, the worst radiographic findings are often the most serious diseases.
The first diagnostic assessment of COVID-19 on February 18, 2020 showed that the disinfection of pneumocytes, the production of disinfectant curtains and intrusion into the central lymphocyte and the multinucleated synesthetic cell in the lungs of the patient who died of the disease is in sync with the diagnosis and ARDS of viral infections.
The identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through reverse-transcripase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate of speeding up the pandemic, medical disclosures began to be used for diagnosis in China on February 13, 2020 (which is no longer solely dependent on RT-PCR).
A similar situation has also emerged with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, combining the history of the disease, medical disclosure, laboratory tests and radiological findings are important and essential for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhong Group described a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to identify SARS-CoV-2, in which the detection of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fibers from 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 10 <0xC3><0x97> 100 mol/L per 10 <0xC3><0x97> within an hour without the need of a wide range of tools using a dipstick.
It is hoped that if the medical samples are verified, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors can only provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients and can look at other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2) using various treatment methods previously used or proposed.
These treatment methods include current and potential treatments including antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of recovered patients, Chinese medicine and mental support.
Not only this, it was also proposed to use the cells of the recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are making rapid efforts to produce antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lungs initially and may also attack other organs that express ACE2, such as the liver and intestine system and the kidneys in some way.
Therefore, respiratory failure and decomposition poses a major risk to patients and is the leading cause of death.
Therefore, the respiratory system needs to be supported to relieve symptoms and save lives, which includes general oxygen treatment, hi-flu oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invulnerable mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms should be given the basis for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an improved cardiopulmonary bypass technology that is used for fatal cardiac or respiratory disorders.
At the same time, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been found that the additional response to the immune system in SARS and MERS patients results in cytokine storms.
Cytokine storm is the form of a systemic precursor response that appears due to the release of a series of cytokines that include TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce cells of the immune system to release a large number of free radicals, which is the leading cause of ARDS and various organ defects.
Immunospiration is important in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for severe patients.
Anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody corticosteroids and tocilizumab are used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storms include T cell-directed immune response, IFN-Y, IL-1 and TNF inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, bleatinumab, cytokine signaling 4 suppressors, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, in SARS and COVID-19 patients, excessive amounts of steroids were not beneficial for acute lung injury.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which can significantly affect the diagnosis.
However, it is recommended to use low-to-moderate doses of corticosteroids carefully for patients suffering from severe COVID-19.
Till the time of writing this, no effective antiviral treatment was confirmed.
However, it has been found to be effective when a US patient suffering from COVID-19 is given remdesivir by a sedative.
Remdesivir is a unique antiviral drug developed by Jillide to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marlberg virus initially.
Later, Remdesivir showed potential inhibitions for other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Jilid provided these ingredients to China for testing on patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2 and the findings were very promising.
BarriCTNB, Interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, Lopinavir/Retonavir, and Ribavirin have been suggested as possible treatments for patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms.
The combined treatment of Lopinavari/Ritonavir may cause diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The effect of these treatments on other drugs used in patients needs to be carefully monitored.
The production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
The blood of patients recovering from infectious disease has a long history behind collecting it to treat patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from getting sick.
It is true that the blood of the recovered patients has a higher number of antibodies than the pathogens.
Antipyretic antibodies are immunoglobulins (IGs) that are produced by B lymphocytes, which identify specific molecules in pathogens and destroy them directly.
Based on this, cells were collected from the blood of the group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and 10 patients with serious illness were discharged.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, as well as reduced blood pressure and virus pressure, and also improved the circulation of blood vessels.
However, unless specific treatment methods are developed, verification and clarification are required for large-scale use.
At the same time, some of the disadvantages associated with cells need to be carefully considered for therapeutic effects.
For example, antibodies can provoke a response to the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially deadly.
Concentration of blood vessels is generally low, and the demand for cells to treat critically ill patients is high.
It is difficult to quickly develop and produce specific antibodies to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is important and practical to separate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or to check for effective antibodies against the virus' essential proteins.
In this way, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effect is largely dependent on the combination of various components of the formula according to the diagnosis of the disease according to the TCM theory.
Most effective components are unknown or uncertain because it is difficult to remove and verify such elements or their highest combination.
Due to the lack of effective and specific treatment methods for COVID-19 at present, TCM has become one of the alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from severe stages.
For example, <0x58>u Feng Jie do capsules and Lian Hua King Wen capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 patients.
Among the 87% of patients using TCM for treatment of COVID-19, a higher rate of recovery was found in various regions of China, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province where only 30% of COVID-19 patients were used TCM showed the lowest rate of recovery (13%).
However, this is somewhat modest compared to the fact that other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Bid Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing only Western Medicine (WM) with combined treatments of WM and TCM.
They found that the body temperature was much lower in the WM<0x2B> TCM group than the WM group only.
Most importantly, the rate of symptomatic growth (beautiful to intense) was much lower in WM<0x2B>TCM than in the WM group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and also lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than the WM group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, for TCM's effectiveness and safety, large-scale controlled tests need to be carried out in more centers.
It would be somewhat strange to determine the characteristics of the mechanism of action and clarify the components of the TCM treatment or their combination, if possible.
Most of the patients suffering from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experience extremely contagious or lethal diseases, and people with quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Also, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatment such as sleep deprivation caused by corticosteroids can lead to anxiety and mental depression.
In the early stages of SARS outbreak, emotional disorders such as persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, dull symptoms, confusion and feelings of suicide were recorded.
Compulsory tracking and quarantine of contacts as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak may further cause people to be concerned about infection, quarantine, and convictions among family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals and those in contact with them as well as the general public in need.
The mental base includes regular and clear communication about the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health group, accurate news and treatment plans about the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, use of commercial electrical devices, and the use of applications to avoid close contact with others.
There must be an effective vaccine to break the chain of transmission of the virus from animals and from infected humans to susceptible hosts, and this vaccine can also be often used for anti-virus treatment to control the epidemic caused by the emerging virus.
Efforts are being made to develop a protein-based vaccine to produce long-term and qualitative antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-drying vaccines for SARS were evaluated on animal samples.
However, the candidates who were given the vaccine before starting their medical studies have not yet been able to identify the physical efficacy of the vaccine in adults and the protective elements against the deadly challenge pattern and animal-borne virus infection.
The reason for this may be that the effect of SARS ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, rare cases and some mass incidences of MERS have occurred in eastern countries and continue to spread to other regions that show animal-borne sources exist in the epidemiological region.
Vaccination policy for MERS was formulated using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, microbes, virus-like particles and resynchronous protein subunits and some were evaluated on animal samples.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 for non-resistant individuals is an urgent and important task for the current pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulties because it is necessary to develop the vaccine and to have the dynamic diversity of CoVs for a long time (approximately 18 months).
Due to the new disease, COVID-19 has just started showing its complete medical order in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can recover slowly without any recurrence.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high deformity and mortality in severe cases.
Therefore, healthcare institutions are required to set up a diagnostic model in order to prioritise their services, especially in resource-less areas.
Based on the medical studies so far indicated, the following factors may be related to or affect the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
A study of 8,866 cases described above found 47.7% of patients aged over 50 years with COVID-19 were between the ages of 30-65.
Patients in need of intensive care were more likely to have contained disorders and complications and were much older than those who did not (in the middle age of 66 compared to 51), which suggests that age is a diagnostic factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects men more than women (0.31/1,00,000 vs. 0.27/1,00,000).
Co-morbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 in need of hyper-intensive therapy are more likely to suffer from severe heart disease and heart disease.
Heart disease is also one of the leading causes of death in SARS patients.
It has also been suggested that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE-2 positive collagenocytes, which can lead to liver disorders in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to mention that the relationship between age and present diseases is important and can have an impact on each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood indicate the severity of a rash or urinary injury and are a potentially long-lasting diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
The co-ordination of the CRP level with the severity and symptomatic of COVID-19 has also been indicated.
Along with this, increased Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help predict the outcome.
These hormones are widely expressed in various organs, especially in the heart and liver and in tissue damage.
Therefore, they are a traditional viewer for heart or liver disorders.
Major medical symptoms: The momentary increase in chest radiography and medical symptoms should be considered together with other issues to predict the findings and complications of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are used in the form of auxiliary treatments for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
With high doses of corticosteroids being widely used in severe SARS patients, many of the survivors have suffered from life-long disability and life-threatening dislocations.
Therefore, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods of time in COVID-19 patients if needed.
Mental stress: As described above, many patients suffered from extra stress during the COVID-19 outbreak as they had to remain in isolation for a long time and in a very uncertain position and witness the deaths of family members and relatives.
It is essential to provide mental counseling and long-term support so that they recover from stress and return to normal life.
So far, according to demographic studies, the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic are different from that of SARS.
The recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 may be more effective in the upper respiratory tract than in the lower respiratory tract, and mild or no symptoms may occur at the initial stage of infection, similar to other CoVs that can cause colds.
Therefore, infected patients in the initial phase or retention period can produce a large amount of virus during day-to-day operations, which can make it very difficult to control the pandemic.
However, when patients are seriously ill, SARS-CoV infection is thought to spread, most infections do not occur in the early stages.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe than the outbreak of SARS and difficult to control.
A large number of efforts are currently being made in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and nearby cities and keeping the entire population under constant quarantine, so as to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions are causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is still decreasing and the pandemic seems to be slowing down.
The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end by March and the phase of decline will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter has predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini has set up a model to estimate the impact of the pandemic and suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has been found in the mid-turbinate and throttle swab of a patient who was discharged from the hospital two weeks ago after recovering from the disease, which indicates that the newly identified virus may be in a cyclic series like influenza.
However, based on the declining number of new cases, there are promising signs from China, which seem to be having a positive impact on current policies.
It was initially estimated that Ebola would cause millions of cases and 500,000 deaths.
However, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible that like SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 will also weaken until ineffective and eventually become a less pathogenic virus that will eventually be destroyed or co-exist with humans.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with the SARS and MERS pandemic (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious by coughing or sneezing and can also be caused by direct contact with material contaminated by the virus.
The virus has also been found in viscera, which has increased the chances of infection up to viscera-to-tobacco.
A recent study on 138 cases indicated that 41% of cases may have been caused by hospitalized infections, with 17 patients having other pre-existing diseases and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, utmost care must be taken to protect human beings, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and not only those who come in contact with patients or infected people.
The first step to reducing the risk of infection is to use face masks; both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series <0x23>1860s) help prevent the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid points from infecting individuals in a possible form, so that they do not infect others.
However, only N95 (series <0x23>1860) masks can stop the respiration of micro-viruses from 10 to 80 nm, in which only 5% of the virus can go completely inside; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV-2 and both are approximately 85 nm in size.
Since particles can also enter through five surgical masks on one side, healthcare providers who are in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (Series <0x23>1860) without wearing a surgical mask.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers must wear a fitted isolation gown to avoid contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect people through the eyes.
On January 20, 2020, despite wearing an N95 mask, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2; the virus may have entered their body through their burning eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers must use a transparent face covering or Google when working with patients.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas is advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, stay indoors for self-aligning and limit contact with potential infected persons.
Three feet is considered the right distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These actions have been identified as effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus in the human world, as it was reported on January 7, 2020, it should have sounded a bell in China because of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, even on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control told people that the new virus is less contagious and is less reproducing from humans to humans and it is not difficult to prevent and control the disease.
The message greatly reduced the sense of caution among the people, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and missed a crucial time to contain the disease at the minimum level in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can learn from the harshest lessons and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these institutions should take further precautions (1) be more careful while making public announcements because every word told to citizens is important and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) to be more sensitive and responsive to the critical information in the clinics, and to be more sensitive and responsive to the ongoing corrections of the clinics, without waiting for formal reports of doctors or nurses; (3) to put more restrictions on preventing the public at an early stage, rather than giving relief to the public.
The outbreak of COVID-19 was caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2, which started in late December 2019.
Within two months of writing this article, it spread throughout China and 50 countries around the world.
As the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of returning to SARS.
However, there is a significant gap between COVID-19 and SARS, which is important for controlling the pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older men and women more than young people, and the severity and mortality rate are higher in older people than in young people.
The fatality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91 per cent vs. 1.44 per cent).
Even if COVID-19 patients do not have symptoms, the virus infects SARS patients only when they are seriously ill, making it much more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and more widely than SARS-CoV-2.
Regular RNA evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients can be re-positive due to the virus.
These findings have significantly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
These rapid advances in research on COVID-19 have not solved many important issues, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Even if 96% of the genetic sex was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
Which animal was a medium species to infect the virus from the original host, bat or human?
Without knowing the answers to <0x23>1 and 2, we can't effectively stop the infection and the outbreak can never come back again.
Even though molecular modelling and biochemical assessments demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the airborne cells and then how does the pathogen change?
Does the virus also bind ACE-2 expression cells to other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during infection in humans?
Will it be a global pandemic, like SARS, or will it continue to spread like a flu?
The answers to the above and many other questions need to be found, but it may take some time.
However, whatever happens, we have no choice but to get rid of the pandemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normal.
The origins of the human coronavirus
For thousands of years, the co-creators and adaptations of their tissues, including the corona virus (CoV) and humans, are encouraged by mutations and adaptations.
Before 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoV) were known to cause mild diseases such as colds.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS) and Middle East respiratory disease (MERS) has shown how devastating and fatal the HCoV infection is.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 surprised us with its high transmissibility, but its pathogenicity was lower than its co-morbidity with SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and therefore it is beneficial for us to understand the origin of HCoV's animal disease.
Most of the HCoVs originate from bats where they are non-hazardous.
Some of the HCoV intermediate parasitic positions are also known.
The identification of animal tissues can have a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
The discovery of the interplay of CoVs in animals can shed light on important information on the CoV pathogen in humans.
In this review, we are presenting a review of the existing information of seven HCoVs, whose main focus is on the history of their discovery as well as the origin and interspecies transmission of their animal disease.
Importantly, we compare different HCoVs from the point of view of virus development and genome recombination.
In this context, the current COVID-19 pandemic has been discussed.
Apart from this, the need to successfully change the posture and the impact of the virus' evolution on the severity of the disease has also been highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoV) belongs to a family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of induced, positive-sensed, single-straight RNA viruses.
In these RNA viruses, which shelter the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases, they look like a crown under an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have undivided genomes that share the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genomes contain two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicas polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, which are ranked as NSP1-16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORFs for structural proteins, including spikes (S), entropy (E), membranes (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
A number of hereditary-specific assistive proteins are also encoded by different hereditary genes of CoVs.
COVs are classified into four generations according to different protein sequences (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV generation consists of the highest number of HCoVs and would have divided them into four generations (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and rats serve as genetic sources for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the mainstay for Gamma-CoV and Delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have been constantly crossing the barrier of species and have emerged as important human pathogens.
Currently, there are seven known human CoVs.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe respiratory infections in relatively high patients who are at higher risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestation.
In the 1960s, the first HCoV-229E pathology was isolated from the nasal swabs of common cold patients.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which produce self-limiting symptoms.
As such, there was a widespread perception that the infection caused by HCoVs was generally harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history, infecting more than 8,000 people with an estimated 10% of the crude case fatalities.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a continuous outbreak of epidemics on the Arabian Peninsula that quickly spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, was an ongoing epidemiological medium of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which had killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell is constantly ringing and the world needs to be prepared for the coming global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The origin of all seven ACOVs is in bats, rats or pets.
Various evidence reinforces the theory of origin from bats, in which the virus assimilates the situation and is not pathogenic but shows extraordinary genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracking the origins of the animal disease of ACOV shows the structure of natural history, movement force, and restriction factors behind the species' growth.
This will also guide or facilitate the detection of SARS-CoV-2 shelters, intermediaries and amplifier parasitic (V) cushions, which will help in preventing its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide a review of the origins of animal diseases, interspecies infections and pathologies of HCoVs.
Specifically, we focus on the following common themes and discuss that the parent virus of HCoVs is not usually pathogenic in its natural parasites but becomes pathogenic when an interspecies infection occurs in new tissues.
We also reviewed the trend of HCoV evolution in which if the infection increases, the pathogenesis decreases.
The impact of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
Since the late 1930s, animals have been known to be CoVs.
The HCoV-229E pathology B814 was first isolated from infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the past decade.
A brief summary (Table 1) of the discovery of HCoVs in the order of calculation will be informative and suggestive.
In 1966, the first HCoV-229E pathology was isolated from patients suffering from upper respiratory tract infection, and since then WI-38 pulmonary cell lines have increased.
HCoV-229E showed symptoms of cold in infected patients including headache, coughing, pimples and sore throat, as well as fever and cough in 10-20% of cases.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the small rat's organ culture and later from the brain's syllables.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection were similar to those of HCoV-229E, which are not distinguishable from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread globally and are mainly infected during the winter season in low-temperature environments.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week after which the disease occurs for about two weeks.
According to a study on human volunteers, HCoV-229E has developed milder colds in infected healthy individuals.
Only a few of the weak immune patients have a severe infection of lower respiratory tract.
SARS, known as "ATPICAL Pneumonia," was the first properly documented universally transmitted HCoV in human history and the etiological factor is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in Guangdong province of China.
The outbreak of SARS has resulted in 8,096 cases, including 774 deaths, which have spread to many countries and continents.
Without over-spreading, it is estimated that each case can cause approximately two secondary cases, with a boiling period of 4 to 7 days, and the virus' impact can be seen on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV may initially experience muscle pain, headache, fever, fungi and chills and then difficulty breathing, coughing and then breathing.
There are common abnormalities found in the laboratory of lycopene, broken liver function tests, and increased creatine kines.
Diffuse alveolar damage, elevated cell growth and increase in macrophages have also been found in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of the patients need superintendence and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, liver, and kidneys of the liver and intestines can also be infected with this serious disease, most likely cytokine storms, which can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immune system.
The virus was first isolated from an open-length biopsy of a patient's relative who arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, efforts have been made to develop the HCoV.
In late 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a seven-month-old baby in the Netherlands.
It was initially found to be more common in young children, the elderly, and patients with respiratory problems with impaired immune system.
HCoV-NL63 causes fever, colds, and shortness of breath.
Another independent study in the Netherlands described the virus as being isolated from an eight-month-old baby's nose.
Although it is found in the Netherlands, it has spread all over the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and most of its outbreaks occur early in summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive rheumatoid arthritis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old hospitalized in Hong Kong for pneumonia and respiratory disease.
HCoV-HKU1 is associated with acute asthma eradication, including community-acquired pneumonia and respiration.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is also found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs are well-accepted in humans and are less likely to develop into highly pathogenic diseases, but accidents can occur due to unknown reasons such as the occurrence of more viral subtypes of HCoV-NL63, which have recently been reported to have caused severe respiratory infections in China.
In general, when these HCoVs gain the ability to be infected efficiently and sustainably in humans, they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in Saudi Arabia in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient who had severe pneumonia and kidney problems.
Although the majority of confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, the cases of secondary transmission imported from close contacts were reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The medical signs of Mars are similar to SARS, which are manifested by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS suffered from severe kidney failure, which is very uncommon for MERS in HCoV-related diseases.
The number of patients with symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting was more than 30%.
As of February 14, 2020, there were more than 2,500 confirmed cases with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to mankind.
Between mid-December 2019 and the end of 2019, a group of pneumonia patients with virilized SARS-CoV-2 infection began to appear in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a low respiratory infection outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with crude case fatality rate of 3.4%.
China's Hubei case fatality rate was 4.2%, while outside China it was 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 is caused by acute respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are characterized by fever, cough and respiratory problems.
In some patients, there was also an overdose.
Pneumonia was one of the most severe symptoms and could rapidly increase severe respiratory distress syndrome.
Although the high nucleotide sequence is very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to homogeneity, they are in different branches in the phylogenetic structure.
SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has reported non-communicable patients and may have contributed to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs shows a great deal of similarity and disparities.
Firstly, the boiling period and the duration of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the one hand, is characterized by symptoms that occur during normal HCoV infections, including non-specific, mild or non-specific symptoms.
On the other hand, even if the number is low, there is also a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 in the case of SARS-CoV infection.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows the peculiarities of both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs received by the community.
On the one hand, the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of HCoVs from the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmission capacity of SARS-CoV-2 decreases as the spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV into humans decreases.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also be seen in virulence samples.
Whether SARS-CoV-2 can play an important role in at least some situations, such as SARS-CoV, is to be clear from future studies.
It will also be interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 shows seasonality, just like the cases of HCoVs received from the community.
Nevertheless, the SARS-CoV-2 features, including the characteristics of infectiousness, pathogenicity and sustainable spread in humans, will be effective for the final future of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
HCoVs from all four communities that produce mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCoV epidemic.
HCoVs and human-caused serious diseases should be eradicated.
In order to do this, to the extent sufficient to store favorable mutations, let HCoVs be replicated in humans which would fail to inhibit the tissues.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to be fully compatible with humans.
If it is well-suited, it will be difficult to stop its spread among humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
Four CoVs from the community have been circulating in humans for many years, causing people with weakened immune systems to get cold.
These animals do not need a shelter.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not properly adapted to humans and their infection in humans will not last forever.
They must be allowed to maintain and spread in their animal shelters and spread through one or more intermediaries and amplifiers as far as possible to reach the sensitive human target.
The salient features of SARS-CoV-2 are similar in both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs derived from the community.
At the moment, it is very contagious as the HCoVs from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs obtained from the community and is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
They will be fully compatible with humans without shelter or intermediary animal poses and will continue to see if they will spread to humans.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be appropriate for you to discuss the definitions and features of evolutionist, natural, dependencies, intermediaries and amplifier poshinda of HCoVs.
An animal can become a vulture of the evolution of HCoVs if it has sheltered a close relative ancestor who shares high homogeneity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
In these conditions, the anterior virus is often adapted and is not pathogenic.
Similarly, parasitic vein provides permanent and long-term shelter to HCoVs.
In both cases, the vein is naturally infected and has a natural vein of the HCoV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if the HCoV is inserted into the host even before or during its introduction to humans, it does not adapt to new tissues and often becomes pathogenic.
These intermediaries can then act as animal shelters for human infection and cross the role of breeding gear by allowing the virus to be transiently replicated and then infecting humans to expand the scope of human infection.
An HCoV infection may end up if it is not able to sustain its infection in the intervening vein.
On the contrary, HCoVs can accept middle-stress and not only that, but also establish long-term disease.
In this case, the intermediate positioning becomes the natural parasitic positioning.
Epidemiological data has revealed that the contact history of the first case of SARS has been shown to be with predatory animals.
Later seroprevalence studies showed that the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-IGG was higher in animal traders than in the general population.
Masked palm civets (paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs were first identified in the animal market while carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that were similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly reinforced by the fact that there were no further SARS cases after killing all the civets in the market.
However, it was also noted that the masked palm civets in the forest or fields that were not in contact with the animal market were mostly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets may be intermediate amplifiers but that SARS-CoVs may not have natural habitats.
It is worth noting that 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou market had anti-sars-CoV antibodies, so the possibility that different species of small mammals would also work as a medium-enhancing device for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these are seen as the final frontiers of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent discovery of SARS-CoV for natural animal tissue led to the discovery of a closely related bat CoV, which was called SARS-related renolopes bat CoV HKU3 (SARS RH-BATCOV-HKU3), which exists in the Chinese Horseshoe bat.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and for the genome sequence of SARS-RH-BATCoV-HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homogeneity with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats feed on human pathogens that are developing.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) were identified from bats, but none other than WIV1 were isolated as living viruses.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered a receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 was obtained from a sample of bats, which were shown to be used as a customer for the penetration of bats, civil and human ACE2 cells.
The interesting fact is, the blood of the SARS patient who had recovered from the disease was able to avert WIV1.
Thus, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats that share 95% of the nucleotide sequence homogeneity.
Although there is a high homogeneity between these two viruses, it is generally understood that WIV1 is not the intermediate parent virus of SARS-CoV, and bats are not the immediate parasites of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis combines Mars-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 and Bat CoV-HKU5.
Vagabonds use CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV poshinda receptors, dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4) for virus penetration.
The sequence of RNA-delayed RN polymers of Mars-CoV is closely related to variants found in bat beta-CoVs in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live Mars-CoV has been found in the wild.
MERS-CoV and its closely related bat CoV-HKU25 account for 87% of the nucleotide sequence homogeneity.
Thus, it is likely that there will be no immediate parasitic position of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies conducted in the Middle East have shown that the Dromedrie camels are seropositive to the specific sterile antibodies of the MERS-CoV, as are the camels of the Middle East origin found in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV is similar to the virus found in humans that was isolated from the swab in the nose of the dromedary camel, further indicating that the camel acts as a beneficiary of MERS-CoV.
It is pertinent to note that though generally mild symptoms were identified, a large number of experimental virology patients took shelter in infected camels by MERS-CoV.
Notably, the infected camels not only give shelter to the virus through respiration, but also through defecation, which is also the main route to the shelter of the virus from bats.
However, the question remains as to whether many cases confirmed by Mars have no contact history with camels before symptoms appear, human-to-human transmission routes or unknown infection routes in which unrecognized animal species are likely to cause the mars-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homogeneity with the bat COV RATG13, which is isolated from rhinolofoss-related bats.
As is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the order variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is very good at determining this parenting relationship.
This means that bats are likely to not have an immediate parasitic position of SARS-CoV-2 unless the same bat-CoV is found in the future.
Most SARS-CoV-2 intermediary poached animals must belong to a wildlife species that must have been sold and killed at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with many of the earliest cases related to COVID-19, which are indicative of the possibility of the occurrence of the infection.
Numerous recent studies based on the metagenomic sequence suggest that a group of small mammals in distress known as the pangolins (Manis javanica - Khawla cat) may also be a haven for SARS-CoV-2-related ancestor beta-CoVs.
These new pangolins share 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RATG13 at the level of nucleotide sequence approximately 90% homogeneous.
They are grouped into two sub-sectors in a venomous hereditary tree such as SARS-CoV-2, one of which shares more than 97.4% amino acid sequence identification with SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast to the inevitable truth, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are more different, although the higher levels are high proportions of genome-wide homogeneity sequence.
Recent research on the diseased pangolins has also recorded the presence of a virus layer on the lung sample, which was found to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The research adopted a different assembly method and physical curation to create a partial genome sequence of about 86.3% of the full-length virus genome.
You cannot exclude the possibility of having a pangolin in one of the intermediate animal positions of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the origin of SARS-CoV-2 being directly pangolins due to the sequence variations between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is also much less than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
It remains to establish a path to the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals.
While RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolins has the highest order homogeneity, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homogeneity.
There is widespread speculation that there is a high level of similarity between the pangolins SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, which is borne by the evolutionary evolution of selective rheumatic-drugism.
Pangolins SARS-CoV-2 is an alternative proposal in the benefit of recombination between the respective beta-CoVs and RATG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread in beta-CoVs.
The jury is still looking for the immediate animal origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Genetic evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are caused by bats, while parents of HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 have been found to have been infected with the virus.
It has been reported that the ARCov.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) in the North American triangular bat has shown close association with HCoV-NL63.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, is related to a chromatography in another bat CoV, named as Hipposidros/Ghanaquam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while the camels were suspected as their intermediary vessels.
For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origin of known HCoVs in Figures 1 and Table 2.
The evidence of interspecies transmission of HCoVs in history has been presented by hereditary analysis.
When the HCoV-OC43 from domestic animals crossed the species to infect humans around 1890, the respiratory system's association with the infection was recorded.
The interspecies history of HCoV-229E is very clear.
The bat alpha-CoV, which is closely related to HCoV-229E, has been found.
They have an alpha-CoV.
There are several levels of evidence supporting the direct transmission of the virus to humans from bats.
First of all, it is likely that humans have come into contact with bats in a shared environment, not alpacas.
Instead, humans are more closely related to each other.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are isolated and non-pathic in alpha-CoV bats, while Alpacas alpha-CoV has caused the outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Alpacas alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility of alpacas getting HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is not surprising that HCoV-229E can be transmitted directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoV is the genetic stock of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels can act as intermediaries that can infect viruses in humans, as did in the case of Mars-CoV.
Mars-CoV has served as the best example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The origin of the evolution of Mars-CoV from bats is known for its early identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
It is apparent that bats provide a rich stock of virus species for interspecies exchange of infection between genetic fragments and interspecies.
All these ideal conditions, such as long life, bitter colonialism, near social interaction and ability to fly, have made the bats ideal as a 'Violent Broadcaster'.
On the other hand, Mars-CoVs have entered the dromedary camels for decades.
These camels have well-accepted them which has made them stable and natural parasitic cushions from the intermediary position.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Infection to humans is an accident and the human remains in the stage of the Mars-CoV because its infection does not survive.
The role of camel in the transmission of MERS-CoV is, in the confluence of SARS-CoV-2, the role of Pangolins, if any, in contradiction.
In particular, pangolins beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be a step-by-step preparation for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, as is the case with SARS-CoV cases.
In future research, it should be considered or denied that there is a myriad of possibilities for interspecies transmission from SARS-CoV-2 to humans.
First of all, bats can be parasites of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share the environment with bats by slaughtering them or through coal mines.
Second, Pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifiers that have recently been identified with SARS-CoV-2-related virus.
Human contact with the virus is caused by slaughtering and hunting fish.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, are sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of pets and wild animals is required for the specimens.
Thirdly, as noted above, the recombination and acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 can be found in third species that are in contact with bats and pangolins.
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation.
In addition to the variety of animal carcasses, three key aspects on the side of the CoV virus are also important in facilitating the crossing of the barrier of another species.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared with other single-straight RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoV depends on the stage of acceptance of the new COVID by the new site, with an average replacement rate of -10-4 per site per year, which can be calculated as "smiling" to "high."
The CoV has evidence-reading exorbitant exorbitant claustrophobics, which removal also results in overcoming and debilitating mutations or even immobilization of life.
Surprisingly, nucleotide analogic remdesivir is known to inhibit these exorbitant and RNA-dependent RNA polymers to replicate the CoV.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising remdesivir agents against SARS-CoV-2 being tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rate of CoVs is about a million times higher than their position rate.
In addition, the mutation rate is always high when the CoVs are not well-accepted by the vein.
Compared with SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly low, indicating higher levels of acceptance to humans.
It may have been used by other humans.
This also applies to SARS-CoV-2, which is well accepted by Dronedrie Utani.
Theoretically, it is impossible that genetic dissipation would lead to immunization and condition-viral by ineffective hydrology against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, large RNA genomes in CoVs tend to absorb extra amounts of flexibility in genome correction to mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the possibility of interspecies co-involution, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when the situation becomes amicable.
This is supported by many other open readable frames and by the protein actions that are encrypted to the end of the genome at the end of 3'.
Thirdly, CoVs switch templates between RNA replicas randomly and repeatedly through other such "copy-chosen" mechanisms.
In the vein they act as a mixing vessel, the strand switching occurs frequently during the transcription of the COV RNA.
High levels of homogeneous full-length and sub-genomic RNA can be recombined to create new CoVs.
The hereditary evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Interactions between viruses and viruses in connection with infection
In addition to the three viral aspects mentioned above, the viral interaction with the vein recipient is another important factor which is impressive in interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a sample example, which has also shown evidence of positive selection during interspecies infection events.
Based on a comparative analysis of segregation of human and CVT SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV appears to have been rapidly accepted in different positions, especially with mutations in the RBD of S protein.
In general, in the RBD in S protein, the CoV interacts with the pediatric recipient and is selected by the vigour of the vein by the antipin response to the vein.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is located on the S1 segment in the 318th to 510th amino amla, which binds human ACE2 as well as recipients with them to access the virus.
The RBD of SARS-CoV allows interspecies transmission of the virus capable of identifying various animal ACE2 recipients, including bats, ovaries, rats and raccoons dogs.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be isolated in the RBDs of the human and civil virus segregated, and 4 of them are located in the recipient-bond image for interaction with the ACE2 recipient.
The K4889N and S487T mutations in CVT SARS-CoV are in their RBD, which can reinforce the interplay of spike protein with human ACE2 recipients.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids can be important in virus acceptance for humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same pulmonary recipients with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that the human ACE2 of their S protein may have been altered.
Of course, a cryo-EM study has shown that the desire for these hostages is between human ACE2 and SARS-CoVS protein by 10- to 20-foot higher than that of the hostages.
It will also be of interest to determine the requirement of any other co-customer for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
HCoV-NL63 may also be associated with ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are a number of other HCV customers such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adoption of these CoVs into humans after interspecies infections from their animal nutrients.
As an emphasis in pessimistic clients, the impact of an interspecies infection of HCoVs is also controlled by dependency and preventive factors on other nutrients.
Disruption of this nutrient protein between natural cumulative nutrients of HCoVs such as human and bats, dromedary camels and rodents can hamper interspecies transmission.
HCoVs have to strengthen the nutrient-dependent components for successful interspecies infections, and the nutrient-restricted components have to be removed.
In this context, it remains to be identified and determined the characteristics of the radioactive determinants in the part of this important virus-infected interplay.
Using CRISPR’s state-of-the-art technology for SARS-CoV-2, a non-prejudicial scrutiny of the genome-wide and containment factors of nutrient dependence may be useful.
The emergence of new HCoVs: Going back to zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides plenty of opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
Thus, bats act as a genetic stock of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also trigger HCoV mutations and act as two important stages in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically change the viral scenario.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 is considered to be important to be accepted in humans, as SARS-CoV-related bats are found to encode ORF8 proteins while they are isolated.
Species isolated at the beginning of the disease with humans have identified the characteristic of the removal of 29-nucleotide of SARS-CoV.
Due to the removal of it, ORF8 is divided into ORF8a and ORAP8B and is considered to be an acceptable mutation, which promotes the migration of nutrients.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination with the lineage of alpha- and gamma-CoV, with large numbers of small recombination parts found in RNA.
Reconnaissance locations were also identified in the NSP9, often in the NSP10, and in some parts of the NSP14.
Similarly, it has been shown that epidemiological mars-CoVs have experienced recombination events in different hereditary genera, which have been found in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been identified in these other HCoVs, in which other animals like HCoVs recombine in their non-structural genes with COVs.
Artificial selection can also contribute to the undesirable change of the virus genome, which is most often relieved of the selective pressure used by the immune system of the virus.
The HCoV-229E prototype is an example of this result in the loss of full-length ORF4 and the removal of two nucleotides.
Unit ORF4 can be found in HCOC-229E-related bats and camel viruses, showing alpha-CoV single nucleotide inclusion, which was effected in the frameshift.
Last but not the last, the evolution of new HCoVs is also made possible by the pressure of choice in their parasitic positions.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected when the bat was infected with the CoV, which indicates mutual acceptance between the CoV and the bat.
It seems that bats have accepted CoVs well physically and physically.
For example, the defect in activation of the pre-infection response to the batter reduces the efficacy of the pathology implemented by the CoV.
In addition, the concentration of natural killer cells in bats decreases due to the upward regulation of the reciprocal natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low level of exposure to the composite category I molecule of the main tissue.
In addition, both the high levels of reactive oxygen type (ROS) generated from high-volume activity of bats suppresses the CoV replication action and affect the profuriniga through exorabonucles, thus providing a large proportion of the virus's genetic origin to be selected when it enters a new nutrient.
The more pathogenic CoV herb was also evolved in recombination, leading to the acquisition of new protein or protein characteristics to accept nutrients.
Thus, these three new HCoVs have not arisen in the last two decades.
CoVs cause non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their parasitic vein such as bats or camels.
These powerful muscles produce impurities without removing the immune response.
Here's why extraordinary vessels appeared and what is causing a serious problem in human infection is hidden.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by high activation of the immune response and cytokine storm, while where the immune response is more potent, more severe forms of lung damage appear to be occurring.
On the contrary, in an asymptomatic carrier, the immune response from replicating the CoV has been decomposed.
In SARS-CoV-2 treatment, the same can be a beneficial strategy to break down the immune response.
Interferon's response, in particular, is strong.
Thus, the management of at least type-I interferon should be beneficial in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, NLRP3 inhibitory activation in bats is faulty.
For this reason, the MCC950 co-sponsor of the NLRP3 donor can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general method, through which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerge.
On the contrary, it was found that 95% of nucleotide homogeneity in bat's beta-CoV was shared with SARS-CoV, where 96% of nucleotides in bat-CoV exist with SARS-CoV-2.
However, since the virus, such as SARS-CoV, has been found to be a haven for humans and other animals in the market, there has been no immediate identification of intermediate conditions for SARS-CoV-2.
The homogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 in pangolins beta-CoVs has been remarkably found, indicating that pangolins may have served as one of the intermediaries or that pangolins may have contributed to genetic fragmentation in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is either intentionally or by accident.
The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the resurgence of COVID-19.
Studies in bats and other animals have radically altered the perception of the importance of the parasitic position of HCoVs in its animal origin and human transmission.
Evidence of dispersal showed that there was an origin of bats between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and that its human-infections were caused by intermediaries.
The origin of SARS-CoV infection was in contact with the human and Ud Manger market, with the closure of the seafood market and the killing of Ud Mangera there effectively ending the SARS-CoV epidemic.
For the same reason, considering the discovery of the multiple lineage of pangolins beta-CoV being closely related to SARS-CoV-2, Pangolins should also be removed from the seafood market to prevent animal infections.
However, future research has yet to reveal whether and how SARS-CoV-2 has been transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in existence in the dromedary camel for a long time.
It is an important mode of transport and has been the main source of meat, milk, skins and wool products for the local people.
They are widely spread in the Middle East and Africa.
As was done in China's wild life market to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of Mars.
To prevent the recurrence of Mars, the gross approach to develop an effective vaccine against a MERS-CoV for camels, should be undertaken with the integration of other infection control measures.
Because we can't eradicate this virus, new forms of the virus can cause an outbreak.
There are also a variety of animal species in the wild.
In particular, bat CoVs are also very diverse with animal potential.
There are numerous opportunities for evolution and recombination in these animal CoVs, which will result in the emergence of a new CoV of a more transmissible and/or lifelike form in humans in the future.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some places in China.
In the order of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a good kind of preparation and response plan should be prepared.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their natural habitat until they have the opportunity to expand.
Although bats have many characteristics of spreading the virus, people can be reduced by being trained to stay away from bats and other wildlife species.
In order to better understand the life cycle of CoVs and their natural tissues, there is a need to continuously monitor mammals, which can be useful in preventing human infection from animals and future outbreaks.
To put an end, keeping humans away from the natural habitats of the animal virus is the most effective way to prevent the animal virus.
Several parts of the animal origin code of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
For the first time, if an ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 is infected with pangolins, it will be interesting to see what conditions the bats and pangolins share the same ecological location.
Second, if bats have played a more direct role in human infections, it will have to determine how humans got into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if the third mammals really acted as intermediaries, it must be clear how they interact with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, many mammals, including pets, should be injected with the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being sensitive, monitored and experimentally infected.
Whether it is bats, pangolins, or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestor virus will be identified in their natural tissues in the future.
The ongoing exploration in the region will explore the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, the key in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19.
On February 6, 2020, our team has published Quick Advice Guidelines for Intravenous Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and these guiding principles have made a good reference to our well-being and the fight against the pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease. Our awareness and knowledge is growing gradually based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience, so, the diagnostic and treatment strategy is also constantly updated.
In this letter, a comment has been made on our guideline and the latest diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 (seventh edition) "specified cases" and "confirmed cases" according to the latest diagnosis and treatment provided by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak was officially named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named Civil Acute Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick advice guides and has been published online in Military Medical Resurgence on February 06, 2020.
It has received a lot of attention since its publication.
Note that even though COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness-raising knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and medical practice; so diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), published by the National Health Committee (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), has changed some of the seven frequency of diagnostic and treatment guidelines published for COVID-19 from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020.
Now that our guidelines have received comments by Zhou et al., they have submitted a simple multiplication proposal based on their medical experience.
His work has added new evidence to our guidelines and has also made a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We appreciate his work and thank him for it.
However, his work also needs to be updated according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (Test VII) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of suspected cases requires that any one item of the specialty of epidemiological history be combined with two items of medical invention, or three items of medical invention be completed if there is no clear epidemiological history.
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of travel or residence in the area of Wuhan city and its surroundings, or 14 days prior to the appearance of symptoms such as cases of COVID-19 in the area of the person who has been infected with the disease; (2) the history of the contact with such cases in the community (including the presence of previous cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection); (3) the history of contact with the Wuhan city and surrounding areas.
Medical invention: (1) symptoms of fever and/or respiration; (2) with an imageal characteristic of the infection with COVID-19; (3) showing the total number of white cells in the early stages of normal decline, or decreased lymphocytes.
Diagnosis of confirmed cases should be on the basis of suspected cases with either one component of either pathogenic or serological evidence as given further: (1) the real-time PCR test should be positive for SARS-CoV-2 mutations in acute IMG-II; (2) the known novel coronavirus showing a high deterioration of the virus, and the entire genetic sequence of the virus in the serum test (3)
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or in the blood sample was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and the third (January 22, 2020) frequency
The pathogenic identification of blood samples was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020) frequency; and later in the seventh edition, serological evidence was added.
These improvements are based on the regular work of researchers, including the detection of optimal nucleic acids for this quick diagnosis, as well as the inclusion of blood samples from the respiratory tract, which have increased the availability of different samples, and have been supported to bring a positive effect of specific antibodies in confirmed criteria.
Apart from that, there was more and more evidence that reminded us to be cautious with a symptomatic and asymptomatic patient.
Therefore, the flowchart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they are classifying a person as "low risk" without medical symptoms.
There is also a need to verify the multiplier system in further clinical practice and studies.
To conclude, we hope that more direct evidence will come to give readers their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases," we must follow and follow the latest guidelines of his homeland.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 in a single day.
The virus causes the highest number of deaths in the day.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 active cases and 33 recoveries of the infected cases that are living at home, as reported by the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR).
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
In an online briefing, Dr. Mirzade Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said the dead included four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Mirzade, the two cases were between the ages of 60 and 51, and one between the ages of 41 and 50.
He also said that two of the victims were from the area.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
One of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Friendship Hospital in Kuwait, hospital officials said.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh Minister for Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transport will remain closed for a longer period than originally planned.
The public transport shutdown was scheduled to begin on March 26 and end on Saturday April 4.
Transportation of essential commodities - medical, fuel and non-essentials - is still permitted.
On March 8, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Bangladesh, including the wife of two people who had returned from Italy.
On March 19th, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has crossed one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, John Hoffkins University data showed that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia confirmed their coronavirus-related death.
North Korea on Thursday claimed it was one of the few countries to be free from the coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed 1,051,635 cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10.00 a.m. of Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been reported, of which 5,900 have been linked to death.
CBS News quoted John Hoffkins University data, informing that more than 1,000 people died in the U.S. on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Around the world, strict measures have been announced to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, postponed the lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that he would continue to pay Russian workers until April 30.
Portugal's parliament extended the national and state of emergency by 15 days, passed the resolution by 215 votes, 10 abstentions, and one vote was against it.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a full-day curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina: earlier, the curfew was only from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand is planning to impose a curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has extended his stay at home order until May 1.
Australia's retail stores have reduced the number of toilet paper per transaction.
On Sundays and Saturday evenings. The Australian store chain Woolworths and Coles reduced the ban on the purchase of its toilet paper to a national level on two and one package per transaction, respectively.
Aldi also launched a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits are posted as messages on checkout and on the chain's Facebook page.
If people need self-isolation, buyers are stocking up again in fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted each purchase to so much a pack per order for home delivery.
These changes have come after four-pack restrictions on previous transactions submitted by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 appearance, reported a four-pack ban, "many stores are selling within an hour of delivery," and said the demand was "unbelievable," while ALDI, on their Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unprecedented."
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, there has been a "big increase" in sales over the past week.
Costco's store in Canberra also reduced the amount of these two packs last week.
To further reduce the deficit, Coles ordered a larger package from suppliers and increased the delivery frequency. Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made early availability for planned Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailer's Association, said the retailer tried to increase the stock, but that it had become more difficult due to the local council's time-restriction of the truck-supply.
They expect an increase in the cost of production, as the suppliers have to meet the demand, and the special to a lesser extent.
On Tuesday, ADLI announced that due to the early dispatch of sixty, some stores will not be able to run specials on Wednesday.
In the report of News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer expert at the University of Queensland, said that the stores are filling stock every night.
They beat Shera that toilet paper is a large item, which leads to a low amount of storage in numbers, and, when sold, vacates a large amount of shelf space.
Coles and Woolworths showed the scene [Ki] if there were numerous objects on the self, such as toilet rolls and sanitizers, and there were a lot of them there, you would be less likely to panic, said Russell Zimmerman, according to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper who gave a crap said that the stock from him has been exhausted.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent, emphasized that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply smooth.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that they were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder on its auction in Melbourne, when some auctions were held due to the buyers having time during the large weekday of the workday.
In Thursday's edition of NT News, eight water inserts were added to Darwin's daily print, cut java and used as toilet paper.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, the store was originally against the ban, in which it said it had no plans to impose any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman stated that there is also a huge demand for this product, which includes masks, sanitisers, dry items, handwashes, and benches.
Similarly, outside Australia, the British online supermarket Ocado on Sunday evening restricted the purchase of Andres toilet paper to a 12-roll two pack.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday as a pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "globalization" is related to just how dangerous a disease is, rather than just how dangerous it is, the WHO has stated that concrete action needs to be taken by governments.
All countries can still change the pace of this global pandemic
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, "If nations recognize it as a response, conduct tests, treatment, quarantine, backtrack, and unite our people in this fight."
We are deeply concerned by both the spread and seriousness and the inaction at the dangerous level.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former head of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this is "unprecedented" with the world.
In comments published in CNN in February, he said, "No other respiratory virus has been tracked from the emergence of influenza to global transmission."
"We've never seen anything like this before with the world that's caused by the coronavirus," said Ghebreyesus.
He added: "We have never seen a world where we can control ourselves.
The current state of the global pandemic is in line with the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak as a public health emergency in January.
Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, said: "It is certain that this situation will worsen further."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus, which has been linked to the global COVID-19 (COVID-19), is caused by SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes acute respiratory deformity.
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency of global concern on January 30, 2020, and has been recognized as a global co-operation since March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, nearly 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories and resulted in nearly 97,000 deaths.
About 3,64,000 people have been cured.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at 4%, from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and sneezing.
Symptoms of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress can be found in cases of complications.
The time from infection to symptoms is usually about five days, but it can be up to two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering mouth while coughing, maintaining distance from other people, monitoring and self-isolation by individuals who are suspected to have been infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by restricting, quarantining, restricting travel, controlling hazards in the workplace, and shutting down services.
This global partnership has led to severe socio-economic disruption globally. Sports, religious, political and cultural events have been postponed or cancelled, and supplies have been severely disrupted and have gone through panic buying.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are either nationwide or locally closed, and this has affected nearly 99.4% of the global student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of fear or hatred and discrimination against Chinese people, other East and Southeastern races and people in areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to the decline in travel and closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported cases of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on December 31, 2019, and investigations began in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were related to the wholesale market of seafood in Hunan, and therefore the origin of the virus is believed to be animal.
The virus that has caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that has a close relationship with the coronavirus of bats, the coronavirus associated with maize cats, and the SARS-CoV. The person who showed symptoms was not directly infected after 1 December 2019.
Two-thirds of the early cases reported in 2019 were found to be related to the market.
An unconfirmed report by South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 suggested that the first case of a 55-year-old man in Hubei province who was tracked until 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that as the number of new cases in China declined but suddenly increased in Italy and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China was higher than in China for the first time.
Cases may have been reported in a much smaller form, especially in cases where mild symptoms have been observed.
By February 26, young people had relatively low cases, with 19 or under age cases accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. According to Patrick Vallance, chief medical adviser to the United Kingdom, 60% of the British population needs to be infected before receiving mass immunity.
The reference to cases is about the number of people tested for COVID-19 and people who have tested positive as per the official rules.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and official policies of many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland were such that people with mild symptoms should not be tested.
According to a study published on March 16, about 86% of people who were infected with COVID-19 were not found in China until January 23, and 79% of undocumented people who were infected were infected with the virus.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 was estimated at 1.4 to 2.4.
According to a study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it could be 5.7.
The vast majority of people who have been infected with COVID-19 are recovering.
And for those who do not have symptoms, the period from the appearance of symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days, and most commonly 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, nearly 97,000 people have died due to COVID-19.
As of February 5, 80% of the deaths in China were individuals over the age of 60, and 75% had pre-existing health problems, including heart disease and diabetes. The official figures for deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are usually related to those who may have tested positive for COVID according to official regulations.
In fact, deaths caused by COVID-19 can be much higher, as they may not include people who are not being tested, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
In Italy, the death toll from COVID-19 is 4-5 times higher than the official death toll.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that “we know that this is a low-carriage estimate”, a statement that confirms the incomplete reports of a decrease in counting in U.S. deaths that occurred frequently in the pandemic, as was the first confirmed case with the H1N1 swine flu of 2009.
The first death outside China's mainland took place in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside China's mainland, more than a dozen deaths were reported each in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
All other continents except Antarctica had deaths reported in more than forty countries and territories as of March 13. Several methods are commonly used to record the number of deaths.
These figures vary depending on the region and time and the number of tests conducted on it, the quality of healthcare system, the choice of treatment, the time from the outbreak and the characteristics of the population; for example, the ratio of age, sex and overall health to the number of deaths reported in a given period.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the world's fatality rate as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
This number varies by region.
The proportion of deaths in China decreased from 17.3% (about those with symptoms from 1st January 2020 to 10th January 2020) to 0.7% (about those with symptoms after 1st February 2020). Other methods include Case Fatality Rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of those who have died (reported and unreported) from the disease.
These figures do not have a time bound and they track a particular population until the infection is resolved.
Many educational institutions have tried to calculate these figures for a certain population.
Based on evidence from the University of Oxford, the Centers of Medicine has estimated that the overall infection rate of the global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top-of-the-line estimate in this category is consistent with the first randomized COVID-19 tests in Germany and a statistical study that analyses the impact of the tests on CFR.
The WHO is confident that this can be brought under global control.
The peak and maximum duration of this outbreak are uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
Maci<0xC3><0xA8>s Boni, of Penn State University, states, "If not examined, the outbreak of infection stops coming to a level and it decreases as the host available to the disease decreases."
It is impossible to predict when this will happen."
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, has argued that "it will end by June" if all countries start to follow WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharsky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV2 is likely to spread over a period of one to two years."
According to a study led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, physical distancing and other measures will be "necessary until 18 months or longer are available."
William Shafner of Vanderbilt University stated that "it is impossible to destroy the whole because the virus is so easily infected," so "it will cause seasonal disease and most likely return every year."
The toxicity or severity of the return depends on the extent of collective immunity and change.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are not comparatively specific and do not occur in infected people.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Some of the less common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, shortness of breath, lack of sense of smell, drowsiness, coughing, sore throat, headache, cold sores, vomiting, vomiting, hemorrhage, diarrhoea or lack of life. WHO recommends that one of the symptoms is severe.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed emergency symptoms; e.g. respiratory distress, prolonged chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty getting up, and loss of face or lips; it is advisable to seek immediate medical treatment if such symptoms are accompanied by severe pneumonia, acute symptoms of respiratory distress, fall in the wound, septock and death.
Since some of those infected may not have symptoms, no medical symptoms, but test results may confirm infection, the researchers recommend that those who have come in close contact with those who are sure of infection should be closely monitored and tested to rule out the possibility of infection.
Chinese people estimate that the ratio of those who do not have symptoms may be slightly to 44%.
In general, the time of the onset of the actual disease (time from infection to symptoms) when the virus enters the body is one to 14 days, it is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the number of people who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and then dropped to 15%.
Some details on how the disease spread are still being ascertained.
The disease is mainly thought to be spreading within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) due to close contact and small drops caused by coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
During the study, it was found that drops can travel from 4.5 meters (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some have speculated that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that can stay in the air for a long time. Even if the virus is not produced in the air, respiratory drops can be created by breathing.
These drops can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby, or they can be pulled into the lungs with breathing.
Medical procedures such as intubation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation can cause respiratory secretions to spread through the air.
If a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth, it can spread.
Although he is concerned that he may spread through leprosy, he is believed to have low risk.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 either through intestinal or oral. Although the chances of spreading to the next stage of the disease are likely to be highest in the first three days after symptoms appear.
People have tested positive three days before symptoms appear, and this indicates that infection is possible even before a large number of symptoms appear.
While there are only a few reports of unexplained symptoms but confirmed cases in the laboratory, some countries have discovered that the infection has occurred in the absence of symptoms while searching for contact.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Continental has stated that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person infects another two to three people. The virus lives on the surface for a few hours to a few days.
In particular, the virus can be found on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
However, this can vary depending on humidity and temperature. COVID-19 tests for pets and other animals have come positive.
Although British officials advise to wash hands after contact with other surfaces that are likely to be touched by infected individuals, there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans.
Severe acute respiratory corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an unprecedented virus that was first isolated from three individuals with pneumonia in Wuhan with a group of cases of acute respiratory disease.
All the features of Novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all the related coronaviruses that are in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies as domestic soap dissolves its protective shield. SARS-CoV-2 is originally closely related to SARS-CoV.
Its origin is believed to be animal.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus makes a genetic group with genus genus betacoronavirus, along with subgenus serbicovirus (line B) with two bats.
Its entire genome level is 96% relative to other coronavirus-related samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid difference between the yeast virus and some parts of the genome sequencing between human viruses.
Today, the entire genome compared to the entire genome has been found to contain 92% of the genome content shared in the virus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the whalers are the same intermediary host.
A provisional diagnosis of the virus may be made based on symptoms, but it was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging.
Comparative studies of PCR and CT conducted in Wuhan suggest that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, and many of its imaging features are compatible with other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used or used as a first test to diagnose COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a number of rules for RNA testing using SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done either on the respiratory tract or on the blood sample.
The results can be available within a few hours.
Usually, this test is carried out with a sample of the secretion of the upper part of the nose, but it can also be used. Many labs and companies are developing blood resistant detection tests.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these tests were accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A blood test developed by Selexin in the U.S. has only been approved for urgent use by standardized laboratories.
Specific image characteristics above radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who do not show symptoms include unproven peripheral ground glass opacity and do not have pleural fusion.
International online information on the findings of the imagery of confirmed cases is being compiled by the Italian Radiological Society.
It's less accurate to use imaging to detect COVID-19 without PCR confirmation because of the combination with an infection such as adenovirus.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to a PCR and showed that imaging is faster and more sensitive, even though less accurate, to detect infections and suggested that it should be used as a means of testing in areas that have spread the disease.
Convolutional neural networks with artificial intelligence based radiographs and CT have been developed to detect the image characteristics of the virus.
Plans to prevent this disease include maintaining overall personal health, washing hands, avoiding touching the nose or mouth, using a tissue while coughing or sneezing, and putting tissue directly into the trash.
Those who have already been infected have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public places.
Measures to maintain physical distancing to prevent infection are also recommended. Many governments have restricted or advised not to travel to other areas from where the outbreak has occurred.
The virus has spread to many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the society and some sections of the society do not know when and where they got infected. It is recommended that people who provide healthcare care for an infected person be taken care of by standards, care in case of contact and eye care. Tracking the persons who have come in contact is important for the health authorities to detect the origin of the infection and prevent further infection.
The use of information about the location by mobile phones by the governments has led to concern about private life and has been issued by Amnesty International and 100 other institutions for restricting such practices.
Many mobile apps have been implemented or suggested for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, a group of more than a dozen experts were working on options such as using Bluetooth to log in to other cellphones, which preserve the user's privacy.
Then a message comes to users if they come in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misunderstandings about preventing infection are spreading, for example, cleaning the nose and rubbing it is not effective.
While there is no vaccine available for COVID-19, many organizations are trying to develop the vaccine.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if their hands are dry, before eating and after coughing, coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus dies of domestic soap because the household soap breaks down its protective coating.
If water and soap are not available, the CDC further recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content.
The WHO recommends not to touch the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Many solutions such as 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine can eliminate surface contamination (the surface of stainless steel can be disinfected using only one minute disinfectant).
Other wines such as benzalkonium and chrohexidine are less effective.
The CDC has recommended that if there are suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a place like a casserole or a vault, all devices such as tablets, touch screens, remote control and ATM machines used by sick people in such areas should be disinfected.
Health institutions have recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a twisted elbow or tissue while coughing or sneezing and immediately dispose of the tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are likely to be infected, as the amount of drops that spread through the breath while wearing a mask, sneezing or coughing can be limited.
People have been asked to wear masks when and how to use them.
According to the University of Leeds virus scientist Stephen Griffin, wearing a mask is likely to reduce the tendency of people to put their hands on their face, which is a major source of infection if their hands are not healthy.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends wearing a mask only if healthy people are at risk, for example those who are taking care of people who are infected with COVID-19, admit that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their face with their hands.
Many countries have started encouraging people to wear masks.
The CDC recommends the use of an intravenous mask made of cloth in the U.S. The use of disposable medical masks is recommended by China especially for people who provide health care, especially when in close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or in a crowded place.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from wearing masks in public places or from covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a mask in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going to a grocery store.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks in public.
Since mid-March, Taiwan has been making 10 million masks every day, and passengers will be required to wear face masks in trains and intercity buses from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going out, and it is recommended to make a mask at home for those who cannot afford to buy a face mask.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Maintaining social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves measures to control infection which are aimed at minimizing the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, playgrounds, theatres or shopping centres.
People can practice social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, not touching while greeting and keeping physical distance from others.
Many governments have ordered or recommended social distancing in the areas where the outbreak has taken place.
U.S. government institutions and health departments reduced the maximum number of people coming together from 250 people (if the spread of COVID-19 is not known in that region) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned more than two people from gathering in public places. Adults and those who have medical restrictions in places with social outbreaks i.e. diseases such as diabetes, heart disorders, regimen disorders, high blood pressure and compromised immune systems are advised by the CDC to stay at home, since the WHO recommends the association of such individuals with the aim of “the prevention of severe disease and the increased risk of disorder.”
The use of the term “social distancing” had the effect of being completely isolated from each other in alternative ways rather than encouraging people to stay in touch with each other socially. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines during this global pandemic.
This includes recommendations for having sex with the person you live with and who has not been infected with the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who are suspected of being infected have recommended self-quarantine at home.
Health institutions have given proper instructions on how to self-isolate. Many governments have ordered or recommended that the entire population be quarantined in areas where the infection has occurred.
Self-isolation of the most severe forms of self-isolation has been suggested for those in high-risk groups.
Those who are likely to have come into contact with a COVID-19 infected person and who have recently travelled to a country or region with a widespread infection have been advised self-isolation for 14 days from the last date of contact.
Preventing or preventing the spread and preventing the spread are measures to control the outbreak.
Preventing the spread is done in the early stages of the outbreak and its purpose is to track, isolate those who have been infected, plan measures to control the infection, and immunize other populations so as not to spread the disease.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, steps are taken towards mitigating the disease: measures are taken to reduce the speed of the spread and measures are taken to reduce its impact on the health system and society.
Both measures can be combined to prevent the spread and reduce the spread.
To prevent the spread, more extreme measures have to be taken to reduce the number of basic reproductions from less than 1 to reverse the global pandemic. As part of the planning of infectious disease, try to reduce the severity of the spread, which is called flattening the spread graph.
They reduce the risk of stress on health care and give time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Among the preventive measures that can manage outbreaks, including hand hygiene, masking and self-isolation of face, school closures, restrictions on overcrowding, overcrowding on large gathering events, encouraging the community to approve such interventions, as well as social measures aimed at physical distancing, such as personal prevention.
Other countries have also adopted various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has begun conducting large-scale tests and isolates locally and has warned to be vigilant about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those who self-quarantine and penalised those who could not do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished for storing medical items. Simulating the United Kingdom and the United Nations poses major challenges in preventing the spread of the disease (reducing the spread of the pandemic, not stopping) and preventing (reversing the spread of the pandemic).
Favorable plans to reduce the spread of the disease can reduce the high demand for healthcare by 2/3 and lead to death but still cause thousands of deaths and put huge strain on health systems.
Preventing or suppressing the spread may be a priority but it needs to be maintained continuously (or until the vaccine is available, if it happens earlier), not if the infection spreads again after the measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to prevent or suppress the spread of the pandemic cause economic and social losses.
There are no specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them which includes testing the available drugs.
Taking cold medicines, drinking fluids and rest in medical stores can help reduce symptoms.
Respiratory treatment, fluid from the veins and the need to help breathe can be felt as intense.
The use of steroids can worsen the effects.
Research is being done to treat COVID-19 on many such compounds that have been previously approved to treat other viral diseases.
The WHO has also said that "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2.
The WHO has stated that capacity building and adapting health care for COVID-19 patients are the basic measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Divisional Office of the ECDC and WHO has issued guidelines to take the available resources for hospitals and primary health care to various levels including focus on laboratory services for COVID-19 tests, cancellation of alternative methods if possible, segregation of COVID-19 tested positive patients and training staff and enhancing immunity by increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are many theories as to where the first case (the so-called zero number patient) was found.
The first case of the novel coronavirus can be traced to Wuhan, Hubei, China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
Their relationship was mostly with the wholesale market of Hunan seafood, in which even living animals were to be sold, and one theory is that the virus came from similar animals or in other words it is the origin of the virus. A group of patients with pneumonia caused by unknown causes was found on December 27, and on it was treated by Dr. Zhang Jisian Hubei Province patients.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital had warned their colleagues about the SARS-Tatom coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenling, were alerted by the police to spread false rumours and another, mother Feenhee, was warned by her superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Commission then issued a notice to the public and informed the WHO.
Many cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, which began investigations in early January, doubling the number of cases every seven-and-a-half days in the early stages of the outbreak.
The virus spread to other regions of China in early January and mid-January 2020 due to the migration caused by the Chinese New Year and Wuhan being the main transportation hub or junction.
On January 20, China reported about 140 cases in a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The latter official data indicates that as of 20 January 2020, symptoms had already started to appear in 6174 people. As of 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy in terms of the world’s highest confirmed cases. As of 9 April 2020, 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.

On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin planned to send military equipment, special vehicles and other medical supplies to Italy.
Italy's La Stanpa newspaper, based on an unknown "high-level political source," said 80% of the aid material sent by Russia was useless or of little use to Italy.
The source alleged that Russia had carried out an offensive campaign of "political and diplomatic" persuasion.
Lombardy's President Atilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi de Maio have denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane to the United States for medical assistance.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Piskov said, "While offering assistance to U.S. co-operation, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical materials and goods accelerate, they will also repay the same if needed."

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has written a public letter to world leaders for help on March 14, 2020, stating that his country is struggling to cope with the outbreak as the United States does not have access to the international market because of its restrictions against them. The outbreak has prompted the United States to adopt social plans that are common to other wealthy countries, including the United States of America.
Political analysts speculated that this would have a negative impact on Donald Trump's re-election in the 2020 presidential election, and that Japan and South Korea's diplomatic relations were strained by the global association for the disease.

His Parliament in Hungary has voted to allow his Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule indefinitely, to dissolve parliament and elections, and to rule those who are believed to have spread misinformation about the virus and to address the crisis to the government.
The outbreak of the coronavirus has been blamed for a number of incidents, including the shortage of supplies, which are generated by the increased use of global outbreak-facing equipment, panicked purchases, and disruptions to factories and transportation.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned of a shortage of medicines and medical supplies due to increased demand from consumers and disruptions to suppliers.
Many areas witnessed panic and purchase, resulting in loss of food, paper used in toilets, and bottled water from the fruits of the shops, resulting in a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry has been warned of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Managing Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
As a result of this increased demand, prices have increased by twenty times of the usual price and the supply of medical goods has been delayed by four to six weeks.
This has also led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, and the WHO has warned that it will put health workers at risk.
Due to the global pandemic in Australia, Daegu shoppers have a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This action led to a breakdown of baby formula in some supermarkets and the Australian government subsequently banned it, despite high COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and parts of Wuhan, and even in high demand for upcoming food items, both parts survived a severe food shortage.
Measures against China and Italy's stockpiling and the illegal trade of essential goods have been successful, and so the severe shortage of food that was expected in Europe and North America has been avoided.
In northern Italy, agricultural production has not experienced much decline, but the prices can rise at the expense of industry representatives.
In Wuhan, the store was also temporarily closed, while Chinese authorities opened a stock of pork to cater to the population.
There are similar laws in Italy that require food producers to maintain food grains for such an emergency.

Central banks are reacting more quickly than they were in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected areas due to the closure of public places including tourist attractions due to the ban on travel and advised by governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantas, while British regional airline Flyby has been shut down.
The impact on the tourism industry has reached a level never seen before.
Many railway stations and passenger trains have been closed.
The pandemic came at the time of the Chinese New Year holiday.
Many of the large crowding events were canceled by national and local governments, including annual New Year celebrations, as well as private companies closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many solar New Year programs and tourist attractions were closed to prevent large numbers of people from coming together, including the Farbidan City in Beijing and the traditional temple shrines.
Authorities in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and regions have extended New Year's holidays until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to open until that date.
These areas represent 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infection response levels to the highest level and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and canceling New Year’s celebrations. The retail market sector has had a global impact and shops have declined or shops have been temporarily closed.
The number of retailers in Europe and Latin America has fallen by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, there has been a 50-60% decline.
This resulted in a 33-43% drop in buyers at Payi Hind shopping centre in February compared to March.
Shopping malls around the world have imposed more measures such as increased sanitation, thermal scanners to monitor the temperature of customers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations’ Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by this global companion led to a recession in Latin America of more than 14 to 22 million people in the United States if they were in a much higher poverty line than in the conditions in which this global partner is not.
When the pandemic hit its peak in Wuhan, China lost about 5 million jobs in January and February.
Nearly 300 million rural migrant workers in China are either stuck at home or in Hubei province. More than 10 million Americans lost their jobs in March 2020 and applied for government assistance.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates that the coronavirus outbreak in the United States could lead to 47 million jobs and the unemployment rate could go up to 32%. Nearly a million Indian migrant workers have lost their jobs since mid-March due to the lockdown in India. A survey by the Angus Reed Institute found that 44% of Canadian households had lost jobs.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment allowances, and one million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly five million companies in Germany have sent their workers to work on short-term work plans called government-funded Kurtsarabyte.
Germany's short-term compensation plan has been adopted by France and Britain.
The fine arts and cultural traditions of the presentation have profoundly affected these areas of the global pandemic and have affected institutions and individuals - both jobless and non-global - level.
Organizations in the field of art and culture made efforts to continue their campaign (public funding with many) which included providing opportunities to the society to experience cultural traditions, ensuring the safety of their employees in public places, and helping artists whenever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, seminaries, public places, and other cultural institutions around the world were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and presentations were canceled or postponed.
In response to this, there was intense effort to provide alternative services through the digital platform. One of the most rapidly closing forms of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other concerts and social events such as concerts, technical conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. Vatican announced that religious week observances in Rome that are in the last week of Lent’s Christian repentance season have been canceled.
Many bishops have asked older Christians to stay at home instead of coming to Sunday prayers, some churches have made church services available via radio, online live broadcasts or television, while some churches have the option of driving in worship.
While the territories under Roman Catholic bishopship of Rome were closing their churches and chapels and vacating without St. Peter's Square devotees, other religious institutions have also closed their services and restricted the gathering of people in churches, mosques, Synagogues, Deolays and Gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health canceled Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and closed after midnight, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims as well as residents from visiting places of worship in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused a massive disruption in the world's sports schedule since World War II.
Several important sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally due to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that "the schedule of events will be rescheduled after 2020, but it will be before the summer of 2021."
This has led to a significant increase in the number of new sign-ups on many online gambling sites. Many music groups have postponed or canceled concert tours, affecting the entertainment industry as well.
Many large theaters, such as Broadway, have postponed their experiments.
Some artists have found ways to continue to produce and share art on the Internet as an alternative to traditional real presentations, such as the actual presentation of concerts or the creation of web-based "festivals" for artists to present, distribute, and publish their work.
There are many online internet memes on the subject of coronavirus, many of which work to create and distract jokes in this environment of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, <0x58>inophobia, severe prejudices and hereditary tendencies have been observed against Chinese people and people from the region of East Asia as well as hotspots in Europe, America and other countries.
Many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific, have reported incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
In a February report (when most of the cases were still limited to China) the Chinese people have been receiving reports from different groups around the world expressing racial sentiment that they are entitled to an outbreak of the virus or that they are receiving a fair change.
There has also been an increase in anti-China sentiments in some African countries.
Many citizens of Wuhan and Hubei, based on their regional origin, have reported discrimination.
Both online and offline, there is support for the Chinese people and the people in the affected areas.
Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19 after the outbreak spread to new hotspot countries, may have been subject to suspicion and xenophobia. People from other countries, including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, initially came together to join petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their countries as an effort to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, <0x23>ChianzDontCompany has also become a topic of much discussion on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asian people in England and the United States have reported increasing incidents of racism and attacks.
US President Donald Trump has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" and has been criticised by critics as racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked a bus carrying Ukrainian citizens and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from North East India, who come from the border areas of China and learn in important Indian cities, have experienced harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the state-level president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, made the statement that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took revenge for them."
The Chinese embassy in Kolkata later condemned the statement, calling it "flawful." <0x58>enophobia and dynasties have been fueled by companionships against non-Chinese residents in China, where foreigners are described as "foreign waste" and targeted to "dispose."
Newspapers with paywalls have removed some or all paywalls for their coronavirus-related news.
Many scientific publications have made available free of charge by doing scientific research on outbreaks.
Some scientists have chosen a way to quickly share their effects on preprint servers such as BioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods of detecting the presence of the virus and antiviral detection in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the test is ensured by the RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is also used to ensure a recent or active infection.
Antibiotic screening can be used for both diagnosis and close monitoring of population.
Antibiotic tests show how many people have the disease, including people with very minor symptoms or people with no symptoms to mention.
The results of this test can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of immunity of the group in the population.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable information about the spread of the virus in their population.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a huge difference in the number of tests conducted between the countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is also likely to be largely unrealistic in some countries.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) can be tested on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab or thumbnails sample.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test is only effective in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear from the throat and its number in the lungs continues to increase rapidly.
When testing infected individuals in the second week, a sample can be taken through a deep airway through a suction catheter as an option, or an after-throw component (thickness) can be used.
In January 2020, one of the earliest PCR tests was developed at Charity in Berlin in which real-time reverse transcription polymer chain reaction (RRT-PCR) was used and was a cornerstone of the 250,000 test sets made available for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England also developed the test until January 23, 2020. On January 28, 2020, South Korean company CogeneBiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection set (PowerCheck coronavirus).
This test detects an RdRP gene specific to the "E" gene and SARS-CoV-2 shared by all beta-CoVs. The 2019 SARS-CoV variant of SARS-CoV-2 detected in China was one of the first to be approved for emergency use by the National Medical Products Administration of China (BGI Group) and was one of the first to contain the disease in the United States.
One in three of the older versions of test sets led to inconclusive results due to faulty regeneratives and hampered tests at the CDC in Atlanta; the result was that on an average less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, tests conducted using two components were not considered to be reliable, and till then state-level and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization. Professional labs in the US began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, Lab Corp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR across the country.
Similarly, on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made available COVID-19 tests across the country.
There were no restrictions on the quantity; the sample collection and processing should have been done according to the CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test was developed and developed by the State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology in Russia.
The test was registered by the Federal Service on 11 February 2020 to monitor health care. On 12 March 2020, a test was developed by the Mayo Clinic for detecting COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a large-scale test that could be done in 3.5 hours, thus allowing a machine to conduct approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to the Abbott Laboratory to test the Abot's M2000 system; the FDA had previously given such authorization to the Holologic, Labcorp and Thermo Fisher Cystific.
On March 21, 2020, Safed received the EUA for testing in approximately 45 minutes from the FDA.
The FDA approved such a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid application technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can give a definite result in as little as five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
At present, there are approximately 18,000 such machines in the US and Abbott is expected to increase production to 50,000 tests a day. The monoclonal antibiotic test that will specifically bind the novel coronavirus nucleocapside protein (N protein) is expected to be developed in Taiwan. The test is expected to be carried out in 15 minutes to 20 minutes.
In a March 2020 review of information, it was concluded that "the chest <0x58>-rays are less useful to diagnose in the early stages, while CT [computed tomography] findings may be present before symptoms begin."
Typical features of the CT include secondary heterogeneous lateral distribution with bilateral multilobar ground-glass opasification.
As the disease progresses, subplural domains, crevice paving and consolidation develop.
Comparative studies of PCR and CT in Wuhan at the origin of the present pandemic suggest that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, despite being less characteristic as it incorporates other pneumonia and disease processes with its many imaging features.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "sit should not be used as a first-hand test to check or diagnose COVID-19." The CDC recommends PCR for early screening by March 2020.
Antibiotics, including IGM and IGG, were produced as part of the immune response to the infection.
The tests can be used to detect infection approximately 7 days after the onset of symptoms or for a period of time, to determine the immune system and monitor the population. Tests can be done at the Central Laboratory (CLT) or by Point of Care Testing (POCT).
Many clinical laboratories will be able to test a large number of automated systems that are manufactured within a certain period of time, but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
Although many samples can be used to track an immune response, a single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT.
For POCT, a single sample of blood is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR methods, there is no need for extraction prior to inspection. On 26 March 2020, the FDA disclosed the names of 29 factors who gave instructions to the agency as needed and therefore they are able to deliver their antibiotic tests.
The FDA has approved only one test under emergency use authorization as of 7 April 2020. At the end of March 2020, Euroimun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitom Diagnostics received approval from the European Community for their testing sets, through which IGG and IGA antibiotics can be detected in the background of the blood sample virus.
The test capacity is something that hundreds of samples can be tested in a few hours and therefore the test is several times faster than the traditional PCR test of the virus RNA.
It is usually possible to detect an antibiotic within 14 days after infection has spread. In early April, England found no set of antibiotic tests they had purchased were sufficiently appropriate to use.
Hong Kong has devised a plan that, in which suspected patients can stay at home, “the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube”, they spit in it, send it back to the patient in the emergency room, and in some cases they get the result of the test of the patient’s need to be tested in the emergency. The British NHS has indicated that they are not conducting an initial study of the plan to test the suspected persons at home, through which they come to the hospital.
Drive through centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive tests than any other country. On March 2 in Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians asserted that they had the capacity to carry out approximately 12,000 tests per day in the revolving system and had tested 10.700 people in the previous week.
When a doctor asks for a test, the cost is paid by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct a total of 1,60,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, drive-in tests were offered in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
The first survey in the laboratory found that a total of 4,83,295 samples were tested as of the 12/2020 calendar week and a total of 4,295 samples with 12/2020 were detected in the trial, with a total of 33,491 samples being tested in the month of February. In addition, only 5,491 samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all researchers at the hospital in Israel tested 64 cases simultaneously.
The construction was carried out within 5 days under the supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian and this modeling has shown that if the testing capacity had not started on time, Hubei would have seen 47% more cases and the corresponding cost of handling quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan laboratory has been followed quickly by Huo-Yan labs in 12 cities in China such as Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai.
As on 4th March 2020, there were 50,000 tests per day. This multiplex design, open source published by Origami Aceze, can test samples of up to 1122 patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without robotic liquid handlers.
As of March, the crackdown and inadequacies in the UK, the EU and the US have been a hindrance to large-scale testing.
As a result, some authors began experimenting with sample preparation protocols that included heating the sample to 98<0xC2><0xB0>C (208<0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to free the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing for more coronaviruses in its population than any other country, and reaching a large number of tests.
This was due to the combination of drive through capacity and purchase of wholesale throughput laboratories from Group 42 and BGI in proportion to the population (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency research labs in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to have such a large-scale operational outside China.
In China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States, various testing activities targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) accepted Germany’s action to send a production set to low-income countries with no resources to build their own set.
Germany's action was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, which delayed the available tests in the U.S.. China and the U.S. had problems with the reliability of test sets in the early days of the outbreak, and it could not provide enough sets to meet the test recommendations from countries and Australia, demand and health experts.
In contrast, a large number of tests are available in South Korea, which helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has developed a large number of private lab testing capabilities over the years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) ordered the expansion of testing programmes as the best way to reduce the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. The massive spread of the virus led to the backlash of hundreds of tests in private labs in the United States and the shortage of swabs and chemical agents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The test set developed by the CDC in the U.S. was “flawed”; then the government removed bureaucracy barriers preventing private testing. Spain purchased the test set from a Chinese company, Shenzhen Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but its results were found to be incorrect.
The company clarified that there may have been wrong results due to failure to collect the samples or use the set properly.
The Spanish ministry said it would return the wrong results set and instead give a different test set supplied by Shenzhen Bioiji. 80% of the test sets purchased by the Czech Republic from China were wrong. Slovakia purchased 1.2 lakh test sets from China which were found to be defective.
The set suggested by Prime Minister Matovic should be put in Danube. Attaches Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the batches purchased by Turkey from China were "large in number" and that they were "not used". The UK purchased 35 million test sets from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not usable.
The test, followed by isolation of patients who tested positive and tracking of those who came in contact with SARS-CoV-2, has yielded good results.
In Italy, where the first death from COVID-19 occurred, researchers working in the city of Italy conducted two rounds of tests on an estimated population of about 3,400, with a gap of about ten days.
Nearly half of those who tested positive had no symptoms and were isolated.
Due to limited travel in social life, the new infection completely stopped.
With aggressive tracking of contacts, restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, the spread of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has become much slower than in other developed countries and there have been no end-to-end restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events have been canceled and Singapore began advising citizens to stay at home from March 28, but schools reopened on March 23, at a time set for the holiday period.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have managed the pandemic through aggressive tracking, restricting domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have found that the mortality rate is much lower in countries that have conducted higher tests than the death toll, due to the fact that most of these countries have been able to detect only mild or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that countries which do not have the testing capacity and national laboratories have limited experience in COVID-19 should send their first five positive and first ten negative samples to one of the 16 laboratories referred to by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Out of the 16 labs referred to, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The country's testing policy has an impact on the ranking of "% positive of tests" in the following table.
While other factors are similar, symptoms have not been seen or are not seen, compared to a country that tests all citizens, the country that tests only those who are hospitalized will be more positive.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand washing, is the act of washing one's hands for the purpose of removing soil, lubrication, microorganisms or other unwanted components.
In some "severe moments" of the day, frequent hand washing prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and plaques, which affect the spread of my hands to the mouth.
Respiratory diseases such as influenza or colds can also infect people, for example, if they have not washed their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous skin).
The five most important times of the day when hand washing with soap is important are: before and after washing the baby's skin or after longitudinal changes, before and after the baby is fed, before and after cooking food or before or after handling raw meat, fish or poultry birds.
If there is no water and soap available, hand washing can be done with a hand-washing, the World Health Organization recommends washing hands at the following times:
Before, during, and after cooking.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After a long period of time or after the baby has been washed.
After coughing, coughing or sneezing.
after touching an animal, animal, or animal.
Medical hand hygiene is a habit of hygiene related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical care will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands from pathogenic components (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is particularly important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but is also an important habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, corona virus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
This includes lowering the rate of child mortality in the home.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing methods can lead to minor improvements in the height of children under five.
In developing countries, childhood mortality associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by initiating simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
With this simple action, the mortality rate of these diseases can be reduced by about 50%.
Interventions that stimulate hand washing can reduce diarrhoea incidence by approximately one-third and can be compared to supplying clean water to a low income segment.
A 48% reduction in diarrhoea incidence may be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing is the only very effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ARI) by engaging handwashing in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is a leading cause of death in children under five, causing an estimated 18 million deaths each year.
An estimated 35 million children die of diarrhea and pneumonia each year.
According to UNICEF, soap can save more lives by wearing a hand-washing habit before eating and after going to the toilet, rather than any vaccine or medical intervention, leading to almost half of the deaths caused by diarrhea and one-fourth of the deaths caused by acute respiratory infections.
Washing hands is usually combined with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (wash) programs.
Hand washing also protects against the effects of direct contact with firepitica, i.e. impetigo.
The minor harmful effect of hand washing is that continuous hand washing can cause skin damage by drying the skin.
A study conducted in Denmark in 2012 found that too much hand washing can lead to skin conditions such as eating hands, getting rid of her pores, which are called hand sibs or dermatitis, which is commonly found in health care workers.
Hand washing too often is also considered a symptom of ideologue-action compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times during the day when it is important for me to wash my hands with soap to reduce the spread of the disease by going to the bathroom (long, defecating), after cleaning the baby's skin (after long change), before feeding the baby, before eating and/or after cooking food, fish or poultry.
Other occasions include when proper hand washing techniques should be adopted to prevent the spread of the disease, before and after treatment for cuts or other injuries; after sneezing, coughing or nasal sneezing; after touching an animal's feces or after touching an animal and touching the waste.
In many countries, hand washing is low.
A 2015 study in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that the highest hand washing rate in Saudi Arabia is 95 percent for handwashing, about 77 percent for children in the United States, and the lowest for children in China is 23%. Some changes in behaviour are now showing severe handwashing.
The "necessary health care program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of measures of action for the advancement of children's health and education.
Destroying the pest twice a year, washing hands with soap daily, brushing the teeth with fluoride is an essential part of the national program.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by the use of soap or detergents with water.
The main activity of soaps and detergents is to reduce the inhibition of the solution and increase the viscosity.
Only water is insufficient to clean the skin because fats and proteins that contain organic soil elements do not dissolve in water immediately.
However, purification is done by proper flow of water.
Due to the nature of our reuse, there is a possibility that bacteria may be present in solid soap due to previous use.
Some studies on the migration of bacteria through contagious solid soap concluded that their migration was not possible due to the destruction of bacteria from the face.
The CDC still says “Fluid soap that is not touched by hand for use is creditable”.
Antibiotic soap has been promoted in the public for health awareness.
To date, there is no evidence of the use of an antiseptic or disinfectant recommended for antibiotic resistance in nature.
However, antibiotic soaps contain common antibiotic components such as triclosan, which have a wide list of resistant strains of organisms.
Therefore, although antibiotic stress inhibitors have not been selected for sterile soaps, they may not be as effective as stated.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective agents, the refined formulations, like pH regulators, have a wide-ranging effect on the presence of acidic acid (acetic acid ascorbic acid, lactic acid) and a wide range of skin conditioners (corphed, vitamins, menthol, and other skin conditioners).
Hot water that is comfortable to wash hands is not enough to kill germs.
Inflammation of the body's temperature increases sharply (37 degrees C).
However, natural oils containing soil and germs are more effective than cold water from soap.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that warm water is not effective in reducing microorganism weight from the hands.
Hand sanitiser or hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene agent without a base of water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubber, antiseptic hand rubber or hand sanitizer) began to become popular.
Most of them are in face form to reduce the effect of isopropyl alcohol or alcohol adhesion with carbomers (acrylic acid polymers) such as carbomers (acrylic acid polymers) in gel form or in an oily liquid form such as glycerin, or easy to use and alcohol dryness.
Mild hydrogen-peroxide boosts antibiotic activity. At least 60 to 90 percent of alcohol in hand sanitizer is an effective disinfectant.
Alcohol rub sanitiser kills germs, multi-drug resistant germs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some germs (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, Vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and molds
The alcohol rubber sanitizer contains 70% alcohol and is effective at 99.97% on the hands in 30 seconds after applying it (compared to a 3.5 log reduction equivalent to 35 decibels) and 99.99% to 99.99% (4 to 5 log reductions) on the genitals after 1 minute of lifting. Some of the hand sanitizers are effective.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is completely ineffective against germs such as norovirus (or norwalk), which is the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A lot of hand antiseptic or alcohol rubber should be used to completely clean both hands.
The front and back of both hands and the space between all the fingers should be soaked for about 30 seconds until the fluid, face or gel is released.
Wash the fingers thoroughly, rub them both on the floor. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hand sanitizer be applied on the hands after washing when the hands are dirty.
The use of these agents is increasing on the basis of simple use and fast-moving micro-organisms; however, they should not act as a replacement for washing hands properly if soap and water are not available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based sanitizers can cause skin to dry, so add softening substances and/or moisturizer to the skin.
This formula can reduce or eliminate the effect of alcohol drying by adding glycerin and/or other skin softening substances.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitisers with emulators reduce skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antibiotic detergents.
Allergenic contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity to contact gallbladder syndrome, or alcohol, or substance present in hand rubs are rarely found.
The low tendency to induce skin diseases was to be more prone to inflammatory contact than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not clean the hands of organic materials, but only sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sanitizer is not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of pathogens because the pathogens remain on the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends on a very large number of factors and formulations, and has historically significantly surpassed alcohol and alcohol rabies.
Recently, the formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have shown continuous and stored antibiotic activity, unlike alcohol, where after repeated use performance has been shown to decrease, may be due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in the low-income group do not afford soap and they use ash and soil.
Ash and soil can be more effective than just water but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated by microorganisms, it will increase the spread of the disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, soil is also a pesticide because when soil comes into contact with water, an alkaline solution is formed.
The WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing techniques recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of the disease include the following stages:
Wash your hands with warm water or soapy water.
Running water is recommended because the standing basins can be contaminated, and it appeared that the water temperature did not make much difference.
Apply a lot of soap on your hands, on the back of your hands, in the fingers, under the nails and make a face.
Soap removes germs on the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands more regularly when used with soap than with just water to wash their hands.
Hold your hand for at least 20 seconds.
The peel causes abrasion, which leads to the removal of germs from the skin and more germs are removed as they take longer.
Wash your hands with running water.
Washing hands in the basin can lead to contamination.
Wash your hands with a clean cloth or let the air dry.
Wet and wet hands quickly become contaminated back. Fingers, wrists, fingers, and lower part of the nails are the most commonly used parts of hand washing.
Artificial nails and semi-permanent nail polishes can accommodate microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended so as not to dry the hands; dry skin can cause damage to the skin which can increase the risk of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made for hand washing facilities in places where tap water and/or soap are not available e.g. if necessary in a developing country, pour water with proper pores from the hong kong jerikan or hull and/or use ash. In the case of limited water supply options (such as schools or rural areas in the developing country), there are "approximate" options.
Tipi tap is a simple technique in which a can is hung with the help of a rope to pour a little water on the hand and soap and has a lever that can be moved on the foot.
Drying hands effectively is an essential part of the cleaning process, but there is little debate about the most effective type of drying in a public washroom.
The increasing amount of research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryer in many washrooms.
A study was conducted by Westminster University London in 2008 to compare the level of cleanliness offered by paper towels, hot air use hand dryers and modern jet-air hand dryers, and the European tissue symposium sponsored the study.
After washing hands with a hot air dryer, the number of bacteria on the fingertips increased by an average of 194% and the number of sediments increased by 254%.
The total number of bacteria on the fingers has increased by an average of 42% and the number of sediments has increased by 15% after the jet air dryer has dried up.
After washing hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the fingers decreased by an average of 76% and by 77% on the bottom. As a result of each type of drying method, scientists tested to check whether other washroom users and the washroom environment are likely to be contaminated.
The jet air dryer that blows out the air from the unit at a speed of 180 meters per second (650 km/h; 400mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms out of the hands and units and polluting the washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 meters in length.
Using a hot air dryer, microorganisms spread from the dryer to 0.25 meters.
Paper towels did not show any significant spread. A study conducted by TUV Product und Umwelt in 2005 evaluated different hand-wringing methods.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after drying the hands:
Many hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers have been compared with paper towels drying.
During the journey, hand washing wipes are an option to wash hands when soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis found it necessary to wash his medical hands after researching its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff, if they forget, to wash their hands.
A study found that their use reduced the number of infections.
Washing a medical hand is for at least 15 seconds, in which a large amount of soap and water or gel is to be used to face and wash every part of the hand.
Hands should be glued together.
If there is a gap in the nails, bristle brushes can be used to remove them.
It is important to wash your hands and wash your hands with clean handkerchiefs as germs can live in the water on your hands.
After drying, use paper towels to close the water (and to open the exit door if necessary)
This prevents the back of the hands from being contaminated.
In health care, the purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("organs") and to avoid their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine has reported that the lack of hand washing in many medical environments has remained at an unacceptable level, where doctors and nurses at large tend to forget to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, causing microorganisms to be infected.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple methods could reduce catheter-related blood flow by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet containing the ideal methods of hand-washing and hand-washing in the healthcare sector.
The guidelines on hand hygiene through the institute can also be found on their website for public comments.
Whitby and others had combined the relevant review.
If there is a need for regular maintenance, professional tools can measure and standardize hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has five minutes to wash hands:
When it comes to blood/blood pressure
Prior to the decentralization and
After taking care of the patient. If the soap contains antiseptic chemicals ("drug" or "microbial antiseptic" soap) the act of killing in the hand-washing fluid.
Before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are large may require such an act of killing, a tube that can be turned on and off without touching hands for surgical operation, chlorhexidine or iodine wash, disinfectant towels to wash hands after washing and other disinfectant brushes and clean hands for mowing.
All the ornaments should be removed.
For this procedure, it is usually necessary to wash the hands and wrists from the elbow to the elbow for 2-6 minutes.
It doesn't take much time (10 minutes).
When washing, water from the wrist to the elbow area should be avoided to go back to the hands.
When the hand-washing is complete, the hands are dried with sterile cloth and the surgical gown is mounted on the limb.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after taking care of the sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infection in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand washing is obtained from the first 20% washing and when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%, the benefit was slightly greater.
Washing hands with simple soap, when compared to antibacterial soap, has more than triple the rate of bacterial infection and spread of the disease. For 30 seconds each time, a comparison of hand washing with an alcoholic solution and hand washing with anti-bacterial soap was found to be 26% less effective than handwashing with antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than hand-washed alcohol-based liquids to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium from hard-boiled hands. Training staff on hand-washing in interventions to improve hand health in healthcare settings, including making hand-washing alcohol-based fluids more available and reminding employees in writing and writing.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in various healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered to be an inexpensive and necessary means to achieve good health and good nutrition as well.
But the lack of reliable supply of water, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has made it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behaviour.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there is a shortage of hand-washing taps near every private or public toilet.
However, lack of hand washing can also be a result of dieting habits rather than lack of soap or water.
The promotion of hand washing with soap and its award may affect policy decisions, create awareness about the benefits of hand washing and change the long-term behaviour of the population.
To implement it effectively, it requires monitoring and evaluation.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that social-based approaches to increase hand washing levels in LMICs are effective, while social marketing initiatives are less effective. An example that promotes hand washing in schools is the “three star approach” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, as well as other sanitation needs.
When the minimum standards are met, the school can go from one to three stars at the end.
Creating a place for hand washing may be a part of an initiative to encourage hand washing to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising initiative that seeks to change behaviour. UNICEF promoted the adoption of handwashing emoji as a result of the coronavirus pandemic in 2019-20.
Some studies have taken into account Daly's approach to avoiding the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries.
But, a review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more expensive than other interventions in water and sanitation.
For people in particularly vulnerable situations, such as recently delivered mothers or hospitalized soldiers - first recognized the importance of washing hands for human health by two leading individuals working on hand hygiene in the mid-19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, working in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "English founder of modern nursing."
At that time, most people believed that the disease was caused by the smell of myomas.
In 1980, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, as a result of foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections, actively encouraged hand washing as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and COVID-19 in 2020 have created awareness among many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, murals showing "appropriate hand washing techniques" in public toilets and office buildings and toilets on airplane floors were installed next to hand washing sinks.
Washing one's hands in some way is an expression of one's unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to share its complexities.
It originates from the Bible passage in Matthew where Pantius Pilate washes his hands about the decision to crucify Jesus, but in some English societies this sermon came with a more widespread use.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, her guilty conscience about the crimes committed by Lady Macbeth and the crimes committed by her husband has to be forced into an attempt to wash imaginary stains.
It has also been observed that people tend to wash their hands more often than others when they remember or contemplate immoral acts and tend to give more importance to hand washing equipment.
Also, after such concerns, those who are allowed to wash their hands are less likely to engage in other "cleanliness" compensatory actions such as volunteering.
Washing hands is said to be a part of the hand washing method, using water for washing hands, but not using soap, which is a part of the hand washing method, which includes Baha'i, Hindu, Tivilah of Judaism and Netilat, Lavabo of Christianity, and Wudu in Islam. Religions specifically prescribe hand washing for hand washing after certain actions.
Washing hands after going to the toilet in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam is mandatory.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands before and after every meal.
Control of workplace hazards caused by COVID-19
Control of workplace hazard caused by COVID-19 is an application of occupational safety and health practices to control the threat of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)
The proper control of hazard at the workplace depends on the workplace and the nature of work, which depends on the source of infection, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low infection risk activities have minimal professional contact with people and other partners, for which original infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home when they are sick, respiratory etiquette and regular hygiene and disinfection of the workplace.
Medium-infection risk activities include activities that require up-to-date or close contact with people who are not aware of or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but who may have been infected by ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as schools, dat population jurisdictions and some large retail outlets.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk controls for this group include maintaining air play with a high-capacity air-filter, use of sneak guards, and personal protective equipment available if a person is exposed to COVID-19.
OSHA considers health workers and mortuary employees who have come in contact with a known or suspected person of COVID-19 as high risk of exposure to a high infection, including those who are processing or collecting or handling samples of a known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Risk controls that are appropriate for these workers include negative pressure ventilation rooms and engineering controls such as personal safety equipment that are suitable for that particular task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have many effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, need to be supervised by others, or fear of possible infection.
What goods are in demand and how to get them can be changed by commercial patterns (such as buying or distributing or purchasing through drive-through services when there is less crowd.)
Finally, goods can be intercepted from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19. Preparatory and response plans for infectious diseases can be used for protective action.
Addresses a range of risk schemes related to various workplaces and work, including sources of infection, risk factors arising from domestic and social sectors and risk factors of each worker, such as old age or old medical conditions.
It also outlines the contingency plans for situations that may arise due to the necessary controls and outbreaks required to address those risks.
Preparation and response planning for infectious diseases may be subject to national or sub-national recommendations.
Targets for responding to an outbreak include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at risk of health complications, maintaining business continuity, and minimizing adverse effects on others in their supply chains.
Where there is a business, the severity of the disease affects the response received in the communities of the place.
There is a framework for hierarchy of risk controls widely used in occupational safety and health to determine a group according to the effectiveness of risk controls.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and ultimately personal safety equipment.
Engineering controls include separation of employees from work-related risks without depending on the behaviour of the worker and can be the cheapest way to implement it.
Administrative controls are changes in work policies or procedures that require the workman or employer to take action.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some infections.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risk posed to the worker, they should be fit according to use (e.g., respirators) and properly fitted, regularly inspected, maintained and changed as needed, and appropriately removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to prevent infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHO), low-infectious activities have minimal professional contact with the public and other partners.
It is recommended to adopt basic infection prevention measures for all types of workplaces, including washing hands on top and fully, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, adhering to respiratory etiquettes including covering their mouth while coughing and sneezing, making available tissue paper and buckets of garbage, and preparing to use equipment from telecommunication or different shifts if necessary, among others.
Immediate identification and quarantine of potential infected persons is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others at the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who experience severe respiratory disease, who have not had a fever for at least 24 hours without any other medications that reduce their fever or change their symptoms, have to stay at home unless they have symptoms and other symptoms.
According to OSHA, moderate infection risk actions include jobs for which such people are not known or suspected to have been infected with COVID-19, but due to the ongoing community transmission around the business sector or recent international travel to places where the person has been exposed to COVID-19. (I may have had close contact with SARS-CoV-2 from six feet.)
It consists of workers who have come in contact with the general public, such as schools, trained personnel who are equipped with the skills needed to cope with the acute population, and who are equipped with the necessary personnel to deal with the COVID-19 needs, including personnel who are trained in the field of personal care, who are trained in the field of personal care, and who are

Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include keeping that person at a distance of 6 feet from other people, appointing a crew member to serve that sick person, and giving a face mask to the sick person, or asking the person to wear a tissue paper covering his mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing.
While serving a sick passenger or touching his physical fluid or potentially infected surfaces, it is necessary to wear a disposable medical glove and if the sick passenger has fever, persistent coughing or difficulty breathing, then the cabin crew must wear additional personal protective equipment.
Disposal of gloves and other disposable items in a biodegradable bag and then clean and disinfect infected spaces. For commercial vessels, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls, delay travel when sick and include self-isolation and medical center onboard if there is a fever or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be done in the room of a person who has been quarantined. The CDC recommends a temporary closure for sanitation and disinfection, whether or not an infected person is found in a school and child care centre.
Where there is minimal to moderate community spread, social distancing policies can be adopted, such as field trips, gatherings and postponement of other large gatherings, including physical education or food in prayer classes or restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, changing the time of arrivals and departures, limiting unnecessary visitors, and setting up separate health centres for children with flu-like symptoms.
While there is significant infection in the local group, with social distancing strategies, schools may be considered to be closed for longer periods of time. The CDC considers that the immediate risk of health is low for employees who are enforcing the law on a regular day-to-day basis.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact other persons who have been infected with COVID-19 or are susceptible to infection are recommended to follow the guidelines along with appropriate personal protective equipment, like emergency medical techniques.
If approached closely during the period of care, employees should clean and disinfect using household cleaning sprays or wipes before reusing their duty belts and gears, and follow standard procedures for disposing of PPEs used as well as for disposal, keeping clothes separate and washing.
OSHA believes that some of the health care workers and some of the bodybuilders are at high or high risk of infection.
High-infectious tasks include healthcare delivery, assistance, laboratory and medical transport staff who come in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
On known or suspected COVID-19 patients, if employees are performing aerosol-manufacturing procedures or are collecting or handling samples from such patients, they are at high risk of infection.
Aerosol-manufacturing procedures include intubation, cuff induction process, bronchoscopies, some dental systems, and examination or aggressive sample collection.
Hospital work at high risk of infection includes staff engaged in the preparation of bodies of persons with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of death; if they perform post-mortem, they are at high risk of infection. These risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including those undergoing the aerosol manufacturing process in additional engineering controls.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and toilet structures.
Samples must be handled with biosafety level 3 procedures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that in case of suspected cases of COVID-19, they should be isolated in an independent waiting room. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends that employees working within 6 feet of known or suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 be allowed to use aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-accredited N95 respirators or better respirators should be used in the context of an inclusive, written respiratory protector system, including fitness-testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory protectors can provide better protection and can be more comfortable for employees. WHO does not recommend protecting the entire body, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, it does not spread through other parts of the body.
The WHO recommends only surgical masks to be used by people who are scrutinizing the entrance.
WHO recommends using surgical masks, goggles or face coverings, goggles and gloves for those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples of patients undergoing COVID-19 treatment without any aerosol-manufacturing procedures.
If the aerosol-manufacturing process is carried out, use N95 or FFP2 respirators instead of surgical masks.
As the global supply of PPE is insufficient, physical barriers such as telemedicine, clean windows should be used, whereby the classrooms with COVID-19 patients are able to provide direct healthcare access to those who do not have the necessary PPE for specific work, recommends reducing the need for the use of PPE, and for those who need to monitor the use of PPE masks, use a single respiratory mask, without side-effecting the service of many patients who have been diagnosed.

We are in a very difficult situation this month.
COVID-19 is a global issue that explains our interconnectedness to the global humanity and our responsibilities to each other.
We don't have precedents for this challenge, but we know that our best response depends on global empathy, cooperation, and building a group with the heart of our organization.
The remarkable validation of how lucky we are to have the opportunity to work with wonderful people is the goodwill and care that all of our colleagues see through email, phone, and chat.
I can't be more grateful and proud of you for being my friend.
Last week, someone praised me for my work.
He reminded me of how important it is for the world to read Wikipedia right now and how powerful it is to have this important tool available online and for everyone.
This is possible because of your work whether you are updating this site or paying our co-workers or keeping your group safe.
The world of information that Wikipedia provides is now much more in need of than Eravi.
This is the moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it will also have a meaningful impact on the world.
In the coming weeks, we will start to see some significant changes in how we work together due to the importance of this campaign and your role in it.
Changes in our work schedules and schedules
The C-Team met last night to discuss its approach and schedule in the coming days and months, as Robin mentioned earlier.
In that conversation, we thought about what response would be appropriate to what we are facing and the best way to maintain the institution during this period.
We are looking forward to working together and helping our community for the long term.
If you want to change it again, you don't have to change it.
For all employees, contractors and contractual employees:
Our daily functioning will be expected to be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We're not announcing a holiday - if you can work more normal hours, you can use this campaign.
However, the world can't predict right now and you want to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries or go to a doctor, your health is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
We don’t need to say that, but we are saying it.
You don't need an illness leave or PTO - just tell your manager and help your team make changes to the schedule and schedule, so that you can take precautions to complete important parts of the work.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Brian at T&C Ops, so that T&C can support you and take precautions to get proper attention from the management of your situation.)
Full wages will be given to employees working hours.
We have already said and reaffirmed our commitment to our contractors and employees working hours.
Everyone will be paid according to his or her usual circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people use the work as a way to share the stress of the world around us.
Especially during this period you will get amazing benefits from what you do.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
Our demand is that you communicate with your managers, so that we know what to expect, and accordingly we can change.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we need to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Safety and Fundraising Teams (among others) do important work, which may require additional help.
We will start the process with all departments to evaluate the current targets and focus on helping the essentials for our mission.
There is a lot of work to do for all of us, we will focus only on the most important projects.
If you work slowly, there will be no loss.
We don't have a plan to "do double the work to complete the work."
You don't have to work extra hours to get the job done.
We accept that the situation has changed and, when appropriate, we will work to set new goals and schedules.
What's happening with the Annual Plan?
While adjusting to expectations about your new realistic and daily work time, our aim is to adjust the timeline for the delivery of your 2020-2021 annual planning.
Our aim is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which allows employees more time to prepare a budget to prioritise important tasks, self-care, and care for their loved ones, who need to work in the next few weeks or who want to work for a shorter period of time.
This extension of the time limit will greatly reduce the current planning workload and stress throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Board next week and as soon as we can confirm this, we will update our representatives and teams regarding further action.
Thank you to the community for your leadership.
Office Status, Infection and Sanitation
Last week, we found out that an employee in our SF-region is likely to have contracted the COVID-19 virus.
However, with extreme caution, we have appointed an anti-viral sanitation team to disinfect all areas in San Francisco's offices.
They use high-quality antiviral solution used in hospitals to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby and the shores of the carrier coming to our floor.
This building adopts its own precautionary measures by using such products that help in securing the safety of its tenants.
We are happy that these offices will be ready to work when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in the WeWork area, where they have been sharing their COVID-19 measures with us and with all other DC-area staff.
Last week, our DC office turned into a completely remote set-up in line with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC colleagues know, we are discussing renting a place in Brooklyn.
We’re talking about this, but we’re going to be able to talk about it.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Co-workers who have been working remotely for a long time know that this will be just an adjustment, and they would like to give you some suggestions:
Limit the duration of your meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need long sessions, think about how they can be divided into several days.
Explain the agenda of the meeting clearly and send it to them in advance.
Make this video a default by means of tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and connectivity.
To make each meeting easier, ask someone to lead her, who will keep an eye on the chat for the questions asked, and check the list of speakers and ask someone else to help take notes (or take notes in cooperation with each other).
Send an e-mail to the technical assistant if you need a headset.
Use your money to pay for the debt.
Join the <0x23>Remotes channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the task assigned.
The Human Resources Operations team is looking at 'Webinar-based Argonomyx' to help with the growth of the last work distributed throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to postpone a Wikimedia-subsidized mass event like "Editathons," until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We told them that we have come to know that our request for stay and other restrictions would make it impossible for them to fulfill their agreed grant-in-aid, and also stated that no one will be punished for this delay and for changing that goal.
Next week we will follow the additional guidance provided for Wikimedia and other regional and topical community gatherings.
A common feeling of the entire global community is both sad but at the same time pleasant on this clarity and the ability to focus on our own community, Wikimedia and others.
As we move forward, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space to the community to monitor this impact and track our communication with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19-related issues.
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time understanding each other.
We are here to help and support as much as possible.
In the meantime, continue to get information through this email and keep getting other important information about COVID-19 on office-wiki.
The CRT will keep the page updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees, who live in countries that are currently severely affected.
If you have any questions about travel, celebrations, a major workflow, or any of the challenges considered, or need help with anything else, don't hesitate to notify and work with CRT.
We are here to help and cooperate and establish contact if needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive content, please send an email to the Director-Breathe of Human Resources Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment and restriction of our work.
Instead, they have to give official recognition that our work and obligations at the moment will need to be adopted in a way that we have never done before.
These are the steps that, in our opinion, are necessary to cooperate with each other, so that we can continue to work, provide them with the needs and provide them with the services they depend on.
When the time comes, we will be able to help you.
This is the time to cooperate with each other and create space for important work, which will be faced in the coming weeks and months.
We need all of you to do this, so you need to take care of yourself and your family, so that you can give your best when you need it.

B'angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cells in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
By reducing the level of angiotensin-II and increasing the level of ang(1-7), ACE2 opposes the action of the ACE2 related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and therefore it is a safe drug for the treatment of heart and blood vessels. For some corona viruses, ACE2 serves as the entry point for cells to enter.
The human version of an enzyme is often called HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-based metaloanzyme that is present on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein consists of an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and C-terminal colectrine renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single pass type of mucous skin protein that is activated by the action of your enzyme on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extra muscle domain of ACE2 is dissolved from the second transmembrane called Sheddes, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually dissolved into the urine.
ACE2 is most commonly found in all organs: ACE2 is linked to the membranes of lung type II alveolar cells, entropy in small intestines, endothelial cells of arteries and heads, and to the smooth muscle of arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as resistance to ACE.
ACE angiotensin I allows the hormone to enter the vascoconextricating angiotensin II.
In turn, ACE2 releases carboxyl-terminal amino acids from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes them in vasodiolator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arog-Ile-Val).
[des-Arg9]-Bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and several other peptides, including gherlin, can cause ACE2.
Neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 also regulates the movement of the screen and is involved in heart disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point in cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (which causes SARS due to the virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19 due to the virus).
Notably, ACE2's enzymatic domain on the surface of cells has the effect of building up the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in endocytosis and the transfer of both viruses and enzymes into the endosoms located in the cells.
The admission process also requires the host serine protein TMPRSS2 to prime the S protein, which is currently being tested as a potential treatment. This has led some to conclude that reducing ACE2 levels in cells will help fight infection.
However, many professional organizations and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
In addition, patients who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure, reduced their risk when treated with ACE inhibitors.
Although the effects of ACE inhibitors are less strong than the overall risk of pneumonia, the use of ACE was also associated with reducing the mortality associated with pneumonia.
Recombinant Human ACE 2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and it has been shown to improve pulmonary hemo dynamics and oxygen saturation in pig's pills with lipolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and it takes 30 minutes to start and its effect is 24 hours.
Many findings show that raaceae2 can be a promising drug for people with intolerance to diseases with high positions of classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or imbalance angiotensin. Infused in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b-COVID-19 apps are software applications in mobile, designed to help people contact as a response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying a person (the "contact") who has been in contact with an infected person.
Numerous applications were developed and proposed with official government support in certain provinces and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks were developed to create contact tracing apps.
In particular, there has been concern about privacy in such systems that track the geographical location of the app users.
The use of a bluetooth signal to log in with other cell phones of the user is included in less involuntary options.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that such bluetooth-based apps will be integrated into functionality to support them directly in their Android and iOS operating systems.
The Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay in China, has provided an app that allows citizens to check whether they have come in contact with people affected by COVID-19.
This app is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called Trace tuger is used.
The app was developed by a local IT community and made available as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched a bluetooth-based app "Stop Corona" to contact potentially infected individuals and respond quickly to health care officials.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
The app is expected to be approved by Google Play Store and Apple App Store by April 14, 2020.
The app is in an advanced stage of development and will be available in a few weeks, the government said on April 12, 2020. A similar app is available in Ireland and in France ("Stop Covid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's Trace Tougheneder and Blue Tooth protocols. Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app designed to ensure that they do not leave home for patients infected with COVID-19 living in Moscow.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical difficulties in app-based systems, including the use of false positives and apps to reduce effectiveness if the population is limited to a very small extent.
While expressing concern about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their App Store, limiting it to "authorized" or otherwise reputable institutions.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed strong concern about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether infrastructure designed to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed or not.
Amnesty International and 100 other institutions have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The institutes announced eight conditions for government projects:
It must be "legal, necessary and certified."
The expansion of monitoring and monitoring will have to be Sunset Clauses;
The use of data is limited for COVID-19 reasons.
Information security and anonymity have to be secured and shown to be protected on the basis of proof;
Digital surveillance requires the prevention of severe discrimination and neglect;
The sharing of information with third parties should be defined in the Act;
The right of citizens to defend against misconduct and to respond to misconduct;
All "related stakeholders" with public health experts and neglected groups require meaningful participation. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporters Ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also issued checklists.
Once the need for a tracking system is met, the proposed Google/Apple scheme aims to address the problem of permanently removing it from their device operating system.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps in which the need to download the app removes both things from the ability to avoid tracking.
Network-based tracking has been approved in Israel.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to access personal location data; many privacy protected systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunization.
In South Korea, a system was used to present contact tracing that was not based on the app.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected a variety of tracking information, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and gathered potentially - infected individuals to create a notice through text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made the location information publicly available, due to far-reaching changes in the information privacy law following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through numerous apps and websites. Other countries, including Germany, considered both central and privacy-protected systems.
Details have not been released as of April 6, 2020.
Privacy - Protected Contact tracing is a well-established concept, with research materials from at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy -friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log in to other cell phones with the user's contacts.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinating effort that has both central and decentralized methods and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy – Proximity Finding (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Protocols, and other contact tracking mechanisms to mobiles (including CEN).
Personal data in these protocols never leave the device and all the matching is on the device.
The private group at the MIT Media Lab is developing SafePath, a platform for the use of privacy-protected techniques while collecting or using space or path gaps to track the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on the research of the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Another similar attempt is SafeTrace, a private technology developed by Enigma MPC company, which was originally set up in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace allows users to share sensitive location and health data to other users and authorities, without compromising the privacy of that data, using secure data hardware technology.
The Global TCN alliance was founded on 5 April 2020 by groups that had originally come together around the same approach and mainly covered protocols, and their aim is to reduce fragmentation, enable the efficiency of backing and alerting apps, which is the main aspect of wider adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol free of charge used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing based on Bluetooth low-energy technologies and combinations of privacy cryptography, which they claim will be kept confidential.
He also highlighted the features of the basic technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system can be implemented in three phases:
Role out of tools to enable governments to create government secrets - to protect coronavirus tracing apps.
The integration of this functionality directly into iOS, AndroidGoogle, and Apple is planned to address the problems of continuous monitoring by distributing the system through first operating system updates and removing the risk again in the same way after the breakup.
B. Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing, re-profiling, retasking, or therapeutic switching) means the use of a drug originally approved for one disease or for the treatment of another disease.
This is the same kind of scientific research that is currently being done to develop safe and qualitative treatments for COVID-19.
Plasma Infections for Vaccines and Recurrence. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 drugable proteins, each of which has many associated bonding positions.
The analysis of such a bonding position provides the right space for the creation of a qualitative antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include Papen-like proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicalase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Husain A.A. and others studied various condensed compounds followed by analysing the similarity of its form with the same approved drug so that in their preclinical study it could be recommended in the medical study plan by developing an anti-corrosive drug SARS-CoV-2.
Chloroquine is an anti-inflammatory drug that is used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that the four drugs that will be studied as part of a Solidarity clinical trial will contain chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that tests on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will be carried out from March 24 in the state of New York. On March 28, the FDA granted the authority to use hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The FDA's approval for these treatments has not been obtained through the clinical trial process and has been empowered under the EUA only for experimental treatment for patients who have been admitted to the hospital but are not able to receive treatment under the clinical trial.
"The use, quantity, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been certified," the CDC said.
Doctors have said that this medicine is used when there is "no other option left."
A small study was conducted by the Turkish research team in Istanbul, in which chloroquine is being used with zinc, a vitamin A, a vitamin D and a vitamin D.
A large number of studies are being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine is being tested by the NYU Longon Medical School as a preventive measure.
Favipirvir has been claimed to be "completely effective" from Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen.
If 35 patients tested negative in Shenzhen in 4 days, the duration of the disease of 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted on 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical company reminded the public that the current level of support for the drug is inadequate and primary.
On April 2, Germany announced it would buy the drug from Japan to store it, and distribute it to university hospitals with the help of the army, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.

A study on Lopinavir/Retonavir (Caletatra), in which a joint study of anti-virus Lopinavir and Ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits have been shown"
Medications were developed to prevent the formation of a replica of HIV by binding with proteins.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to find a compound that binds to the protein of SARS-CoV-2 by improving these drugs. The scientific field has been criticized for using the drug made with HIV/AIDS for a new purpose.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included Lopinavir/Retonavir in the Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences then discovered that Remdesivir showed intravenous antiviral action infilo-, pneumonia-, paramico-, and corona-virus.
One of the problems with antivirus treatment is the resistance to mutations that result in more serious diseases and infections.
According to some previous pre-tested studies, Remdesivir is likely to have high gene resistance to resistance. Some clinical trials are ongoing, with two trials being conducted at Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild illness and the other for people with severe illness.
Three clinical trials are under way to give life-saving treatment to patients with severe COVID-19 and hospitalised patients; two are controlled by placebo (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing azithromycin on March 24.

More than 6,000 adults with mild symptoms who are diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are 40 years of age or older are being recruited for a study called callcorona.
Pregnant or lactating mothers as well as women who do not follow the effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Various anti-inflammatory drugs are being tested in Italy.
Heparin is being used to treat patients with low molecular weight, which encourages medical institutions in Italy to publish guidelines.
On April 14, Italy announced a multi-disciplinary study on 300 patients to research the immunosuppressive and therapeutic quantities of anoxaparin sodium.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientifically more attention is being paid to the use of antiviral drugs that were previously approved in association with Mars, SARS, and West Nile virus for the new purpose.
According to the 7th edition of China's guidelines, Rebavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19.
Yumifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 as per the 7th edition of China's guidelines.
Some antibiotics were found to be usable for the new purpose of treatment on COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (IL-6-anti-receptor): approved by China
See also Tocilizumab <0x23>COVID19 trials in China and Italy.
The COVID-19 vaccine is an anti-coronavirus vaccine for 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no clinical trials of any vaccine have been completed, many efforts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said at the end of February 2020 that the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is not expected to be available before 18 months.

Many organizations are using the published genome to create a potential vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, CEPI initiatives to develop the vaccine are imperatives of speed, manufacturing capacity, scale planning and global reach.
In April, scientists from CEPI found that research and development were underway on 10 different technology platforms in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of Phase I safety studies are:
Nucleic Acids (DNA and RNA) (Physics I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate:Consino biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to CEPI scientists, in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the pre-development stage, of which 78 were confirmed to be under development (79 according to the Millennium Institute), and 37 others have been released and very little information has been made public (acknowledged to be planned or planned).
Phase I-II tests have conducted a preliminary examination of safety and immunity and are usually randomized, placebo controlled and carried out at multiple locations to determine the exact, qualitative quantity.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a controlled group, and the efficacy of the vaccine is checked to prevent the disease, as well as monitoring for side effects after adequate doses are given.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (as confirmed earlier as April 2020), 74 vaccines have not been evaluated in humans (still under “preclinical” research).

Some vaccines have adverse effects, which can also be called unintended consequences.
This means that in addition to preventing the disease, other benefits can also be derived from it.
A total of 4,170 healthcare workers will be recruited for a randomised trial in Australia.
The vaccine that is being developed is likely not safe or effective.
Previous research done to assess the efficacy of the vaccine on COVID-19 specific animals such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals and other primates, such as humans, suggests the need for biosafety-level 3 controller measures to handle live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on humans and on other animals.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine available for both safe and effective SARS for humans.

The post on social media has sparked a debate about carcinogens, according to which the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and the vaccine is already available.
The patents, which have emerged as evidence from various posts on social media, refer to genetic sequences and existing patents for vaccines, such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by Caviar Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Fatigue, fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, cough, sneezing, nausea and abdominal pain can be other symptoms.
The duration of symptoms is usually five days but can range from two to 14 days.
Most patients have mild symptoms, while some patients experience an increase in the disease resulting in sterilization of the viral pneumonia and multiple organs.
As on 17th April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, of which 153,000 died.
More than 5,68,000 patients have recovered from the disease. The virus spreads mainly through direct contact among people, often through coughing, sneezing or talking outbursts.
When breathing, these tissues are thrown out and fall to the ground or to the surface, they do not carry the infection far away.
People can also get infected by touching the eyes, nose and mouth by touching the contaminated surface.
The virus lives on any surface for 72 hours.
The first three days after the onset of symptoms are highly contagious, but the spread can also occur before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is a standard method of diagnosis.
Those who are suspected to have contracted the virus are advised to wear masks.
The general public is advised to wear masks, some officials are against wearing masks, while some are advised to use it and some say it is necessary to use it.
There is currently no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported six cases of the disease in most countries.
Patients suffering from the virus sometimes do not show symptoms or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Contingent symptoms include difficulty in breathing, constant pain or stress in the chest, feeling confused, difficulty walking, and nausea in the face and lips; it is advisable to go to the hospital immediately if these symptoms occur.
Mild symptoms may include respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal congestion, or coughing of the throat.
In some patients, the symptoms of angina appeared to be less severe, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Some patients in China initially experienced chest ache and heart ache.
Some patients have been diagnosed with pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but in some people it can be two to 14 days.
97.5% of patients who developed the symptoms showed up within 11.5 days after infection. Reports show that not all infected patients develop the symptoms.
The role of carriers who do not have these symptoms is not yet clear; however, they are said to be involved in the spread of the disease from the initial levels.
The number of infected patients who do not show symptoms is not yet known and is being studied, as well as 20% of the confirmed cases from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported no symptoms until they were hospitalized.
China's National Health Commission began incorporating non-symptomatic patients into daily cases from April 1; of the 166 cases that emerged on that day, 130 (78%) had no symptoms at the time of the test.
Both red and blue are very heavy.
It's easier to speak out than to speak normally.
According to a study conducted in Singapore, uncovering the mouth can lead to a distance of 4.5 metres (15 ft).
Although the virus does not originate from the air, the National Academy of Sciences has predicted a bio-aerosol transmission and has found a positive virus RNA in samples taken from gas collectors outside people's homes.
Some medical procedures, such as tapping the body and resuming the activity of the heart as well as the blood vessels, can fly through the respiratory tract and thus spread through the air.
When there is concern about its spread through viscera, the risk is considered to be low. People with symptoms are most likely to get infected with the virus; and so on.
According to The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, but two to three people can be infected by the virus. The virus lives on surfaces for hours to a few days.
The virus has been found on plastic and steel surfaces (AISI 304) for three days and on 99% copper surfaces for four hours.
However, it depends on the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere and varies accordingly.
If soaps and detergents are used properly, they can be effective for this; soap products degrade the thick protective layer of this virus, neutralize it as well as separate it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other measures, such as, benzaconium chloride and chloroquine gluconate (disinfected for a type of surgery) are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, samples of red were taken two days after being admitted to hospital.
Out of the six patients, the highest number of patients were found in the first sample and the sixth highest number of patients were found in the second day of the test.
Civil Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory symptoms coronavirus. It was first isolated from three patients with pneumonia associated with the Center for acute respiratory disease patients in Wuhan.
All the features of this new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronavirus related to it in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap that forms its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the virus, the origin of SARS-CoV.
The greatest impact caused by COVID-19 is on the lungs, as the virus reaches the original cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is rich in the second type of air cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called 'spice' to connect to ACE2 and enter the original cells.
In China, 12 per cent of patients admitted to hospitals in Wuhan, China, have also been diagnosed with severe heart disease and are frequently diagnosed with severe illness.
The symptoms of acute heart injury are widespread due to the inflammatory response of the body during the spread of the disease and the loss of immunity, but the acute injury of the heart muscle may also be related to the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are abundant in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
Blood clotting (31 percent) and blood clotting (25 percent) have been found to be widespread in severe COVID-19 patients. They are probably associated with unregulated pathogens. The autopsy of patients who died due to COVID-19 has found their lungs depleted (diure alveler damage) and also become inflamed in the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tendency to infect cells with respiratory medulla cells for ACE2, symptoms of hyperinflammation appear in severe COVID-19 patients.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-drug T-cells were found to be associated with the appointment of inflammatory IL-6-drug monocytes in COVID-19 patients and acute lung disease.
The intrusion of white cells has also been seen from the post-mortem.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a number of rules for testing the disease.
Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is an approved method of testing.
Respiratory samples obtained by sputum swabs are usually tested; but respiratory discharge or sputum samples can also be used for this.
The results of the test are usually available within a few hours or two days.
Blood tests can be done, but this requires two samples of blood done at a distance of two weeks, and the immediate value of its results is low.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the virus and publish its genetic sequences, enabling laboratories around the world to independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that identified the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibiotic tests (which can diagnose an ongoing infection and also tell if a person had previously contracted the infection) were developing, but were not widely used.
The accuracy of China's tests is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point of care test for use at the end of that month on March 21, 2020. The diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods of identifying infections based on chemical characteristics and disease risk.
Bilateral multilober ground-glass obscurity with periphery, asymptomatic and background distribution was common in the initial infection.
As the disease progresses, there may be subpolar domination, bizarre paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar fillings) and concentricity.
There is little information available about the physiology and micro-injuries of COVID-19.
Here are some important facts about the disease found in the post-mortem:
What can be seen by the eyes: pulmonary tremor, chest pain, pulmonary fibrosis, and swelling of the lungs
There are four types of pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: inflammation of the lungs, overgrowth of the lung cells, unrelated large cells in the lungs, interstitial inflammatory and multicellular large cells.
Acute pneumonia: pulmonary fibrosis and uncontrolled secretion of the lungs
Diffuse alveler dams are caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome) and a severe lack of oxygen.
Pneumonia: Uncontrolled secretion in the lungs and interstitial fibrosis in the lungs
Blood: Intramuscular decomposition of the arteries (deceminated intravascular coagulation); leukorythroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds, maintaining hygiene of the respiratory tract, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends wearing a handkerchief in front of the nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing. If there is no handkerchief, cover the nose with a corner of the hand.
It is recommended to wash your hands after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has suggested using cloth to cover the face while in public places to limit the spread of infection from people who do not show symptoms. The purpose of social distancing is to reduce contact with large gatherings of infected persons. For this reason, schools, offices have been closed, travel restrictions have been imposed and mass gatherings have been banned.
People are advised to keep a distance of at least 6 feet from each other.
While the vaccine is not expected to arrive as early as 2021, a key part of the management of COVID-19 is to control the disease, it is also known as "Flatting the Curve."
People should wash their hands frequently for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear to be damaged, before eating and after coughing or sneezing, the CDC recommends.
The CDC further recommends that hand sanitizer containing alcohol content, containing at least 60% alcohol, should be used only when soap and water are not available. The World Health Organization has provided two formulas for local production in areas where commercial hand sanitizer products are not available.
In these formulations, antibiotic activity is caused by ethanol or isopropane.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to prevent the growth of microorganisms in alcohol; it is “not a substance that is active in the liver.”
Glycerol has been included as a factor in maintaining humidity.
Supportive care is managed by patients, which includes oxygen supply, fluid treatment and support to other vital organs that have been affected.
CDC recommends wearing a simple face mask for those who are suspected to be carriers of the virus.
The treatment of oxygen from the outside has been used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits of it are still being noticed.
Individual hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet have been suggested to increase immunity.
Supportive treatments may be used in people with mild symptoms at an early stage of infection. The World Health Organization and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to take care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
In the United States, serious epidemiologists and pulmonologists have combined the recommendations of treatment from various agencies and given the IBCC under a single open source.
As of April 2020, there has been no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some medical professionals suggest using paracetamol initially instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of spreading the virus, especially during the process of creating body fluids, such as tapping or hand ventilation.
The CDC recommends keeping such patients in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) along with general precautions, contact care and airborne spread precautions for healthcare workers who are taking care of COVID-19 patients. The CDC also outlines guidelines for use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommendation of preventive equipment for grooming: PPE gowns, respirators or face masks, safety for the eyes and medical gloves. Respirators should be preferred instead of face masks if available.
N95 respirators are recognized for their industrial system, but the FDA has also approved the use of masks under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles like dust in the air but, in other uses, its effect cannot be guaranteed for a particular biological medium.
When masks are not available, they can also be used as a face covering or as a last resort as per the CDC's recommendations.
The vast majority of COVID-19 patients are not as serious as needing medical ventilation or some alternative, but a few percent of them are patients.
The type of medical respiration available to patients due to respiratory obstructions caused by COVID-19 is a constant study for people in the hospital. The process of tapping through the nose can be avoided by either the high-flowing duct or bioavailable positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether these two are equally beneficial for patients with severe illness.
Some doctors prefer aggressive mechanical ventilation treatments if available, as this technique restricts the spread of pathogens in the air, compared to inhaling excessive inhalation from the respirator. The incidence of the disease is much higher in older people (those over 60 years, especially those who are over 80 years of age).
In many developed countries, there are not enough hospital beds per capita, so if there is a sudden rise in the number of severe COVID-19 cases, it can limit the health system’s capacity to handle the issue of hospitalization.
According to a study in China, 5 per cent of the total patients were admitted to the ICU department, 2.3 per cent of the patients needed a technical basis for ventilation outside and 1.4 per cent died.
About 30% of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals in China had to be finally admitted to the ICU department.
Due to the rapid development of respiratory problems (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients, technical ventilation becomes more complicated and it becomes more and more difficult to deliver oxygen.
While supplying high oxygen to the ventilators and high PEEPs, which have a pressure control capacity, there is a need to reduce the risk of lung injury caused by the ventilator as well as the risk of pneumothorax.
High-capacity PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on possible treatments began in January, 2020 and many antiviral drugs are going through trials since then.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although it will take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs that have been tested have been approved for other uses or are going through further trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on critically ill patients.
Volunteers recommended by the World Health Organization participate in trials to study the impact and safety of these potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary approval to treat convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for patients whose lives are at risk.
They have not gone through chemical studies to determine if they are effective and safe treatments for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The monitoring information allows the app to show "close contact" and understand the potential for infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
The app suggests self-isolation if the potential risk is directed. Not only that, it also informs local health authorities. Big data analytics on cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are all used in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore to monitor infected patients and those who have come in contact with them.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security departments to verify the data of mobile phones of people who are likely to be infected with the coronavirus.
Measures were taken to impose quarantine and protect those who could come in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom handed over the phone's location to the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, which will be used to prevent the spread of the virus and for research.
Russia has set up a face recognition technology to detect people who break the quarantine.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Julio Galeria, said he was receiving information through mobile phones.
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 partners.
Estonia's President, Carthy Carlyleed, has called on the world to take concrete measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
People may find it difficult to quarantine, travel restrictions, reverse effects of treatment or fear of getting infected.
The BBC cited Rory O'Connor's statement as "a growing social isolation, loneliness, health care, stress, and economic degradation are the root causes of a threat to people's mental health and well-being."
These diseases may have little or no symptoms at all, with other respiratory illnesses such as colds and coughs.
If mild cases usually heal within two weeks, it can take three to six weeks for a serious illness to heal.
Based on information from other similar viruses such as SARS, MERS, it can be said that pregnant women who are severely infected with COVID-19 may be at greater risk, but there is no information available about COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs, which causes pneumonia.
People who are severely affected may develop COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Disorder Syndrome (ARDS), which can result in respiratory failure, septic shock or several organ failure, etc.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clots of blood and heart, kidney and liver damage, etc.
6% of people admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 have noticed an increase in blood clots, prothrombin periods, and 4% of those in these groups have found kidney function to be deformed.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes.
The same report states that the period between the appearance and death of the symptoms of the disease was ten days, of which 5 days were to be admitted to the hospital.
However, the patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit had to be admitted to the hospital and the time between their death was seven days.
Early case studies found that the period between death from the onset of symptoms of the disease was 14 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission (NHC), the male mortality rate was 2.8%, while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
Histopathological testing of the post-mortem lung sample shows diffusion alveolar decay along with cellular fibromyal oxide in both lungs.
There have been viral cytophatic changes in pneumocytes.
Acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) is associated with pulmonary artery disease.
11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission showed a high level of troponin or heart failure.
According to the US March report, 89% of those admitted to the hospital already had some complaints. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of the area also affect the deceased.
Regional gaps change the estimate of the mortality rate in this situation, while also due to the problems of the method.
Reducing the number of mild cases can lead to higher mortality.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of cases that have come into contact in the past may mean that the current mortality estimate has been lowered.
Those who smoke are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than those who do not smoke, and an estimated 2.4 times more people need intensive care or are more likely to die.
Officials at Hong Kong's hospital found that some people's lung capacity decreased by 20% - 30%, which was recovered from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
This is likely to lead to post-intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether the previous infection provided effective and long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Based on other coronavirus transactions, it can be said that immunity is likely to appear, but there are cases in which a coronavirus test has been reported positive in the next few days after recovering from COVID-19.
It is believed that in such cases, there may be a long-term infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural and its origin is believed to be an animal and its spread is due to infection.
The exact origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the virus was caused entirely by human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January in The Lancet showed that 1 December 2019 was the earliest date for symptoms to appear.
The official release by the WHO has listed December 8, 2019 as the start date for the symptoms to appear.
Various measures are generally adopted to calculate the death.
These numbers vary according to different regions and different times and are affected by the number of tests, quality of health care system, treatment options, the period from the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, the WHO provided emergency ICD-10 codes such as U07.1 for deaths confirmed by laboratory from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 infection with a medically confirmed or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 death-related case with U07.1.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9%.
This number is unchanged by region. Other measures include Case Mortality Rate (CFR), which displays the percentage of persons diagnosed, who die due to a disease, and ‘Infection Mortality Rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected person (determinated and undiagnosed), who died of a disease.
These figures are not bound by time and rely on the specific population infected through the case version.
Not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can probably inform how many people have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, a small village called Castiglion d'Adda has so far killed 4,600,80 (1.7%).
In Gengelt, the disease was caused by the Carnival Festival and spread among young people, which had a comparatively low mortality rate and may not formally classify all COVID-19-infected deaths as such.
Moreover, there is not as much burden on the German health system.
About 3% of people in the Netherlands may have antibodies, as reported from a blood donor.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality rate of this pandemic are different for women and men.
Studies conducted in China and Italy found that men have a higher mortality rate.
Men in their 50s are at the highest risk. The lowest gap between women and men is in the nineties.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact cause of these sexes is not known, but the cause may be genetic and behavioural.
The differences in gender-based immunity, the low prevalence of smoking in women, and the development of co-morbid conditions such as hypertension in men at a younger age than in women, could have been the cause of higher mortality among all men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government had not reported gender-interference among people infected with COVID-19.
The research found that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A large number of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at greater risk of getting infected with the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the WHO announced that the disease would be named "COVID-19."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO means coronavirus, VI means the virus, D means the disease and 19 is the year when the first outbreak of the disease came to light: 31 December 2019.
The name was given to avoid referring to a particular geographical location (such as China), animal species, or group of people, which were in line with the international recommendation of naming, and the purpose was to avoid stigmatizing anyone. This virus that causes COVID-19 is named Civic Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARSV-2).
In public communications, the WHO uses the "COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19."
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the coronavirus.
At the time of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and the virus, following the 2015 guidance against the use of the site in the name of the virus.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limited capacity of the standard earbuds, some digital manufacturers are printing health care materials as nail swabs and ventilator parts.
For example, when a ventilator valve was urgently needed at a hospital in Italy, and the supplier was unable to repair it on time, a local start-up company did reverse-engineering and printed 100 valves at night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, the origin, magnitude, treatment, and other cases of the disease were cut-off, incorrect and distorted information was created and spread rapidly online.
Humans have been able to spread the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence that it was a replica of the virus in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of the disease.
The government is working on international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the WHO launched a "Solidarity Trial" to assess the treatment effects of the four existing antiviral compounds that are most effective.
While there is no vaccine available at present, various agencies are actively creating 'less candidates'.
The study on SARS-CoV-2 is being used, as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 neural networks to enter human cells.
So far, three vaccines have been developed.
The goal of the research is to develop a vaccine for the virus.
The purpose of the use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead virus, is to produce a new infection with COVID-19 in the immediate response of the human body.
Another strategy is to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to a certain subunit of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spice protein that helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 enzyme nervous system.
A third strategy is about the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, an innovative technology for creating vaccinations).
In order to ensure the safety and efficacy of any of these three strategies, a clinical trial of one vaccine with four volunteers was launched at Seattle on March 16, 2020.
This vaccine has a non-threatening genetic code, which is replicated from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent promotion has been suggested as a potential challenge to develop the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active medical tests are being conducted.
Seven tests were being evaluated from treatments already approved for malaria, including four researches on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most Chinese research work includes multi-purpose antiviral drugs, according to a report submitted at the end of April that included nine tests on phase-III on remedivir in many countries.
As per the April 2020 report, there is a dynamic review of the medical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates. Several existing antiviral drugs have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Raytonavir and Interferone Beetto.
According to the March 2020 report, there is provisional evidence for the impact by Remdesivir.
Medical improvements were seen in patients treated with remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, a collective review is needed for this research.
Korean and Chinese health officials have recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends one gram of the dose per day and noted that its double dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The Chinese Seventh Edition guide also includes Interferon, Raybavirin or Yumifenovhair for use against COVID-19.
Primary data shows that a high dose of ribavirin is required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in the test.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further testing after exposure to low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that transmembrane protein is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE-2 technique. Proteins have been introduced through the very protein-rich protein protein protein protein protein-2 (TMPRSS2)
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major problems preventing the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir did not restrict SARS-CoV-2 in experiments and found no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storms are likely to be more complex in the next phase of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. After a short study, Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guide by the National Health Commission of China.
In Italy, non- randomized tests are being carried out at the national level after seeing positive results in people with severe illness.
Combining serum ferritin with blood tests to identify cytokine storms, means resisting such development, which has been considered to be the cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved interleukin-6 neuronal antibodies based on a pre-effective study for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome, a different cause called CAR T cell treatment.
There is no randomized, controlled evidence that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The research is being carried out as a non-lactating method of inactivated immunization of purified and concentrated antibodies created by the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19.
This strategy was used for SARS, but it did not yield any special results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action, by which passive antibody treatment can be performed against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytes, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are under development, for example, using built-in monoclonal antibodies.
The production of quinvalcent serum, which includes the blood fluid protein of recovered patients, and which includes antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased for rapid development.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, succumbed to COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
