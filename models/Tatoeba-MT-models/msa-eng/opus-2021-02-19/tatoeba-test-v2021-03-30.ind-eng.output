I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom's forgetful.
Where have you been?
Traffic lights are used to regulate traffic.
Don't let Tom see these pictures.
This room's got a little bit of sunshine.
He's painting a picture.
I shouldn't have run that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I'm getting used to not staying up all night.
It smells really bad.
A sentence is a sentence.
There is no god but God and Muhammad is the messenger of God.
Just yesterday I found out.
You can buy it at the bookstore.
Let's get on the Intercity-Express train.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My brother loves music.
It's easy to get along with Tom.
Going home?
No one cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I thought I could come by this afternoon.
"It's worth two hours." "Yes, I'll keep this signature for the rest of my life."
Tom was one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I was just telling Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's ants.
You'll never find your way home, through a narrow rocky road.
Tom wasn't really home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
The guy drives a car.
There's a birthday card coming up.
Please read it again.
When will you be able to do that?
I'm just kidding.
Tom almost got hit.
I'm going too.
Love is never wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
The cost has included payment for professional services to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn a logogram, do you?
Tom was trying to persuade Mary to help him.
Two things are irrelevant.
How could I not realize this?
What's this called?
I stayed home because it was raining.
That's the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
For me, there is no fundamental difference between culture and both countries.
He's having an affair.
Wake me up at eight o'clock.
Tell me why he's not here.
It's probably what affected their decision.
The rain lasted all night long.
Tom's getting jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that terrible?
I'll buy this bag for you.
The cake is too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Have you ever been to London?
It's our responsibility to help.
How was the party?
I'm not ready.
Mary refused an invitation to the concert.
When are you coming home?
He sits around his grandchildren.
The boy suddenly fell asleep in his bed.
Jim's still not used to driving to the left of the road.
He's focused on the puzzle.
The man died a few hours ago.
Want to go eat with me?
This feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We know that the front door is locked.
May I speak with Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith is an acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid of flying a plane.
I had suspected that he was lying, but it didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice.
I can't finish reading this thick book in a week.
The timing was very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have a choice.
I'm not sure what else to do.
We've done everything we can.
Are there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Don't you speak English?
In front of the law we're all aligned, but rich people sometimes have more advantages.
He's gonna make it.
I love cats.
The meeting is over at nine.
Tom was mentally disturbed.
Could I be crazy?
We've had a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone makes mistakes.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mother's been gone for ten years.
Nobody's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, it's just that you can't drive.
May I see your coupons?
He looks serious reading.
Tom married an easier woman than he did.
He's a copy of his father.
He has good words for insulting himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm excited.
He tried to kill himself but in the end he failed.

They advised him to go alone.
Tom was a good man.
I'll call you back in 20 minutes.
They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom tricked Mary.
No less than 40 percent of the students went to university.
Tom put his pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom turned his voice down so that no one could hear him.
You see anything?
What are you looking at?
Is she long hair?
He greets her every morning, as she enters the school building.
I thought he was a doctor.
It's so steep, it's better to go to the left.
We didn't really see the accident.
His mother is worried about his son.
What opera is being shown at Lincoln Center right now?
I feel tired.
Tom murdered Mary.
The data is often inaccurate.
Get up!
We've ordered the six-thirty.
We named the dog Tim.
He opened the letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom signaled Mary to follow him.
It's eleven o'clock.
I'm smarter than they are.
The sky is getting dark.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knew him admired him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those people are crazy!
