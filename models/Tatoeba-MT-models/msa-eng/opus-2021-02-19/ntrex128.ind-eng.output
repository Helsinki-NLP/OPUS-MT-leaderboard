The Welsh (AM) members are worried when they “seem to be muppets. ”
There are concerns among some AM towards a suggestion that their term should be changed to MWPs.
This has resulted in plans to change the name of the Council into Welsh Parliament.
AMers across the political spectrum are concerned if it can invite ridicule.
An AM labor party said that his group was concerned, "It's the same as Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
A member of the assembly (AM) said that his group as one, felt "unhappy" and had proposed some alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative says that his group is "open-minded" to a change of name, but assesses that this is a pun from the acronym of the MWP to the Muppets.
In this context, w letters in Welsh are spoken like u in Yorkshire English.
The Council's current commission to establish the change of the name, says: "The final decision of any explanation of the term for the generals is of course a problem for the members themselves."
The government ruling of Wales 2017 authorized the Council of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission published public consultation results on proposals that were known to have widely supported to call the Council Welsh Parliament.
On issues called AM, the Commission prefers WMPs (Welsh Parliament Memers/ Welsh Parliament), but the MWP has the most support of public consultation.
The AM seems to be filing an alternative option, but the struggle to reach the consensus could be confusing for the chairman, Elin Jones, who was expected to submit the design of the change law within a few weeks.
These reform laws will include other changes about how the assembly works, including the rules of the disqualified for the AM and design system committee.
The AM will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the law.
The Macedonians went to vote for the referendum about changing the country's name.
The voting owners will decide whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonian Republic."
The famous vote was held in an effort to settle a decade of disagreement with the Greek neighboring country, which also had a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor demonstrates a confession to its territory and has repeatedly refused to offer membership to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian president Gjorge Ibanov, a voter for a change of name, had said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is a price to pay to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bells don't ring when the churches in Harlem are having trouble.
"Historially, the parents I talked to said there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adam.
"Today, there is no one."
He said that the disappearance of all the bars was understandable.
"People socialize in other ways" these days, he says.
"Bar is no longer a guest room around where people visit him regularly."
And so with the church, he's worried that the money the asset sells won't last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they'll be back from the start."
The churches, he added, could have replaced the apartment buildings with condos filled with people who wouldn't help keep the sanctums around him.
"The mayoritas who are going to buy condos in these buildings are white," he said, "and therefore will speed up the day the churches close together because there is no way the people who move into these condos are going to be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by the white congregation before Harlem became a black Metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodists moved in the 1930s.
The black people who have been worshiping in the vicinity have taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation led by Reverend John Howard, who led a retail boycott on 125th Street, the main shopping road in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
Fires in 1939 caused heavy damage to the building, but when Reverend Johnson parishers planned to rebuild, they built tower bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly refer to the bell of the tower as "the collar of the poor."
An expert who rang the tower bell in July gave him another name: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
An expert, Tiffany Ng of Michigan University also noted that this was the first tower bell in the world played by black musicians Dionysio A. Lind who switched to ring the bigger tower bells at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin in the last few months has been a complicated architectural story and contractor, some brought along by a common church leader, and others brought along by the Episcopal archdiocese.
The vestry--the body of the archdiocese manager, formed from the general leaders-- wrote a letter to the archdiocese in July with the concern that the diocese "will strive to charge" on the venstry, although the vestry is not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the archdiocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency from the diocese.
Sharks hurt 13-year-olds in lobster diving in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch lobsters in California at the opening of lobster season, one officer said.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinity.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy asking for help and then rowing in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just the excitement after catching lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: ‘ I was bitten!
I'm bitten!'
"Hammel said that he realized it when he grabbed the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to come out of the water: ‘ There is a shark in the water!’ Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was dealt with in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
The Coastal Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area one week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless shark species.
Giles adds that the victim was seriously injured at the top of his body.
Officials shut down access to the coast from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinity for 48 hours for investigation and for security.
Giles realized that there were more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sciencebury's plan to break down the British beauty market.
Sciencebury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty stalls styled tossers run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial urge on the British beauty market for £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while the sale of fashion products and household equipment declines, the larger beauty stalls will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if that is proved successful.
The investment in beauty became a hunting platform for supermarkets to use the shelves that used to display TV, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sciencebury said that it would double the amount of beauty offers up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current branding sequence starts with L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more room with brandy areas like the ones found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also launches its network of boutique makeup so that most of its products will be friendly to vegans - something young shoppers are interested in more and more.
Also, the retailer of the Fragrance Shop will test the concessions at two Sciencesbury stores, the first to open in Croydon.
Online shopping and changing purchases of daily needs in small amounts in local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sciencesbury, has said that the stalls are going to look more like malls when supermarket chains are trying to fight back suppressors like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and more services without food.
Sciencebury has placed Argos stalls on hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat stalls since they bought those two franchises two years ago, which is said to have supported daily food sales and made a more profitable acquisition.
The previous supermarket effort to renovate the beauty and pharmaceutical department ended in failure.
Sciencebury tested the work with Boots in early 2000, but cooperation ended after a conflict about how to split the profits from the chemical store in the supermarket.
A new strategy appeared after Sciencebury sold 281 pharmaceutical shops to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmaceutical franchise, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was announced that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding various brands of luxurious skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sciencebury, says: "We have changed the look and nuance of the beauty stalls to improve the atmosphere for our visitors' sake.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our branding sequences are designed so that they fit all the needs, all the attractive environments and comfortable locations that indicate that we're now an enticing goal that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones got angry after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the $11 million deal.
Dragons Den, Peter Jones went off “in a fit of rage” after the TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million business deal to focus more on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to manage their home supplies and accessories brands, Truly.
This couple's business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of This Morning, 37 years old, uses his Instagram account to announce that he's out.
Holly Willoughby has made the Dragons" Den, Petes Jones furious by withdrawing at the last moment, from their lucrative branding lifestyle business - to focus on his larger contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources state that Jones was so angry when the golden TV girl admitted during a thrilling meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new deal - was worth £1.5 million - meaning she no longer had enough time to devote herself to their home supplies and accessories brand, Truly.
Their business has been likened to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand and is estimated to double Willoughby's wealth by £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Britannia to one of his vacation homes,
One source says: "Truly so far is Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be a long-term future, which will keep him going for decades to come.
His decision to back off surprised everyone involved.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, really close to the launch date.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's main office ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning’s host, one of England’s most expensive stars, can cost the company millions of dollars because of large investments in product form, from pillows and candles to clothing and home supplies, as well as the potential delays in further launch.
And this could mean the end of a long-standing friendship relationship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband and Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52 - year - old Jones joined the chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones owned 40 percent of the shares on Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV program called I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We won't comment on this business relationship."
Talking seriously 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism he was going to receive from the news media because he made a comment that some people considered "not presidential" and had been very positive about North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "newsreader" voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He found out that Kim was interested in meeting the second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump praised as a step forward for North Korea's denuclearization.
But the negotiation of the denuclearization has ceased.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's highest diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an appropriate "respons" from the United States on the first movement of North Korea's arms.
On the contrary, he noted that the United States continued to carry out sanctions intended to maintain pressure.
Trump had a more optimistic view of his speech.
"We did our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people are gonna get killed.
Now we have this incredible relationship,"
He said that his success in repairing his relationship with Kim had brought positive results - stopping rocket trials, helping free the hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people on the outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we better have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing at the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunamis and Earthquakes Destroyed an Island, Killed Hundreds
As a result of Lombok’s earthquake, for example, non governmental foreign organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population is homeless, there is no declaration of a national disaster, as a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've made it clear that they're not asking for international help, so this is a bit challenging," said Mrs. Roof.
While Save The Children are putting together a team to leave for Palu, it's still unclear whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of a national disaster relief agency, says that Indonesian officials are reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies are allowed to contribute to giving assistance.
In view of the earth’s constant shocks in Indonesia, this country is still far from ready for natural anger.
While tsunami shelters have been built on Aceh, that is not a common view on other coastlines.
The absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite the warning of danger, has likely contributed to the death toll.
At the best of times, the journey among many Indonesian islands was challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A floating hospital that has been placed in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Wido has made repairs to Indonesian infrastructure that are damaged as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on road construction and railroads.
But the lack of funds has disrupted Mr. Joko's government while he faces another election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled their homes when Muslim and Christian hordes fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Witness: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge puts a counterweight goal against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing Chelsea to the Premier League with one minute score on 89 on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received a decoy from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters outside Chelsea's wicket when his team left 1-0.
He puts the ball on his left side before kicking it towards the far pole.
The ball soars high above the goal when the ball rises to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell through Kepa Arrizabaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," said the Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and take one chance and not think about it too much, and just do a kick."
Chelsea leads 1-0 in the middle of the first half after the Belgian player Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue invaders gave Mateo Kovacic feedback to the game, before spinning near the center line and running fast to the center of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly fed and ran in the center line.
He then did a perfect kick, leading Hazard to the goal.
Hazard made it past the opponent's bench and kicked the ball into the corner with a left foot kick, past the Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool vs. Naples in the opening of the Champions League group at 3 p.m. Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faces Videoton at the UEFA of the European League at 3:00 p.m. Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami increased to 832
The deaths of earthquakes and Indonesian tsunamis have increased to 832, says the country’s disaster agency on Sunday morning.
Many people are reportedly trapped in the ruins of buildings crushed by 7.5 earthquakes that hit on Friday and triggered 20 feet of waves, says Sutopo Purwo, spokesperson of the agency at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with ruins of fallen buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32 years old, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation was committed after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
44-year-old woman found at Grayson Mews, John Street, at 7:55 a.m. with multiple stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police have asked anyone around who saw or heard something to come face-to-face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "Investigation is still in its early stages but I'm asking everyone who was around John's road in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also encourage everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dash cameras to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
The police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was local Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who were convinced that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues as the police have said, they're in the process of telling the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just returned to his apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man can't say anything when he finds out what's going on.
Currently citizens are being told that it will take a few hours for them to be allowed to reenter.
A police officer was being heard informing someone that all areas are currently being held as the scene of a crime.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
He's always repeating 'this is terrible'.
At 2:00 p.m. two police vans are in line and the others are outside.
A number of officers stood in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCc, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at number 0800 555 111 by quoting log 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament became the last memorial to be affected by the ‘resurrection of history'
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban to many British cultural and religious artifacts carried out by fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell people described Mr. Crick's advice as "foolishness" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "This is inevitable in the current debate about the destruction of statues, that the figure Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster's palace will be targeted.
British civil war iconoclasm was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell bloodline would be sacrificed for Thomas' ancestral actions in the previous century.
The remarkable representation of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of a 19th-century opinion and part of the historicalography of a figure that many still believe to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, as parliament defender against outside pressure, in his case of course the government.
Is that a fully accurate representation, still subject to ongoing historical debates.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure that represents one side of that difference.
Its success as a Lord deserves to be celebrated."
The Pig Killer Persecuts Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name "Yuan," was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pigsty in the Guizhou province market of South China Morning Post reporting on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine to pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining Qinghai province, China.
He was reported to have left with his cousin from the Yunnan province neighboring area on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and saw the door of a nearby pigsty open.
He said that in a pigsty there was a big pig with blood in its mouth.
Forensics studies confirm that the 550 - pound male pig has persecuted the farmer to death, based on a report.
"My cousin is bleeding and crushed," said the cousin who was known as "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed that man doesn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities have reportedly negotiated compensation for his death.
Although rare, the cases of pig attacks on humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their field in Massachusetts that left the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until the wife frightened and drove the beast away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but the smell of blood can act as "triggers".
"They're just playing around.
They're biters, very curious they won't come out to hurt you.
You just need to give him enough respect," he said
The remnants of Rosa's storm brought heavy rain to the southwest of the United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa was weakened while moving over colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
In any event, Rosa will cause flooding all over northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa has wind speeds of 85 mph, Category One, starting at 5 a.m. on Sundays during the Eastern Territory, and located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa may be moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Palung began to form above the Pacific Ocean and moved east toward the West Coast of the U.S., as Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began to push tropical moisture north to southwest.
Rosa will bring rain to 10 inches in parts of Mexico by Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching manger will create a widespread torrential rain in the southwest for the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause a dangerous flood, a stream of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause the rainfall rate to near 2 to 3 inches per hour at several points, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain is estimated to be falling in some part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
A flood may have occurred with conditions that worsened rapidly because of the widespread properties of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to explore the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause chasms to become violent rivers and storms will carry strong winds locally and dusty.
The approaching chandeliers will cause a heavy local rain to part of the Southern California coastline.
The total rainfall that exceeds half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to be slippery.
It'll be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Some tropical rains will start approaching Arizona by the end of Sunday and Monday morning, before the rains become wider on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to four corners on Tuesday and survive until Wednesday.
In October there will be some great changes in temperature throughout the U.S. when the Arctic gets colder, but the tropical region remains quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic change in temperature over short distances.
There is an exact example of a dramatic temperature difference along the U.S. area at noon on Sunday.
There's a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer warmth will form and return to spread.
Most of the U.S. areas in the middle and east are expected to start warm starting in October with an 80s spread from the Southlands to the northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast showed a high probability of temperatures above average for the eastern U.S. until the early middle of October.
Over 20 million people have witnessed Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by the high court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault suspected of in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political impassion continues, with publishers interrupting regular events to announce the latest minute of Friday: A deal designed by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to investigate for a week on the charges.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure if Kavanaugh groped her body drunk and tried to take her clothes off at the High School party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
There may be over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen by Friday have seen it.
The company calculates the average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for other networks that broadcast it is not available quickly, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen is usually having trouble counting the number of people who saw him at the office.
To put this in perspective, it's the number of viewers that's almost the same as a football playoff or Academy Awards game.
Fox News Channel, whose public opinion strongly supports Kavanaugh’s appointment, excels all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day, says Nielsen.
ABC takes second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
Fans stay high after trial.
Flake is the key figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican Party office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being yelled at by protesters when he tried to take the elevator to the Justice Committee trial.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was cursed, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think that he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, 'You have power when there are many helpless women.'
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he had much more to say in the committee's court.
The cable TV and broadcast networks all covered live hours later, when the Justice Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's candidacy throughout the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that with the understanding that the FBI will examine charges against the candidate for the next week, as the Democrat minority has requested.
Flake has been partially convinced by a conversation with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice has power, because it's clear that the Republicans won't have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened up an FBI investigation on charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister accused the ‘political play’ critics of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused "political play" critics with the future of Britannia and ruined national interests, for his plans to get out of the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews that presented it on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed the attack on what he called the Chequers' plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal about England and the EU who had to collect each other's rates was "full of nonsense."
Police arrested a Dyteon Simpson suspect in the death of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges, says Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found those glasses at the scene and said that they found Simpson's DNA on the stuff, the WAFB CBS affiliates reported.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said that he had claimed to have taken a fatal shot at Wayde.
The contract has been set up for $350,000, the Advocate reports.
The East Baton Rouge Paroki Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The department thanks the wanted police task force of the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the surrounding residents in assisting in an investigation that leads to arrest.
The athletic director of LSU Joe Alleva thanks local law enforcement for "constancy and justice quest."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
At 6.6 feet of living in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
His average point was 5.6 and soared to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said his team felt "destroyed" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
""This is what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcanoes spew ashes in Mexico City
Ash that came out of the volcano of Popocatepetl has reached the southern area of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warns Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increases in craters and is listed as 183 gas and ash emissions within more than 24 hours.
The center monitors several times the roar and vibration.
The images on social media show a thin layer of ash attached to the windshield of a car in the neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysics experts have recorded an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The Volcanoe is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
The police clashed with Catalan separatists before the celebration of the election of independence.
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-liberation demonstrations clashed with riot police, and when thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark Catalonia's first vocalization celebration of seclusion.
A group of masked pro-separatists arrested by riot police threw eggs at them and threw powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Another dispute followed that day with a police officer who used their staff to control the conflict.
For several hours a group of pro-liberates shouted "No forget, no forgiveness" confronted the protestors of a union that shouted, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the protest, the local press reported.
Tensions remained high in this free - oriented region, a year after the October 1st referendum that Madrid considered illegal but celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
Voters prefer to be free, despite low voters with those who resist segregation and most boycott elections.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop polling polls on polls throughout the region in violent clashes.
The pro-liberate groups have been camping overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support the national police.
Demonstration continued but was forced to take different routes.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife said he no longer wished for Catalonia’s prospect of independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for joy in being able to choose, but now we are trapped," she said.
Despite a slight victory in regional elections last December, the pro-liberal parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders, who are either in exile or in custody awaiting trial, for their role in organizing the referendum and further declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with her phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of Catalan who were imprisoned in pre-trial since last year, announced that he would run for European Parliament next year.
"Standing as candidates for European elections is the best way to condemn setbacks in democratic values and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car · Global Voices
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly bumped into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings said that damage happened to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired at a car at some point.
The goal printed by Menang has given Livingston victory over Rangers with a score of 1-0.
Dolly’s first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Livingston's victory resulted in the Rangers firing Steven Gerrard from his post as manager of the Hebox Club, over the defeat of both in 18 games.
Dolly's attack has proved to be a difference when Gary Holt's side movement is equivalent to the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side remains unwinnable in the Premiership of this season and faces the leaders of the Hearts who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers celebrated Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, in the meantime, extended their undefeated record in division to six games, while Coach Holt's head still felt defeat since his replacement for Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost his chance against a sloppy guest team.
Holt's team should have been ahead of them long before they scored, with their precision giving Rangers various difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but he missed the goal face, and then Alan Lithgow only widened his efforts after the slide and confronted Craig Halkett's sunset from across the wicket.
The host is content to let the Rangers play superior in the first place, knowing that they can make it difficult for the immigrant team to die.
And that's a way to generate a very important goal.
Rangers break free kicks and Livingston gets a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson join together to help out the Army, who takes turns and scores from the center of the field.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated control but realized that the host's defenses were impenetrable and Liam Kelly's goalkeepers were entirely uninterrupted,
The pattern continues until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to lure the rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was taken by the feet of the goalkeepers Allan McGregor and Lithgow were knocked out by another Livingston game plan.
The attack continues to come into Livingston's wicket and is constantly inevitable, while two penalty claims--after Halckett's challenge on the replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for handball--rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston - analysis
Scotland BBC Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
Performa and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
For a man, they're incredible, going beyond hope on this continuous track.
Their play and personnel have barely changed since they returned to the board, but large credits must be given to Holt for the way he strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many champions.
Captain Halkett is very large, leading well organized defenses, while he's making Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall keep an eye out during the game.
Nevertheless, the Rangers lack inspiration.
As good as they were when under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was not good - only once could they break up the host side formation - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who recognized their presence in the middle of the field.
Erdogan received a variety of welcomes in Cologne.
There was a smile and a blue skyline on Saturday (September 29) when the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They're arguing about problems including human rights, freedom of press and entry of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new great mosque.
It is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police mentioned a security reason to block the crowd of 25,000 people gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protestors - many of them Kurds - are also vocal, censure both, Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The resistance protests describe the presence of an immigrant who was welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and reviled as a dictator by other residents.
Collision on the Deptford highway: cyclist was killed in a car crash.
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
Collisions occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, approximately 10:15 BST.
The driver had stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died on the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan police say that officers are trying to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads are closed and bus tracks have been imposed and motorists are encouraged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in chaos.
Six guards were injured in a riot in a heavily guarded male prison, the lapas office stated.
A riot broke out in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire about 9:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and still continues.
"Tornado" Specialist has been deployed to deal with the riot, involving eight prisoners and happening on one side of the building.
Officers are being treated at the scene due to minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained lapas officer has been deployed to deal with the current incident at the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injury.
We don't tolerate the violence in this prison, and it's clear that the responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend much longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prisons hold over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the warden was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October of last year a riot officer was called to prison to deal with a serious riot where a lapas officer was attacked with a billiard ball.
Hurricane Rosa Threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Floods (It's Possible for a Drought)
The tropical depression that hit Arizona is rare, but that's what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week because of the traces of Hurricane Rosa's energy left in the southwest desert, resulting in the risk of a flood.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings of a flood on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona region to southern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is thought to lead straight past Phoenix on Tuesday, going to hit on Monday night with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned in twitter that there are only "ten tropical hurricanes capable of causing tropical storms or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest storm center device capable of predicting 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with an isolated 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert include Central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to be hit by 1 to 2 inches, with a possible total of 4 inches of isolation.
For those in the flood - free region, Rosa’s rain may have been a blessing because the region was inundated.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be profitable because the southwest region is currently suffering from drought.
According to U.S.A., the U.S. drought observer, only about 40 percent of Arizona region is experiencing at least extreme drought, second highest category,"weather.com reports.
First, the path that Hurricane Rosa travels leads to land across the California Baja peninsula
Rosa, still at the power of storms on Sunday mornings at wind speeds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm met the colder areas of the Pacific and therefore weakened its power.
Therefore, it is thought that it will land in Mexico with the power of tropical storms by Monday afternoon or by night.
Rainfall may have been high in parts of Mexico, putting the risk of a high flood
"Total rainfall 3 to 6 inches is estimated to hit the Baja California area to the southwest of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches,"weather.com reports.
Rosa will then travel north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will pass through Arizona and south Utah on Tuesday at midnight.
"The main risk that Rosa's storm may have caused or its remains is a very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwest region of Sonora, and the U.S. southwest region of the U.S. desert." National Hurricane Center (NHC) states.
The rain is expected to cause the threat of floods and debris of buildings flowing into the desert, and landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton's attack: arrest four suspects attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a stab wound in Somerset.
The teenage male was found injured in Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton's territory, about 4 p.m. BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in stable condition.
A 17 - year - old teenager, two 18 - year - olds and a 20 - year - old man was arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, says the Police.
Officers have called anyone who may have a video of the incident on his phone to come in and report it.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "accepted hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful Democratic scheme," said Trump on a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "accepted hatred and anger" from the Democrats during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, by force and emotionally denying a charge from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually abused him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The President said on Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and qualities and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm a man who has the most perfect legal mind in our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he told the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The president implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's candidacy when he talks about the importance of Republican participation in mid-election.
"Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really racing," he said.
"That's why I went all the way here, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argues that Democrats are on a mission to "fight and block."
The first polling procedure on the Senate level in Kavanaugh can be performed at the latest Friday, a senior GOP aide says on CNN.
Hundreds of people died from Indonesian earthquakes, tsunamis, with increasing casualties
At least 384 people were killed, many were washed away when a giant wave hit the beach, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi on Saturday, says the authorities.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in Palu on Friday when waves six feet [6 m] high (18 feet] destroyed the shore at dusk, causing many deaths and destructions.
Tsunami followed by an earthquake with a 7.5 force.
"When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still doing their thing on the beach and didn't run so soon that they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Disaster Relief Agency (BNPB) said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami did not come alone, he dragged the car, the wood, the house, crashing all over the land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had passed through the high seas at 800 kph (497 mph) before crashing the coastline.
Some people climb trees to save themselves from tsunamis and survive, he says.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Photos of air released by BNPB show many buildings and broken shops, crooked bridges and collapses and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks in a row rocked the city along the coast on Saturday.
The string of earthquakes felt in the population of 2.4 million people.
The Ministry of Technology Research and Rendering (BPPT) says in a statement that the energy released in the Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb explosive that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay, can increase the size of the tsunami, in a sense.
Nugroho described the damage that occurred as "extension" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under the ruins of a destroyed building, saying, adding that there were 540 injured and 29 missing persons.
Nugroho says that victims and damage may be greater along the 300 - mile [300 km] coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
"Communication is completely paralyzed with the absence of information from Donggala, says Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there," says the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers are heading toward disaster - affected territory.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse," she said.
The related incident on that Saturday received much criticism because it did not inform us that a tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said that the waves had been crashing at the time of the warning.
An amateur record shared at social media shows a man upstairs in a building who's heard a screaming warning in a panic of a tsunami approaching, towards people on the street below him.
In a matter of minutes a water scroll hits the beach, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately prove the authenticity of the tape.
Earthquakes and tsunamis are the largest cause of blackouts that cut off communication around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo ships with support from Jakarta and other cities, says the authorities, but the refugees still need food and other basic needs.
The airport has reopened only to channel relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Hammer on Sunday.
Indonesian Tsunami victims have risen above 800.
That's terrible.
When the employees of the World Vision from Donggala made it safely to Palu, where the officials took refuge in the tarpaulin tent built in their office yard, on their journey through various devastated areas, said Mr. Doseba.
"They tell me that they've seen a lot of destroyed houses," she said.
It was horrible.
Even when the relief group began to move slowly to start disaster countermeasures, some of the group complained of a ban on foreign volunteers who had skills, who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, foreign aid and energy can only begin distribution if the affected area has been officially declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
'It's still a state-level disaster,' said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"By the time the government says, OK, this is a national disaster," we can receive international assistance, but no such status yet."
On the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing victims still hoped that their loved ones would be part of a miracle that would fix the grim storyline of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from the sewer.
On Sunday, a rescuer released a woman trapped under the rubble for two days with the mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national kite team, has been coached by two missing paragliding athletes, who have been following the Asian Games that ended early this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped at the Roa-Roa Hotel, along with Mr. Mandagi, are his disciples.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional personal burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us again how after news about the Roa-Roa Hotel was circulated around the paragliding community, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the pallu competitors, who participated in celebrations on the beach.
Nevertheless, all the messages, they only got one gray tick, not two blue ticks.
"I think it means the message wasn't sent," she said.
The robbers took $26,750 during the ATM charge in Newport in Levee.
A robbery on Friday morning stole $26,750 from an officer of Brink who was reloading an ATM machine storage box in Newport, based on news from the Newport Police Department.
The driver has emptied an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and is preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy is writing in a press release.
While he was at work, another man ran behind Brink's crew and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Eyewitnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, based on the news, but the police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity can contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Advertising the name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has had Ye's nickname for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was canceled for "emotional reasons," said the creator of the show.
As a shorthand for his current professional name, West had previously said that for him the word had religious meaning.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," says West earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with the Big Boy Radio publisher.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that name is us.
That name was taken from Kanye, which means only one, being Ye-- as a mirror of our good, our vice, our confusion, everything.
That album is more of a reflection of who we really are."
He's one of the few rappers that changed their names.
Sean Combs in various ways has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year has announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a liaison and a capital letter.
The president of Mexico, AMLO, vowed not to use the military in the face of civil society.
Chosen President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sworn never to use military force against civilian society before the 50th anniversary of a bloody countermeasure against a student.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to suppress Mexicans."
The army launched a fire at a peaceful demonstration activity in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, when the movement of the left-wing students planted its roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has guaranteed support for young Mexicans by subsidizing monthly subsidies for those in college and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education opportunities encourage young people to form gangs of criminals.
The U.S. was supposed to double the A.I. funding.
Because China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funds that will be used for research in that field, says investors and practitioners of Kai-Fu Lee, who have worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made an announcement about AI, even when the U.S. was a total lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: to become number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Duplicate AI research funds is a good start, considering all other countries tend to fall behind from the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
Double the funding can double the odds so that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synnovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that defeated the best American Othello players, and then he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's competition of technology earlier like the Robotics Challenge for the Muthir Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win prizes from the government, says Lee.
"It wasn't China that took the lead of academics; it was the company," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring university figures for AI research for the last few years.
Lee says that immigration policy changes can also help the U.S. to support efforts surrounding AI.
"I think a green card can be offered automatically for a PhD holder in AI," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued the next generation of artificial intelligence development plans in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funds for people in academic institutions the same way that the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organizations are distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic duty is lower in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year in the U.S. Defense Department developed a joint artificial intelligence center, aimed at involving industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced a Committee Selection formation for artificial Intelligence.
And in this month DARPA (Argental Defense Research Agency) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called Al Next.
As for NSF, DARPA recently invested over 100 million dollars a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that requested the establishment of the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence hasn't seen any follow-up for months.
The Macedonians voted in order to change the country's name.
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide the name of the country to be "The Republic of North Macedonia," an action that would settle a decade's dispute with Greece that had presided over its membership offer to become part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, who owns a province called Macedonia, maintains the opinion that the name of its northern neighbor represents the recognition of ownership of its territory and has forbidden the country to join NATO and the European Union.
Both governments reached an agreement in June based on a new name raised, but the nationalist opposition argued that change would damage the identity of most of Slavic ethnic populations.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he wouldn't give his vote to the election and a boycott campaign has instilled a doubt whether the election results could reach the minimum of 50 percent of the votes required to be declared legal.
The question on the soundlot reads: "Do you approve NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece."
Supporters for name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it's a fair price to get permission to enter the agency like the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born from the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to give my vote for the future of the country, for the sake of the young Macedonian generation so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, quite a few MPs said they would comply with the results of the vote to make a decision.
The change of name requires two thirds of sound in parliament.
The state election commission says there's been no reports of a breach until 1:00 p.m.
Nevertheless, it turns out the vote was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliament in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters gave their votes.
"I came to give my vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said a 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and her son Dushko gave their votes for a general election in Macedonia in order to change the name of the country that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, has prepared a small stage and pulled the seats in front of the tents made by those who would boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we'd like to join with you honorably, not through the door of a servant," said Kavadarkov.
"We are poor countries, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonians, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring more investments needed for Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent unemployment rate.
"I believe most of the population will agree because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," said Zaev after giving his voice letter.
He said the result of "yes" would be "confirm our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the necessary amount.
Another poll, held by Telma’s Macedonian TV station, found 57 percent of respondents planning to participate in their voices on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they'd vote yes.
For the vote to be successful, it would take 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure to vote will represent a first policy rejection against the pro-West government since taking over in May of last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City explored the entire Brighton defense to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton defense on the 2-0 Manchester City victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero makes that victory look so easy on the score in 65 minutes.
Argentinean attackers received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the match.
He ran between the three defendant Brighton, before he ventured into the open field.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He turned past one defendant before running ahead of a few more opponents at the end of Brighton's goal.
Then he passed to his left, to Sterling.
The English front quarterback used his first kick from the goal to pass the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to defeat Brighton's goalie, Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero fought with some trouble at his feet," said Pep Guardiola manager City to the reporter.
"We're talking about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal occurred at the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, deep inside Brighton's territory on that game.
He passed the ball with a fascinating far kick through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little bump before leading Sterling to the farthest outpost.
Sky Blue's front quarterback is tossing the ball toward the goal just before it slides out of the border.

Scherzer wants to snitch on the spoiler versus the Rockies.
With Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there's no reason to impose another match.
But Scherzer's overly competitive hopes to outmaneuver the Colorado Rockies on Sunday games, but only if there's still a playoff implication for Rockies, who excels in one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies have at least earned their place after winning a wild-card game against Nationals with a score of 5-2 on Friday night, but still trying to win their first division.
"Even if we play without winning, at least we can figure out the mood in Denver with a crowd of people and other teams who will compete at the highest level of any point I might be facing this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a match?"
Nationals haven't announced an opening match for Sunday, but it's reported that in such circumstances, they tend to let Scherzer compete.
Scherzer, who will start the fight for the 34th time, has a training session on Thursday and starts a Sunday game that is usually used to rest.

Trump is campaigning in West Virginia.
The president is implicitly referring to the situation involving the future Supreme Court judge of his choice, Brett Kavanaugh, as he talks about the importance of Republican vote in mid-election.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the great, great -- I don't really run that's why I fight all over the place for extraordinary candidates," he said.
Trump goes on, "You see a very, very, very, very, very radical Democrat group, you can see it's happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you see evil, their abominations.
They don't care who they hurt, who they run to get power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control, we're not giving it to them."
Democrats, he said, were on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "fate and evil and vile and untrustworthy."
He referred to the Senate Dianne Feinstein who served on the Senate Court Committee in his name, who was welcomed by the harshest reviling of his listeners.
"Remember what the answer is?
Did you leak those documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for him -- it's a very bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labor Party is no longer a public service.
Now it's an integral attitude to anyone who speaks his mind.
When Momentum activists at my local party voted for me, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I was in the last order of Parliament, which was told that our presence was not expected - all because we spoke up.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, got the same treatment because she defended antisemitism firmly.
In my case, the denunciation criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, the issue that is ironically the same as Jeremy Corbyn's against previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting of the East Nottingham workers on Friday states that "we want the meeting to be exclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years I was a member of the local Labor Parliament, meeting the General Committee on Friday night was exactly like that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises of "better, more gracious politics" has long since been forgotten, if, indeed it has ever begun.
Differences of opinion in the labor party are becoming more and more intolerable and every opinion is judged worthy by the authority of the party.
It started as soon as Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague who I had thought would share the same political views, began to expect me to cross paths and accept positions that I would never accept before in the national security or the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak openly--and no matter what I say--then after that there will be a reviling on social media that requests a nullification, insults central politics, tells me I shouldn't be in the Labor Party.
And it wasn't just me.
Of course, I know that I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because comments directed at me tend to be political.
I admire my professionalism and the limitations of my colleagues who face sexual abuse or racism every day but never avoid it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the political age today is how much abuse has been considered natural.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the labor party should help develop the culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer in a broader church and with every "unconfident" motion or changing the selection of party rules becomes more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the last two years that drove me to keep my head down, not too much of a voice of opinion, and then I'd say "okay."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labor Party 32 years ago when I was a school student, provoked by thatcher's misrepresentation that led to my comprehensive school class literally collapse, I've been trying to fight for better public service for those who desperately need it - both as a local counselor and as a minister in government.
I never hid my political actions, including the last election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my position of policy and the things I don't approve of in leadership today.
For those who advocate a motion on Friday, all I can say is that when the country moves rapidly to a split sovereignty (Brexit), it will endanger our country's business and public service, I don't want to waste time and energy for loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituency, as a member of the Labor Party or not.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The invincible Ayr goes up to the top
The last two trials may have been a bit of a cheat at the end, but there's no doubt Ayr deserves to win the Tennent's Premiership match which is very entertaining today.
Now they're at the top, the only invincible party of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and their ability to achieve the best of opportunities, which gives team hosts and coach Peter Murchie the right to be happy.
"So far we've been testing our game, and we're still invincible so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose says: "A regard for Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute experiment, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but a yellow card for captain Scotland Rory Hughes, was given the game by Warriors, giving Melrose the opportunity to score and Jason Baggot the unconverted experiment.
Climo cleared Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in mid-time, he scored a goal then did a single attempt to make Ayr score 17-5 on a break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's experiments changed by Baggot, reduced the odds to five points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruardh Knott suffered a serious injury, impeded out, and since the beginning of the match, Ayr drove faster than Stafford McDowall's experiments, changed by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was struck by a yellow card and again, Melrose made a backup player pay with an unalterable Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of the hard pressure.
The host has returned to play, however, by the time Struan Hutchinson gets a yellow card for turning Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrives behind Ayr's injured advance.
Climo was replaced, as it happened again, almost since the beginning of the match, after Kyle Rowe did a goal kick and thwarted Gregor Henry's fifth operator.
The star Still Game looks ready for his new career in the restaurant industry
The Star Still Game Kieran was seen ready to switch to the service industry after it was previously discovered that he was crowned the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56 - year - old Jack Jarvis on BBC popular events, directed and starring as well as his old comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The couple had announced that the ninth series to come was the last episode, and apparently Kiernan planned to guide the live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he's the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was trying to get involved in "the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
“ The sea is ours, Bolivia, surrounded by land, hoping that the court will open up again to the Pacific.
Sailors patrolled a large army headquarters located in La Paz.
The public building raised a blue sea flag.
The Navy base from Titicaca to the Amazon was polished with a motto: "The Sea is our rightful property.
To rise again is an obligation."
Passing through Bolivia surrounded by land, memories of the defeat of a shoreline to Chile in a 19th - century conflict remained as clear - as a desire to once again cross the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its peak in a few decades, since Bolivia waited for the court’s decree on October 1, after a five - year discussion.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and certainly a positive hope for the outcome," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who will watch the ICJ conference at large screens across the country, hoping that the courts in The Hague will support Bolivia’s claim that - after several decades of intense negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate a guarantee of Bolivia’s sovereignty over the oceans.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian president who faces a controversial war for next year's election - also has a lot of support on Monday's trial.
"We're very close to the return of the Pacific Sea," he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court can't possibly decide what Bolivia wants-- and that's only gonna change a little if it's possible.
The Dutch-based UN has no power to hand over Chilean territory, and it has determined that it will not decide the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the ICJ decree came only six months after the final argument was heard, indicating the case "not complex," said Paz Zárate, an international member of Chilean law.
And it's still far from continuing Bolivian demands, in the last four years it's likely to be a setback.
"The access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government by now," said the
Morales' aggressive retories have weakened both of Chilean citizens, he says.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will still negotiate, but it will be very difficult to keep discussing after this.
The two countries haven't switched ambassadors since 1962.
Ex-president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian government representative at The Hague rejected the idea of quick decision-making.
On Monday will give Bolivia "a great opportunity to open an era of relationship with Chile" and an opportunity to end 139 years of argument with mutual profit," she said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales is still one of Latin America's most famous presidents using the issue of maritime as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The affair is an opportunity to see what we need to solve in the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons acceleration won't happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never disarm a nuclear weapon if Korea couldn't trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday during the UN General Assembly.
He mentioned that the United States carried out a deal made at a meeting in Singapore between leaders who were competing with each other.
His comments appeared when the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to have almost begun nuclear diplomacy that had been dead-end for more than three months after meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said only a "simple dream" that by continuing the sanction and rejection of the U.S. on the declaration of the completion of the Korean War would make North Korea surrender.
Washington was on alert to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang making an effort to limit the armed forces first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there's a growing doubt that Pyongyang is earnest about the confession of the armory that for the country being the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
Paris fashion shows a huge collection of recent headgears up to the main road near you
If you want to multiply the collection of hats or really want to be protected from sunlight don't look for anything else.
Valentino and Thom Browne have issued a series of large-sized headgears for their SS19 collections on the fashion show stage with a stunning style held in Paris Fashion Week.
A completely impractical hat has swept Instagram this summer and these designers have shown a fascinating creation of the eyes on the show.
The outstanding thing of Valentino is a cream - colored hat decorated with a wide edge of fur that covers the model’s head.
Large accessories include watermelons decorated with diamonds, witch hats and even a pineapple, but not made to warm their heads.
Thom Browne also showed me a bunch of weird masks and right up to Halloween.
Many colorful masks have been sewn up and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than Haute Couture.
A creation that resembles a squabble submarine is equipped with snorkels and glasses, while others look like melted ice cream.
And if you keep going through that great collection of fashions-- then you're lucky.
Modern observers estimate that the large hat collection will be marketed to the main road near you.
Large-sized hats are a very good-selling trend in 'La Bomba', straw hats with two legs wide are seen wearing everyone including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label worship behind hats that are so impractical in the splashing of social media makes a huge creation in catwalks of straw that is almost the size of a bathing suit - worn with a limp model.
An orange bag burned, cut with a rafia on the side with a white handle, is the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19's Paris Fashion Week collection.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I hope to see a big hat and beachbag arrive on the main road for the next summer--because designers have made a huge impact, it will be difficult to ignore the request for such great accessories'
John Edward: Language skills are vital to global citizens
Scotland’s private school kept track of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with an extraordinary test results, which were strengthened by each student and a collective success in sports, art, music and hard work.
With over 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Council (SCIS) work hard to provide the best services for students and parents.
The school aims to prepare its students for further education and higher education, their chosen careers, and their role as citizens of the world.
As education sectors that can design and implement the school curriculum as expected, we see modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, your words will go into his head.
If you speak to him in his language then your words will go into his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's latest test, we can see that language is at the top of the league table with the highest grades in self-graduate schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn foreign languages get straight A plus.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools that show that 72 percent of students get an A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent who learn Spanish also get an A.
This shows that the school of self-sustaining Scotland supports foreign language as an important skill that children and adolescents will certainly need in the future.
Today languages, as a subject of choice, are held in the same standard as STEM (sains, technology, engineering and mathematics) in modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey conducted by the British Work Force and Skills found that for some reason the workers had to continue to struggle to fill the vacancy, 17 percent of the reasons for their lack of language skills.
Hence, language skills are further encouraged to prepare youths for their future careers.
With increased work opportunities in need of language skills, this skill is important in the global world.
Whatever a person’s career choices are, if they have learned a second language, in the future they will experience real benefits from having such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with the citizens of a foreign country will automatically make a multilingualist superior to the competition.
According to YouGov polls in more than 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to have French conversations and language become the only language spoken in two digits of percentages, which is 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for children today is important for the present.
Having a multilingual ability, especially the language of countries with developed economy, would provide children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school will teach a different language.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach English - considered most important languages for the next few years, 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest is, there will always be a number of available languages in a self - school, with an expert teaching staff in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are intended to provide learning environments that will prepare children and provide them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
There is no denying that today, in the global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so it should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered truly "international communication skills."
The self - centered school will continue to offer Scottish youths these choices, diversity, and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish School Board.
LeBron will be performing debuts for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Waiting for the fans to see LeBron James start his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season opening Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
Still, it hasn't been determined how many minutes he's going to play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six pre-summer game of Lakers.
"At my current career stage, I don't have to do pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Trump Public Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a general campaign meeting tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first public meeting of five public meetings scheduled for next week, including stops in some fun places covering Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was confirmed that the vote was postponed so that he could vote for the Supreme Court office, Trump intended to build support for his upcoming part-time election because the Republican Party risked losing Congress control if the vote was made on November.
What time is Trump's general meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's public meeting at Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 7:00 p.m. E. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's general meeting in West Virginia online via live YouTube.
It's possible Trump will discuss this week's trial for the candidate Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who is getting tensed after the charges of indecent sexual acts and estimates of the Senate vote will be delayed for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this general meeting is to help the Republicans gain some momentum in the face of the November elections.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign, it is stated that the next five public meetings are intended to "institute volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority that they hold in the Senate and the Parliament," according to Reuters.
"The Congressional Control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel as much as possible to the states as we can during our busy campaign season," Trump campaign spokesperson who refused to be named Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling, tonight's public meeting is expected to present supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and withdraw coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state he won with over 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, candidate for the West Virginia Senate of the Republican Party who was left behind in the polls.
"Not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come as an effort to improve his polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team marches on its hope in the face of a single Sunday match
After three one-sided sessions, a foursome Saturday afternoon session is probably what's needed in Ryder Cup.
A pendulum momentum swing is a concept of sport that the players fully trust, and there's nothing more than in competitions like this.
Where do they think momentum is right now?
"Before that, they're up by six points and now four, so I think we think of it as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he passed that day.
Surely Europe has the advantage of a four-point advantage with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth said, felt they had a little momentum and they had a lot of things to be excited about, no exceptions to Spieth and Justin Thomas' formations that played together all day and each boasted three out of four points.
Spieth has been playing deadlyly from the tee area to the green area and leading it by trade.
The clamoring cry is getting louder and louder by the time the turn comes, doing an important putting blow to make it a series when he and Thomas lose two against two.
The putting blow of him that won them at the 15 that were welcomed with a similar scream, the scream that tells you that he believes that America does not lose.
"You really should try harder and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
All these players are gone now.
18 holes that need to be marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas for the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of Ryder Cup.
The unique but interesting couple from Europe is four for four and can do no wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do a bagey punch on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seemed to flow both into or from this boisterous crowd that convinced them that they were players to be defeated on Sunday, and there was no player more famous than Fleetwood and Molinari who would lock the potential victory of Europe at sunset over Le Golf National.
It's better if at the same time they're both placed in different holes.
Yet, it is still too early to discuss European victories.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shortened Sergio Garcia's work, the morning four ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on a nine front like digging a hole that can never be climbed by these Spanish and Swedish golfers.
Although, on Sunday no one can help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are a good show to look closer to because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how strategy can change instantly.
So far, Europe played better as a team and led quite a long way to the final day, but foursome sessions also showed that the U.S. team had the courage to compete even if it was questionable by some, especially in the United States.
Europe excels 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will benefit from Ryder Cup's final day after rising from a fourball and foursome Saturday by leading 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to record their points so far at Le Golf National by four points.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to maintain an unattainable trophy in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong American team in the morning four ball, making this series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes, won two games, but they couldn't reduce deficits.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 single Sunday games to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debutante to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, were only the second couple to win four points of their opening match in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball they became very solid to defeat the frayed Woods and debutant American Bryson Dechbeau with a firmer 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally performed brilliantly but had already lost 19 of 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested on a fourball morning, then returned to pair with Henrik Stenson in foursome and lost 2&1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three worlds.
Europe didn't achieve it itself even though the day was pleasant and windy in southwest Paris.
The first three-time winner was Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measure for America at two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 victory which attracted Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in fourball then returned again to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome after losing the first two holes.
Just twice in the history of Ryder Cup where a team returned from deficit four points into a single game, even though as Furyk's team's defending champions only need a series point to maintain the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, the Sunday counterattack seemed to overtake them.
North Korea says it's impossible to disarm one-sided without any trust.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the sanctions are constantly deepening their distrust of the United States and there's no way that the country disarmed its nuclear weapons side by side in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho spoke to the annual General Assembly of the world's body that North Korea has taken "indicative steps that show good intentions" in the last year, like stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without faith in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there's no way we'll disarm ourselves on one side first."
While Ri repeated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington resistance on the "staged" approach to the denucation where North Korea would be punished for taking a gradual step, a significant statement was conveyed that they did not refuse completely as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the summit between the president of the United States and North Korean leaders who were first held in Singapore on June 12th, at which point Kim promised to work on the "deny of Korean peninsula" while Trump promised security of North Korea.
North Korea has wanted the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang has to stop the nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected the call to loosen the international heavy sanction on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increasing pressure by semi-induced sanctions to reach their destination by force, and even reject "the ultimate declaration of war," Ri says.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But, the problem is that these ongoing sanctions will deepen our distrust."
Ri didn't mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted leader of the United States at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister even highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the troubled parties in this denuclearization are South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not reach this kind of dead end."
Even so, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke to the UN General Congregation that targeting North Korean rockets on the continent of the United States was inevitable after the "Mr. Demon President" Trump called Kim " Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations meeting, Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea in total, commend Kim for his courage to take a step to disarm, but the big job was still to be done and the sanctions had to remain in effect until North Korea's denuclearing.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he didn't have a deadline for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter", he said.
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the taking of steps.
However, the U.S. Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, delivered to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The Enforcement of Security Council must continue with strictness and should not fail until we know that the complete denuclearization, final and verifiability."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to stop the funding of Pyongyang nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly side by side and said afterwards that he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that there's actually been progress, only North Korea in a matter of hours lashing out that she's making "excuse like a gangster."
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle missile sites and nuclear complexes if the United States took "the appropriate action."
He claims that Kim told him to do what he wanted to do was to secure the security Trump promised in Singapore and move towards the normalization of relationship with Washington.
Harvard students took a course about a good break.
A new course at Harvard University this year puts all S1 students there to sleep more, in an attempt against macho culture in learning that is developing through caffeine-powered owls.
Academics discovered that students at university number one of the world often don't know anything when it comes to very basic things about how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine specialist at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course, which he believed was the first of his kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start a course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
'In the end a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I being told now, in my senior year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleep--which surprised me,' she said to The Telegraph.
The first launched course this year, explaining to the students the essence of how good sleep habits help academics and athletics, and improving their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health care, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding students who were very sleep deprived all week.
This course of an hour involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there was an image of a dorm room, where students clicked on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation for the effects of caffeine and light, as well as how athletic results were affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of bedtime.
On the other hand, participants get an explanation of how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We knew this wouldn't change the student's behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have the right to know the effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health,' so did Prof. Czeisler.
The proud culture of 'adversity' is still there, he says, plus that modern technology and increasing pressure on students which means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure you sleep well, with good quality, must be a secret weapon against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain activate hunger mode, causing hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology that helped Professor Czeisler design the course, took one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes that all graduate students will be instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting the alarm for bedtime, as well as the wake-up alarm, and recognize the effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its system and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Emphasising Gerrard's men mentally
Again, the Rangers felt the sorrow of a long day during Dolly's attack delivered Steven Gerrard's team scattered to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Tim Hebox attempted to record their first victory on their journey, since the victory of 4-1 in February at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team had just given Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as managers, leaving his team eight points behind from the leader of the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Arguing to attack seven minutes before the first half is over and the out-of-the-book Rangers don't seem to be evening.
While the Rangers now descend to sixth position, Livingston ascends to third position, leaving only the score between Hibernian.
And there could be further problems in the Rangers' fortress after the Calum Spence line guards have to be treated for head injury after an object is thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that passed Ayr to the semifinal Betfred Cup.
On the contrary, Holt left with Livi the same 11 who took one point from the Hearts last week and he'd be happy with the costumes that fascinate their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may dominate the ownership of the ball, but Livingston uses the ball better.
They should've recorded the score in just two minutes when the first short bait threw Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's wicket, but the quarterback pulled the big opportunity too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep kick then met Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow can only stab wide in the rear position.
Rangers take control but there seems to be more hope than belief about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have got a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided at a quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected this Colombian national appeal.
Rangers only managed to throw two in the first half, but the former goalkeeper of Hebox, Liam Kelly, had hardly a problem with the head of Lasana Coulibaly and the easily tamed Ovie Eurara attack.
Even though Livi's 34th minute opening goal may be contrary to the course of the match, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
The Rangers once again failed to overcome the deep Jacobs deathball tactics.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher placed the ball on Scott Robinson, who stayed quietly choosing to stand up for the simple end.
Gerrard acted on a break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the turnout almost had a direct impact when the wing player put the ball on Morelos but Kelly was playing out of line quickly to intercept.
But Livingston continued to force the tag team to play exactly the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Hackett sweeping all the long balls.
Holt's team was supposed to widen their edge at the final stage but McGregor stood well to repel the Jacobs before Lithgow reached the wide end of the corner.
The Rangers' understudy Glenn Middleton claimed penalty again when he got into a fight with Jacobs, but then again Thomson turned his back on him.
Almanac: Geiger Grabper Finder · Global Voices
And now from our Sunday Morning Almanac page: September 30th, 1882, 136 years ago today, and MATCH will continue to grow... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was an invention that ultimately made the device known as the Geiger Scoundrel.
Being an expert on science ever since, Geiger counters have also been a popular pop culture, as in the 1950 "Bells of Coronado," starring cowboy scientists who don't seem convincingly convincing, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is that thing?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you use this earphone, you can actually hear the atomic effect released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, it's coming up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63th birthday.
But it's the invention that keeps his name alive.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to ‘recognize ’ evil cells
New cancer vaccine teaches immune systems to recognize evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach immune systems to identify evil cells as part of medicine
His methods involve extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the lab.
They can then recognize proteins that are common in many cancers and then be injected again.
An experimental vaccine showed promising results for patients of all kinds of cancers.
A woman was treated with that vaccine, which is what taught the immune system to recognize the evil cell, the ovarian cancer went missing for over 18 months.
This method involves the process of extracting the patient's immune cell, changing it in the lab so that they can "recognize" the protein that is generally found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Society of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "instigated the growth of some kind of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and coloractal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
The same approach as taking a patient's immune cell and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has succeeded in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing a Haga Hat, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was ridiculed in the studio for Saturday Night Live after she got into a mess where she praised the President of the United States Donald Trump and said that he was going to run for office in 2020.
After doing the third song that night, titled Ghost Town where he wore the Great Make America hat, he challenged the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"Once I talk to white people and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America for a long time," she said.
SNL started the show with a charade starring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's Judial Committee on claims of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the West curse tape was uploaded to social media by the Chris Rock comedian.
It's not clear if Rock is trying to make fun of West with that upload.
Besides, West complained to the audience that he was having a hard time backstage because of a worn hat.
"They hit me backstage.
They said, 'Don't come out wearing that hat.'
They hit me!
And then they say I'm drowning," she said, according to Washington Examiner.
West goes on: "You want to see the place sink?" says that he's going to wear Superman's robe, because that means you can't dictate what to do.
Try to love."
His comments produced at least twice the ridicule of the spectators and SNL characters looking embarrassed, Variety reports, with one person telling him: "The entire studio is silent."
West was brought in at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, ex-boyfriend rapper Mac Miller who just died a few days ago.
West confuses a lot of people with the performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West got the support of the conservative head of the TPUSA group, Candace Turner who tweeted: "For one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU HAVE BEEN APPRECIATE."
But the host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being himself and that was really very nice."
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art) that I believe embraces and regurgitates dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
So do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the creature officially known as Kanye West."
She's not the first artist to change her name and follow Diddy's footsteps, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and of course the late Prince's music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Star Game of Thrones Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for swing swords in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Games of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, contradicts macho hero stereotypes, he says that roles on such screens often make young boys feel that they must be strong to be respected.
Talked to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that something was wrong and questioned how to deal with the bad masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his gamer at the Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, claimed she felt strong enough to discuss the issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, at the moment--where did we go wrong in this masculinity thing?' she said.
'What do we teach men when we grow up, with regard to the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the emergence of bad masculinity with its highly masculine characters.
He continued: 'Which are the characters from birth and what are they taught?
What was taught on TV, and on the street, that made a boy feel that they had to have this particular side to be a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions in the moment-- how do we change it?
'Cause there's definitely something wrong with the youth.'
In that interview he also admitted that he wouldn't play in the prequel or sequel Game of Thrones when this series would end next summer, saying that he was done with the battlefield and the horses.
Since November Kit will star in the return of True West from Sam Shepard, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, who was a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting his wife Rose the best reason to get out of the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, so give me a family of the future, and from here my life begins' she said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the love flower of Kit's character is Jon Snow, in the fantasy series of Emmy's award winner.
The couple were married in June 2018 in the Scottish home of Leslie’s family.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% of new case surges
China has announced a 14% spike in its population living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are infected in this country, says the health worker.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking the change from before.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV people in this way has been reduced to nearly zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, over the years the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT people is called increasingly widespread.
Due to the conservative value of this country, studies estimate that 70 to 90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men will eventually marry women.
Many infectious diseases stem from the unaffected sexual protection of this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to handle the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that the staff leaked GOP's data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'.
The U.S. representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of his staff members had sent personal information of three U.S. Republican senators to the page of Wikipedia MPs.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party confirms that the claim was moved by experts and website "ultra-right wing".
"Lie, lie, and many more vile lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
It was reported that the released information included the home address and phone number of the United States Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
That information appeared online on Thursday, sent by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearing on charges of indecent sexual abuse against future Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
This leak appeared shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP address identifying the source of the shipment is connected to Waters' office and reveals the information of a member of Waters staff, Hill reports.
"This unfounded noise is completely wrong and is an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety are threatened by false and false accusations - are completely irresponsible for this leak of information.
This is certainly a false accusation".
Waters ’ statement quickly attracted online criticism, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This defense means anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests he's not fit to be a congressman.
If someone is accused of something that doesn't do it, they shouldn't be angry.
They must not deviate.
They should not question the accuser’s motives.
They'll be quiet and peaceful."
Fleischer showed up to compare Waters ’ reaction to Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the Thursday trial.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who was trying to move Waters to a part-time election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the right authority and entity of law enforcement on this false charge.
"We will make sure that the culprit will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions for one and all my staff members."
Johnny English Strikes Again's reviews-- Rowan Atkinson's lack of intelligence.
Currently searching for the significance of Brexit in every new film with British bias has become a tradition and it seems to apply to the re-emergence of the parody stunts Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would sarcasm be a sneer about how clearly we're becoming a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, the glare - eyed, rubber - faced, and incompetent Johnny English has updated his license to screw things up for the second time - his name gives more indication than anything that he is a vast comic creation designed for English cinema instead of English.
Surely he was a crazy secret agent who, in spite of his strange supposition, had a bit of a character of Clouseau, a little bit of a character of Mr Bean and a little bit of a wanderer who contributed a little bit to the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of London's 2012 Olympics.
In fact, he was based on an international tourist and mystery man who Atkinson had played in the barclaycard TV ad which is now forgotten, leaving chaos behind him.
There's one or two sweet moments on JE's newest trip.
I love it when Johnny English gets close to the helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor propellers quickly stick to his helmet.
Atkinson's prize for physical comedy was displayed, but his humor felt less powerful and too strange, especially when the brand of "serious" movies like 007 and Mission Impossible had confidence in entering comedy as material.
The humor feels like it's meant for children rather than adults, and for me strange Johnny English misfortunes are not as innovative and as focused on movies as Atkinson in Bean's personality.
The Premist who's been warm all these years is that England is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, exposing the identities of all British agents in the field, to disappoint agents on duty - unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for the proud and hostile prime minister, who's been completely ruined by his political popularity: Emma Thompson played a very good role in the character quasi-Tresa-May but not much to be done with the script.
His intelligent advisor gave information that since every active spy has been weakened, he must bring one out of retirement.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English guy himself, is now employed as principal at some fancy building, but giving a secret lesson on how to do undercover operations: there are some great jokes here, when English offers a spy academy like School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency briefing and reunited with a long-suffering old friend named Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a shitty high-ranking female role where Vicki Pepperdine is slightly knocked out.
So Batman and Robin made a mistake with His Majesty's Secret Service back in action, meeting the mysterious beauty Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is worrying about falling under the influence of a charismatic billionaire technology that claims to solve the problem of the British computer: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they burned French fast-food restaurants; they created chaos by smuggling themselves onto Volta's luxury ships; and English triggered anarchy when he tried to use Virtual Reality headsets to familiarize with Volta's interior.
All stops are certainly drawn to the last sequence, but with such hospitality and chaos, there's a bit of a kid's TV channel that's filled with everything.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And like any other Johnny English movie, I can't help thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that's totally suited to his talent?
The laborers denied planning for the British to work four days a week but were paid five days
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labor Union considered a radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week - but paid five days.
The union is reported to want company owners to continue saving results through a revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) for workers by giving them extra days off.
He'll let the employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get paid the same.
Some sources say that the idea will be "pas" with the party's economic agenda and the plan encourages the country to support the workers.
The fourth day of the week transition has been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
One source, which is the senior labor union saying to The Sunday Times: 'The gunships of this policy are expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'This won't happen overnight, but four days a week's work is an aspirations that fit the party's approach to rebalance the economy that supports workers and the whole party industry strategy.'
The Labor Party was not the first to support the idea, since the Green Party had promised four days of work a week on the 2017 election campaign.
However, it is currently not supported by the entire Labor Party.
The labor party spokesperson said: 'Four working days a week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labor Conference last week to perfect his vision for the economic socialist revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the anonymous director and the painters at the utility company.
This shadow chancellor plan also means that current shareholders in drinking water companies may not get their entire stock back because the labor party government can do less for reasons of offenses.
He also made sure that his plan was to put workers on boards and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company equity in the private sector to employees, who would pocket the annual dividends by £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their view.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his nomination in the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question whether this bureau's findings could affect the senators of the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senator, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his South Carolina partner.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told you to attend the trial, I told you, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charge came up, and said, 'You did it?'
He's a strong, determined, firm man."
However, it seems that Graham's voice cannot be changed.
"My mind has made up its mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs a bigger charge to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but what I do know is that Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentioned his name couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has this event Done Something to Reduce Poverty?
On this Saturday, New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that features a very impressive array of stars, and a mission that also works; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be witnesses of tens of thousands of people coming in droves to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the purpose of this show which is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Government Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get free tickets for the event (unless you want to pay the VIP ticket), concert visitors have to complete a series of tasks or "actions" like volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or other means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal for the past 12 years?
Is the idea of giving free concerts the right way to get people to do things, or is it just another case called "clicktivism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said to have recorded over 19 million "actions" of its supporters, encouraging to set other goals.
It is said that this action has helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, this group had gathered 390 commitments and announcements coming from their actions, at least $10 billion of which had been distributed or carried out.
The group estimates that safe funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in England made up of investors and executors committed to "helping children grow to their maximum potential," promise to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like yourself, we can make social injustices on this nutritional record into footnotes in history," ambassadors The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve nutrients for mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funds for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions on the General Ask on their website that asks "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "This will be a long, difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite, we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekly, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the stars performing on this year's New York show, which will be guided by Debra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as "blockade" to inhibit the export of Russian energy - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington can request the Navy's help to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State, Ryan Zinke reveals, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspected that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, in place of operating on a legitimate government invitation - was an excuse to explore the new energy market.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to be energy brokers, just like they do in Eastern Europe, south of Europe," he reported.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure open ocean lines, and, if necessary, to do blockades, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the event participants held by the Consument Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the "energy customer voice" in the U.S.
He compared Washington's approach to a deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they're the same.
"The economic choice in Iran and Russia is more or less, harnessing and replacing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as one of the "the experts in that field" with the economy dependent on fossil fuels.
This statement appeared when Trump's government representatives were on a mission in order to increase their export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper choice for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, tried to persuade the Germans to withdraw from the Moscow "unsuitable" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which Trump said made Berlin a "rescue".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 oil mill project is worth $11 billion, designed to double the capacity of the oil pipeline that exists up to 110 billion cubic feet [110 billion cubic meters], is pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's violent resistance to this project is merely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same view that energy can't be used as a tool to perform pressure and that customers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said the Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after meeting with the US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This U.S. attitude has pulled a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization Federation of Germany Industries has asked the U.S. not to interfere in the European Union’s energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would face a major problem if the third country interfered with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, chief Federation of German Industries after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will observe the situation as President of 2020, says Senator Massachusetts.
On Saturday, Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said that she would look at the situation while running for president after a part-time election.
While campaigning at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and improve our debased government, including putting women at the top," as he said to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will take a closer look at the situation of running for president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning at city hall, saying that he "took this area in the wrong direction.
"I was so worried about what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren's being blunt in his criticism of Trump and the future head of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s own constituency did not want him running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the voters in Massachusetts say the senator should not run for office, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent of those who support the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run for office, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of running for office and 48 percent against it.
Other important names in the Democratic Party are discussed regarding the possibility of running in 2020 including former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll decide officially in January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin quoted PTSD Track Palin during Donald Trump's campaign.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in Sept.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's going through on his return, I can connect with other families who have also experienced the consequences of PTSD and some injuries that our soldiers have suffered," he said in front of the audience who were present at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest like "gassed in the room" and told him about his son and other war veterans, "they came back a little different, they came back a little harder, they went back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and airmen and every other military member to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault abuse against a woman, coupled with reports of domestic violence and possession of a drunken weapon, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge to a new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support legal challenges to new U.S. policies that reject asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts filed friends-of-the-court briefings on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenge the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the accuser Grace v. In the session lawsuit raised by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has yet to be revealed.
He said his partner "and his son who was a violent gang member," had abused him, but the U.S. officials rejected his request for asylum on July 20th.
He's being held in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produced large applications of asylum for the U.S., as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The U.S. new asylum policy is contrary to the 2014 Immigrant Council’s decision that allows illegal immigrants to flee domestic violence to file asylums.
Attorney General District of Columbia, Karl Racine says in a statement on Friday that this new policy "disregards state, federal, and international laws that have been around for decades."
"The federal law requires that all claims of asylum should be decided based on facts and circumstances related to those claims, and such prohibitions violate the principle," friends-of-the court briefing said.
The D.A. has given a brief opinion that the policy against immigrants infiltrating the U.S. economy, saying that most likely they'll be businessmen and "employee workers are necessary."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered an immigration judge not to give asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang cruelty.
"Supports are available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to racial, religious, national, or membership in certain social groups, or political opinions," the Sessions said in this policy announcement on June 11.
The Sanctuary is not meant to ease all problems -- although all problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue attempt in Palu because the victim doubled as he raced with time to find survivors
For those who survived, the situation worsened.
"It's very tense," said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, calms her baby boy who was grieving at the refugee center in the devastated Palu city.
"Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
Clean water is rare."
Citizens were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up waterlogged goods, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, damage caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, very messy.
Some of those injured, including the Two Haris, who suffered spinal fractures and shoulders, were lying outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the room because of strong aftershocks.
Her tears flowed back to her feelings when the earthquake shook her fifth-floor hotel room where she stayed with her wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I'm stuck in the ruins of the wall," Haris said to the Associated Press, he added his family to the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then silent.
I don't know how he is or my son.
May they survive."
The U.S. ambassador accused China of being intimidated by a propaganda advertisement.
A week after the Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that called the mutual profit of the U.S.-Tongkok trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday was referring to China Daily's pay supplement at Des Moines Registers - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to intervene in the U.S. Congress election on 6th Nov., an accusation against China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the U.S. elections, which marks what U.S. officials are saying to Reuters, is a new phase in the increase in campaign that Washington is doing to suppress China.
Although it's common for foreign governments to put advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now shackled in a growing commercial war, which makes them raise the rate of imports to each other.
The Chinese retaliation at the beginning of this trade war was designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa who support the Trump Republican Party, says Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, major exporters of agricultural goods to China, says Beijing has cost workers, farmers, and business men in America.
China, Branstad wrote an opinion on Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now double the intimidation by running propaganda ads on our own free media."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the freedom of speech and freedom of press that was highly valued in America by holding a payable ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, at street news vendors' stalls here, in Beijing, you'll find restrictions on different voices and will not see the real reflection of the different opinions that China might have on China's troubled economic trajectory, considering that the media is under the control of the Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent media in China refused to offer to publish" his article, although he didn't mention which newspaper.
Analysts Alert, Republican Party Avoids Women's Selections Toward Part-Time with Kavanaugh Disasters
Because the important people of the Republican Party are standing up and defending the future leader of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of some sexual assault charges, analysts have warned that they will see counterattacks, especially from women, on the upcoming part-time elections.
Emotions over this matter are very high, and most Republicans have been noted that they want to move forward to vote.
It can't be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said she doubted the Senator's urge (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake at the last minute to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to ease anger on the voters.
"Girls won't forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and a national spokesperson for the progressive group of MoveOn said it on Friday, according to Washington newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators shouted "November is near!" as they protested in the Senate hallway when the Republicans controlled the Justice Committee to continue in Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"The enthusiasm and democratic motivations will be off the list," non-Stu Rothenberg political analysts, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among the women's voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony explained in detail the sexual abuse of him by the future head of the Supreme Court, analysts advised a counterattack that followed if the Republican Party continued to push him forward with confirmation.
"It's been a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the election committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans handle this problem and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Prioritys, a group that helps to vote for the Democratic Party, points to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be splitting up about who to trust after the testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, with a choice that's a little more favourable to the last.
A new poll conducted by YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents actually believed or perhaps believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they actually believed in or perhaps believed in Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh might or actually lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh drunk had attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez said that the future head of the Supreme Court showed him his cock when they attended a party while they were in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Discoverers Planning to Start a New Internet for Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup trying to rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company built from the platform open source Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the intention behind the Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from the startup.
"This is an historic moment."
It uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal data storage" or POD.
This store may contain contacts, tasklists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available at one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about this personal online data storage is that it's absolutely up to users who can access what kind of information.
The company is known as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of setting up Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce's company, is for companies to present resources, processes, and skills appropriate to help make Solid available to everyone.
This company is currently made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several staff developers contracted for project work, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team didn't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not it would introduce or not a total change in which all of their business models would actually be reversed overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post in Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt missions are to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the neutrality of network debates.
Even when launching the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next web age," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: alerting WW1 scholars Victoria Cross
The only Church scholar in England who won Victoria Cross during World War One as a warrior, was warned in her homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for the attack on Bellenglies and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had won the highest British military honor.
A warning stone was inaugurated by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "intelligent symbol" stone that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's achievements winning the award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29th, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through the thick fog under a series of shootings from field guns and machines."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with "the greatest courage" led the front before rushing to use the field guns alone and paralyzing three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I wouldn't be able to live but it was a very humble act."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a bouquet after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to participate in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many will give."

Imagine this, you've been up all night watching a crowded Bellator 206 just to be turned down to watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is live all night on the British Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in England was stunned when the coverage turned into Pappa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they stay up all night especially for the fight.
A Twitter fan describes changing children's cartoons as "disgusting jokes."
"It's a government rule, that at 6 a.m. the content is not suitable for air, so it's replaced by a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and Bellator communication, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa the Pig," yes."
The president of Scott Coker's company said that they would improve their scheduling by taking into account future audiences in England.
"I think, if we think about rebooting, I think we might be able to work it out," says Coker.
"But it's six in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday when we are, on Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, at the turn around, there's a lot of texts going back and forth and they're all uneducated.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical error.
No, it's a government matter.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce to five fights from six fights-- like we usually do-- and we're going to try to avoid over-showing fans, and we're going to succeed.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Tom Daley feels low self-esteem related to sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with low self-esteem due to his sexuality problem - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't notice until he entered high school, that "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs brought by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights to give people hope.
He also said being a parent makes him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of events, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off from illness.
Being the one who got knocked out of Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less compared to" all the other people who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like men and women."
He said, "Till this day, those feelings are less than the others, and feelings have become evident that has given me strength and strength."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let everyone down when they found out about his sexuality problem.
These two Olympic bronze medalists have become famous LGBT campaigners and have used their appearance at Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and to give hope to others.
This three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man - a filmmaker from U.S. Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprises me."
Daley married an Oscar who was 20 years older than her last year, and she said age gap wasn't a problem.
"If you have so many problems at a very young age" - he entered his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who had the same ups and downs.
This couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "the whole perspective" had changed.
"If you ask me last year, everything around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are bigger things than winning Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as Robert’s father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had gotten tickets to the 2012 London Olympics-- because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'you won't sit in the front row of dad'," he said.
"I held her hand as she stopped breathing and still hadn't really stopped breathing until she died, I finally admitted that she was invincible," she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I've dreamed of all my life -- to dive in front of a crowd at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that," she said.
It also inspired his first song selection--Proud by Heather Small-- which was already fused with him in preparation for the Olympics and still gives him the creeps.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast that was broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed roles when proposed to Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to change roles to avoid unpleasant achievements.
Mickelson, who played the two-year show to record the 12th record, was recommended by Captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball game and group of four on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually does for the United States, this five-time main winner divides his time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on that range, hoping to improve what he's been up to.
Never was a straightest golfer despite being at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man was not fit to take a very strict course at Le Golf National, which routinely imposed a long and harsh punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own pitch, it wasn't scary enough for Mickelson, in his ninth game on Sunday, to face the very accurate Open England champion Francesco Molinari, who had been working with the newcomers of Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American golfer, starts 12 single games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then the Mickelson game will prove to be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understands his role today, patting my back and embracing me, and saying he'll be ready for tomorrow's match," said Furyk.
"He's so confident.
He's the Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined everything else, but that's how it was played, and that's the way we thought we had to go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game on Sunday.
It could mark the end of his career in Ryder Cup that would never match the height of his individual record.
Mickelson pocketed 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven seriess, even though Furyk said his presence brought some things he couldn't say to the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he's making fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players are having fun with it, this week too, which is quite fun to see.
He's given a lot more than just playing."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knew great superiority could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, learned from experience that someone who led him large enough to his last single match in Ryder Cup could easily have been an unpleasant journey.
Dane did his first debut at a game in 1997 in Valderrama, with the captain of the Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point advantage over America, but just touched the finish line with their noses with the thinst margin, winning 141⁄131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we're getting great advantages in Valderrama; we get great advantages in Brookline, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we win, but just now," said Bjorn, taking pictures, after watching Class of 2018, win 5-3 good on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you will enter a really boring match.
Come out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get a point on the board.
We have a target, and that target is winning this trophy, and that's the focus.
I've been saying, I've been focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're also very aware of what's on the other side -- the greatest players in the world."
It's nice to see the players play on the hard golf course, Bjorn adds: "In this case I'll never go forward on my own.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, the individual players are going forward, and this is a different thing to do.
It's really nice to be out there with a partner if everything goes well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your skills as a golfer will be tested.
That's the message you have to deliver to all the players, take out the best of yourself for tomorrow's match.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best of him."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his players to play better individually than they do as yapins, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the final day of the big game, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before ending up with defeat when Europe did "The Miracle of the Mediterranean."
"I remember every word of it," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, brought his players together to the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start quickly as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When momentum goes one way, it'll put a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We also set up a list of players and put people in different ways that we think, you know, we're trying to perform a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the resistance against Rory McIlroy at the top of the game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players at the top.
"I went with this group of people in sequence like this because I thought I could shut down all the roads," Bjorn said about his single choice.
The new German battleship is suspended
The new German Navy guard ship should have started working in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but it won't be there until at least next year because of the wrong system and rising costs, local media reports.
The task of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of Baden-Wuertmberg's new class guard, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman.
This ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post-transmit problem had disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four marine-ordered Baden-Wuertmberg class ships in 2007 will come in exchange for the old Bremen class guard ship.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as radar erasers, infrared, and acoustic locks.
Another important feature includes a longer period of treatment - should be possible to use the newest bodyguard for two years away from its original port.
However, the delay constantly means this sophisticated warship - which is said to allow Germany to highlight its power abroad - will wear out by the time it begins to enter its service, Die Zeit records.
The notorious F125 guard ship was made public last year, when the German Navy officially refused to assign the ship and returned it to the shipyard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned ships to shipbuilders after delivery.
Few reasons are known behind the return of the ship, but the German media quotes a significant amount of "disfigured software and hardware" that renders the battleship useless if used for combat missions.
The defect of software is very important because Baden-Wuretmberg class ship will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the labor force on the older Bremen class of warships.
It is also known that the ship is overweight that will reduce its performance and limit its Navy ability to add future updates.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with 7,000 tons of weight this is believed to weigh twice as much as the ship with the same class that Germany used in World War II.
Besides broken hardware, the production cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also a problem.
It's said to be a surprise rise to £3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - rising from the beginning of euro2.2 billion.
The problem that binds this latest guard ship has become very important considering the latest warning due to a shrink in German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament defense committee admitted that the Navy was actually "out of the ship with the ability to spread."
The official said that as time went on, the old ships were no longer used, but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuettmberg class ships could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to bat's secret life in secret.
New research was done on a farm on the Highlands of Scotland that aims to uncover how bats use landscapes in their hunting for food.
It is hoped that this discovery will provide new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
This study by scientists at National Trust for Scotland will follow the common peetrelle and soprano bats and long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also do cellular surveys using mobile detectors.
The sound experts who analyze all the recordings will confirm the frequency of call bats and species in which to engage in what activity.
Then maps and reports of habitats will be made to create images on a landscape scale detailing their behavior.
Rob Dehr, the natural conservation advisor for the NTS, hoped this result would reveal which area of habitat is most important to bats and how each species uses it.
This information will help determine what benefits come from habitat management work such as grassland production and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout England have dropped sharply in recent centuries.
This bat is threatened with construction and development work that affects nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper hung to trap bats and chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Actually bats aren't blind.
Because of his hunting habits at night, however, his ears are more useful than his eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo - location techniques to locate insects with precision and barriers in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, are deeply concerned about bats.
Have ten well - trained men, who regularly survey, check the nest, and sometimes rescue efforts.
It has also established the first and only reserve in Scotland on Threave farms in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson said the plantation was a suitable area for bats.
"Here in Threave, we have a nice area for bats," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, lots of old trees, and all the good habitats.
However, there's still a lot of things we don't know about bats, so the work that we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to develop."
He stressed the importance of the bat examination before doing maintenance in the property, because there was no indication that the destruction of one birth nest could kill up to 400 female bats and a small one, which would probably wipe out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and killed, harassing, or disturbing, or destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Conservation of Bat Trust, has encouraged the public to join in.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species that we don't yet know about the fate of their population."
Ronaldo who refuses rape claims is setting up lawyers to sue German magazines.
Cristiano Ronaldo calls rape claims on him as "false news," and says that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Majorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was then suspected to have paid for it by giving $3375,000 to keep his mouth shut about this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Talked in an Instagram live video to 142 million of his followers a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they're saying today is false news," the winner of the Ballon d'Or five times this says it to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's attorneys are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel on the charge, which they call a "report of suspicion in the unacceptable field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said he would ask for compensation as "the moral damage in proportion to the weight of the offense, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in the last few years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga reported back to the player’s room, where he supposedly raped her, according to a report filed at the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga said Ronaldo was on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a "good man" who disappointed just "one percent."
The document says that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sex, but it was based on mutual desire.
The majorga also said he went to the police station and had done a visum for his injuries at the hospital, but then agreed to settle the matter outside the court because he was afraid of getting revenge and worried about being humiliated in public.
This 34-year-old woman says now she's trying to undo the settlement because she's constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the giant Italian Juve club with the 100 million euro deal.
Brexit: England will “repent forever” for the loss of car makers.
The English would regret forever if they lost their status as leader of the world as a car manufacturer after Brexit, says Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
He added a "about" Toyota, England has told the BBC that if England gets out of the European Union without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car maker said the impact of border delays if there's no deal, would cost Brexit in terms of work expenses.
The factory in Burnaston - which made Auris and Avensis production of Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year that 90% were exported throughout the European Union.
"My opinion is that if the British leave the European Union at the end of March, we'll see a cessation of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British auto manufacturers have expressed their concerns about the escape from the European Union with no agreement on how cross - limits trade will run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close down the Mini factory at Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem associated with what the car makers said was the risk of supply chains if there was no deal with Brexit.
The production of Toyota is run based on the principle of timely production, with parts that go in every 37 minutes both from suppliers in England and the European Union for cars made in order.
If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29th, there may be a border disturbance, which according to industry can cause tardiness and a lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's supply at his factory in Derbyshire, said corporate representatives, and thus production would be stopped.
Clark says that the plans for the future Chequers Theresa May relationship with the European Union are "calibrated correctly to avoid inspection at the border."
We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I'm saying not only to enjoy success at this point, but to achieve this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4.
"It's not just from Toyota but other producers, too, that we really should be able to continue what's been a supply chain that's been running very well."
Toyota can't say how long the production will be stopped, but clearly in the long run, it warns that the increase of costs will reduce the power of the factory and will eventually be harmful in terms of work costs.
Peter Tsouvallas, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union manager of Unite at the factory, said the members are already getting worried: "In my experience, once this job is off, it will never come back again.
The government spokesperson said: "We have proposed a reasonable and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein will probably get delayed, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein can be delayed in a week because the battle for the next grand court leader Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House says on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian intervention in general elections, relations between Trump and Russia's assistants, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has been triggering rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using a telegram to record conversations with Trump and possibly depose the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of a report that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he was going to "choose not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate justice committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both will testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week on the claim against Kavanaugh, which, in turn, delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, is on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting was not fixed, so in a week's time, I can see that reversing it to another week is also good considering the other things that happened in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I've always wanted to deliver an update to the press."
Some journalists would oppose that statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that meetings aren't rare because they don't like TV journalists "who try to attract attention," though, he says: "I don't agree with the fact that they're trying to attract attention."
Then he proposed a direct contact between Trump and the press.
"President conducts more direct questioning sessions than the previous president," he added with no mention of evidence: "We've seen the numbers."
Meetings are still going on, Sanders says, but "If the press has a chance to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been doing it more often and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it'll replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly asks questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting high officials.
solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably show you why, perform free appearances and sometimes weird before the press gathers.
The secretary of health wrote a letter to European Union workers in Scotland’s NHS regarding Brexit’s concerns
The Secretary of Health has written a letter to the staff of the European Union working in Scotland NHS to express their gratitude and hope that they will still be working here after Brexit's problem.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until England withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to fulfilling the cost of filing permanent status for citizens of the European Union who are working at the transferred public service.
In her letter, Miss Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between England and the European Union have continued on this withdrawal, approaching the expected decision this fall.
But the British government is also prepared for possible scenarios of no agreement.
I know this must be very disturbing for all of you.
That's why now I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions each member of the staff has made, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union, and others, brought valuable experiences and skills that strengthened and increased health care work, and benefited the patients and communities we served.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie's having an emergency operation after a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers' quarterback, Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after a head injury at a 31-27 defeat of Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennesse reports.
Coach head of the state of Tennessee, Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before the scene ended.
"He came to the sidelines and collapsed there," said Reed.
The coach and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting it on the stretcher and brought him in for further evaluation.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds that there's been no details of the type of injury yet, and the state of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury happened.
Abercrombie, this second-rate red coat student, was in his first season with the state of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He got a total of five nickels on Saturday before he got out of the game, which made his balls total during this season 18 nickels.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher field price if they buy property in England
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher rates when they buy property in England, along with extra money that will be used to help the homeless according to Tory's new plan
This move will withstand Corbyn's success rate in attracting young voters
The rising fee of this field will be charged to those who don't pay taxes in England
The Finance Department estimates it will collect up to £120 million a year- to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will wear higher customs when they buy property in England - and additional money that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This step will be seen as an effort to withstand the success rate of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts in attracting young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high income.
An increase in tax fees will be imposed on individuals and companies that don't pay taxes in England, along with extra money that encourages the Government's efforts to fight homeless people.
The additional cost - which is an additional cost at present rate, including a higher level that was introduced two years ago to the second house purchase and the purchase of a house for rent - can be up to three percent.
The Finance Department expects this movement to go up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built property in London was purchased by non-English residents, which led to a rise in prices and made it increasingly difficult for the first buyer to set foot on the residential stairs.
Many of the rich areas of this country - usually in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the many foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for a cutout to help more young people have their first home.
He accused a large construction company of maintaining high property prices by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to ignore the quotas for affordable homes to repair the "hush housing" in England.
Corbyn has announced a series of interesting housing reform proposals, including rent surveillance and ending the "no guilt" disposal.
He also wanted to give the board greater power to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I promised I would dedicate the prime minister's office to restoring England's dream-- that life should be better for every generation.
And that means fixing our poor housing market.
England will always be open to those who want to stay, work, and build life here.
However, it is not appropriate for individuals who do not live in England, as well as foreign - based companies, to buy homes as easily as any British population has worked hard.
For many people the dream of having a home becomes something very far away, and indecent treatment of the homeless remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambisi is to lead the Scottish team'
Boss Sunderland, Jack Ross said his "primary ambition" was to become a Scottish manager at some stage.
This 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently ranked third in League One, between three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to Scotland's Premier League last season.
"I want to defend my country as a player.
I get a B hat and that's it, " Ross says to Sportssound, BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up and watched a lot of Scottish teams in Hampden with my father as a child, and it was always something that attracted me to return.
But that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
The manager of Sunderland before Ross was among Dick Advocaut, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former boss said he wasn't afraid to follow the trail of great names in such a large club, after having previously refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, current success will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities that are in this club, there is no doubt about being in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to be there, but I'll probably just see myself as a successful man here, if I can get this club back there."
Career Ross in team management just three years after some time as an assistant boss at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coach staff at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to third, and turned St. Mirren from the chasm of degradation into the championship champion of the next season.
And Ross says he's now more comfortable than he's ever been in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academically.
"This may be the crossroads I have to go through," he recalls taking over Alloa.
"I'm absolutely sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I'm fine, making a living in a normal way, and enjoying some natural things.
But play can be difficult.
You have a lot to go through every week.
I still experience it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable feeling I've ever felt in my adult life."

Survey found the right time for a beer drink is 5:30 on Saturday.
Summer waves have increased the income of pubs in England that are struggling to survive, but more is putting pressure on the restaurant network.
The numbers show, pub and bar groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurant income dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant, who composed those numbers, said: "The sun is blazing and British participation in the World Cup longer than expected means, July will follow the same pattern as in June, where pub income increases by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that get hit hard.
The drop of 1.8 percent of the restaurant trade in June will get worse in July.
The sale of pubs and bars that sell drinks so far has been more powerful than what happened at the restaurant that went down.
Pubs that sell food also suffer because of the heat of the sun, although not as severe as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just go out for drinks.
Sales all over the pubs and manageable bars that sell drinks up 6.6 percent for this month, with food sales down by three percent."
Paul Newman, recreational analyst and RSM hospitality said: "This results continue the trend we've seen since April.
Weather and the impact of a large social or sports event remain the biggest factor in selling outside the home market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 - percent decline in sales over the years would be very painful over the current cost pressures.
Long summers shouldn't come when operators who sell food are having a bad time, and time will tell us if the temperature we've had in August will give us a little bit of needed rest."
The total growth of sales throughout pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, is 2.7 percent in July, showing slowing down on brand launch.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they're hiding from their parents.
Surveys revealed that one in five children - some 11 years old - had a secret social media account they had hidden from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the development of "false Insta" page.
This news has increased concern about posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "primary" account to show parents
One in five children - some of them 11 years old - make social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid development of the "false Insta" account - a reference to the photo sharing site on Instagram.
The news has increased the concern of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they're operating a cleared "primary" account to show parents, while also have a personal account.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager who asked someone else to "rape me."
Research conducted by British Digital Consciousness and the Principal's Conference of Men and Women's Head (HMC) from independent schools, found 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep personal accounts.
Head HMC, Mike Buchanan says: "It interferes with so many teenagers trying to create online space that their parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes at the Scottish Athletic Council.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletic Council as the non-equipped director of the annual board meeting.
Doyle is a Scottish track and field athlete most highly honored and the chairman of Ian Beattie describes this movement as a great opportunity for those who are leading the sport to benefit from his international experiences over the last few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world athletic community and we believe athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him on board," said Beattie.
Doyle says: "I act as a voice for athletes and I hope to really contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
The American athletic athlete, who won the 200 meter and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among four Olympic gold medals and is now a BBC expert, is now unable to walk after a brief ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "Today I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I can't walk.
The doctor said that only time will determine if I can recover and to what degree of recovery it will be.
It is a very tiring job to recover fully, to learn how to walk again, and to do this day’s dexterity exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump commercials that compare mothers to cows have split their opinions online
The breast - pumping company has split opinions online with an ad that compares breast - feeding mothers to milked cows.
To mark the launch of a product that is said to be "a breast pump that can be used with the world's first silence," Elvie consumer technology company released an inspired ad from a video music joke to show the freedom this new pump gave to express a mother.
Four mothers danced in a barn with cow straw following a song that included lyrics like this: "Yes, I did flush myself, but you didn't see the tail" and "If you don't notice it's not a float, it's my tits."
And it goes on with the refrain: "Pumps out, pumps out, I feed them baby, pump out, pump out, pump out, I milk my woman."
However, the ads that have been published on the company’s Facebook page have caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, this video has received a variety of reactions from viewers, with many people saying it makes a "gamage" in the dairy-works industry.
"A very bad decision using cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless the baby is stolen from them within days of giving birth," wrote someone.
Elvie's breast pump fits perfectly in the breast-feeding bra.
Another comment: "An understandable trauma for both mother and baby.
But why not use it to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have to look after their babies?"
The other adds: "An ad missing meaning."
Someone else defended the ad, with a woman admitting that she found the song "funny."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still breastfeeding.
Blackmailing makes me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad was a little crazy, but I accepted it as it was.
It's a genius product," somebody wrote.
Others commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who squeeze and who feel like "cow."
It's neither ads that praise nor judge the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with hidden pumps tucked inside their bras.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the insights of many women who milk themselves saying they feel like cows.
However, Elvie Pump was really quiet, no wires or tubes and right inside the breastfeeding bra, which gave women the freedom to move, to hold their baby, and even to go out blackmailing.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "The Elvie Pump is a decent pioneer product to launch with conviction and provocation.
By comparing the description of women and milk cows, we want to pump breast milk and all its challenges, and by way of comforting and pleasantness to the full freedom presented by the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
On the London Fashion Week, a mother with two children appeared on catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski by using this product.
Hundreds of Migrants Moved Quietly to Tent Tent Camp in the Texas Border
The number of migrant children who were arrested is increasing even though the monthly border crossing remains unchanged, partly the result of the harsh statements and policies introduced by Trump's government that make it difficult to raise children with sponsors.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are documentless immigrants, and fear of endangering their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to save children.
The risk was increasing in June, when the federal government announced that the future sponsors and other adult members of the household had to hand over fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration governments.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in Immigration and Customs, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsoring an underage child.
The Society then made sure that 70 percent of those arrested had no record of crime.
"Almost 80 percent of the people sponsoring or sponsorizing members of the sponsorship are in this country illegally, and most of them are evil strangers.
That's why we keep hunting those people," says Mr. Albence.
Aiming to process children faster, officials introduced new rules that required some of them to appear in court within a month of being arrested, not after 60 days, which became the previous standard, the shelter workers said.
Most of them appear by video conference calls, not directly, to plead their legal status to immigration judges.
Those who are deemed unworthy of help will be immediately deported.
The longer the children are arrested, the more likely they are to be anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape efforts, the speech of shelter workers and systems reports received in the last few months.
Lawyers say it increases in larger facilities like Tornillo, whose marks are on a child who struggles to be ignored, because of its size.
They say that moving children to camp towns without providing enough time for them emotionally or saying goodbye to their friends can make the trauma worse.
Syria is calling for troops occupied from the U.S., France and Turkey to retreat immediately.
Adopting in the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops occupied Syrian soil illegally, for the reason of combating terrorism, and "will be handled properly."
"They must retreat immediately and without filing any terms," he revealed to the assembly.
Moualem asserts that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 36,000 people have been killed since 2011, with over millions of people fleeing their homes.
He confirmed that Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until we rid Syria of the terror groups and "the presence of illegal foreign soldiers."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, particularly training and affecting Syrian Kurds and Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in war - torn territory.
On the matter of refugees, Moualem insisted that they return immediately, and he blamed "some western countries" for spreading extraordinary fears that drove the refugees further away.
"We have asked international society and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They're politicalizing what should be a matter of total humanity."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no aid in reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the latest treaty between Russia and Turkey to establish buffer zones in the last large fort of Idlib rebels has resulted in the opportunity to continue political talk.
A treaty between Russia and Turkey prevented a massive attack from Russia's supported Syrian forces in that province, where there were three million people left.
But, Moualem asserted that the treaty had a clear "time gap" and gave rise to the hope that military action would target mujahids including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, which "will be cut off."
The UN envoy Stafffan de Mistura hopes to quickly hold the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to make post-war laws for Syria and open the way to elections.
Moualem displayed the terms of Syrian government participation on the committee, emphasizing that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the latest chapters of the Act," and warned against intervention.
Why Trump Will Win Second Period
According to that logic, Trump is going to win another election in 2020 except, because many liberal audiences are hopeful, prosecution and scandal ending his president early.
No one doubts, "The most dramatic end of the president ever!"
Until now, there's been no sign of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN’s main clock rating has doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC has almost tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the cable ratings by 3.5 million spectators on the main news night.
"It's the spirit that attracts people because it's something that's not understood," said Neal Baer, who hosted the ABC drama "Designated Survival," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed The Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: and some Hard Truths In Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," had another theory.
He remembered taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd give Trump his vote.
Why, he asked.
"She says, "Because she makes me laugh," Miss Scavell told me.
There's a sense of entertainment in chaos.
Surely, unlike any other show on TV, the plot from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can unite and restore the global economy.
Instead of that, the luxury that only the most privileged audience can experience.
Even so, not only did you become a knowledgeable citizen at six you found yourself watching a panel of experts debate the use of sources of Bob Woodward for his book "Fear," wearing Paul Manafort's camel-skin jacket.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"The part of the policy he's doing makes it the same as a reality show that comforts you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive chief Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's stage and storyline player.
You don't want to miss an episode or miss an episode.
When I saw Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was hiding while watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He was unable to free himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh who was prepared to face the Senate Justice Committee and then the Supreme Court according to its balance.
"I remember when we had all these crazy shows that day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was like a joke, but it turns out they were right."

A lot of money from the outside is flooding the most intense part-time election competition in the White House.
It is only natural that Pennsylvania 17 gained a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of the congressional district that supplied two firecrackers in the same chair struggle.
The recently redecorated District of Pittsburg, filed Conor Lamb from Rep, Democrats who won seats in other districts by special election last spring.
Lamb advances against another firecracker, Republic of Keith Rothfus, now representing the old district of Pennsylvania 12, which overlaps with the new district of Pennsylvania 17.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally sided with the Republicans.
The competition for the new Pennsylvania 17 district has resulted in a huge campaign fund between the financial sides of the great party, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCC) and National Republic Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in March's special election that was monitored publicly for the District Congress of 18 Pennsylvania.
That chair has been occupied by Republicans officials for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district with 20 points.
Politicians sent Democrats a little ahead of themselves.
The U.S. Contributed El Salvador for Supporting China, then Regressed
diplomats confirm that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, giving little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the head of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the department, presented in a statement earlier this month.
But punishments were only considered against El Salvador, who had received the help of about $140 million from America in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
Proposed punishments, which include trimming financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, will hurt the Central American state and increase unemployment rates and murder rates.
When internal meetings took place, North American and Central American officials put off high-level conferences that focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on the same meeting last year that was considered a step forward to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid - September, government officials asserted that they wanted the conference to continue, to effectively end the judgment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to give a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for mid October, as an import signal carried out by the government at the meeting, revealing diplomats.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any new reproof or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate displayed by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of the circumstances.
Their statements were strengthened by outside analysts close to the government and also spoke of these obscure circumstances.
Study Story
Another shocking story is Robert Mueller's special advisory report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is now a very important piece of evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller's report also discusses whether Trump's campaign is colluding with Russia in an attack on our elections.
When Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable for himself, just as he's preparing to leave again in front of the voters, and perhaps finally a jury of his partners.
That's why there's still so much to do, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's reign is inevitable - or its equality in Europe.
There are options that we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler, if the West had fought against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The beginning of history centered along such a deviance point, and an accelerated or postponed democracy march was inevitable.
Now Americans are facing some of these changing points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under a lot of pressure since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested that secretly record the president and argue that he wasn't worthy of the president.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times account isn't true.
"How do we respond if the F.B.I. investigation that Brett Kavanaugh just asked is incomplete or fair--or if he's brought up to the Supreme Court despite any strong accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we gonna give a half-time vote to Congress that's gonna hold Trump accountable?
If we fail that test, democracy will worsen for a long time.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once inhabited my embassy.
He survived, immigrated to America and, in the next 60 years, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a table that had a swastika on it.
By leaving that legacy to me, how do I lose hope about our future?"

Rangers 'Graham Dorrans were optimistic before the games faced Rapid Vienna.
Rangers entertaining Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with victory over Austria, following the good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will strengthen their position to escape the European G League Group.
The knee injury makes the midfielder Graham Dorrans unable to appear this first season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can harness the result as a stepping stone into greater despair.
"It's very good for us because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old player.
"In this match we're sure we can get something and go by bagging one point.
In the end, we may be able to do that but, we think, the balance might be a fair result.
In the first half, they may look better but in the second half, we get up and become a better team.
Stepping on Thursday, tonight becomes another great day of Europe.
We were hoping to bag three points even though it would be a tough game because they had good results in their last game, but, with the suporter support behind us, I'm sure we can keep going forward and get positive results.
Last year, we had a hard time, because of what happened to my injury and the change in the club itself, but right now there's really good hope in this club.
This squad is good and the kids are really enjoying it. It's good practice.

Although surveyers have a clear idea of how they want to be treated, there are just not many people who discuss it with their family members.
About half the people in the Nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their partners.
Only 10 percent of them said they were discussing this with their children.
"They want family members to provide care, but there's not a move to start the discussion," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
This is where it's time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: you won't be able to prepare your own family for treatment if you don't tell them what you want first.
Discuss it with your counselor and family, where and how you get treatment, for what you choose will mean vital to the cost.
Involve your financial advisers: Your advisors can certainly provide you with help in showing you how to pay those costs.
The budget you choose for long-term treatment includes traditional long-term insurance policy, hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or insures yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: face legal debates that block.
Show immediate power to your health care, that is, someone you trust to ensure your health care and guarantee that your wishes are carried out by professionals when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, a letter of authority in your financial matters should also be considered.
Someone trusted to take care of all the financial decisions you had to choose, other than to make sure your bills were paid in case you weren't able to.
Keep in mind every detail as small as possible: Try to imagine when your elderly parents are in an emergency health condition and are on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer any questions about medicine or allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to answer.

A man was shot by a wind rifle in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot with a gun in the wind on his way home from a night party.
The victims in their 40s were in Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots hit the chest, stomach, and hands.
The shooting was described by the officer at approximately 2:30 BST, and it was said to be "a random act."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
The injuries the victim suffered did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses were filed by the police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis hit Indonesia
Earthquakes and tsunamis hit the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, at least 384 lives were lost, officers were informed, and the number of casualties were expected to increase.
The disconnecting communication has made it difficult for officials who are channeling the trouble of getting information from Donggala County, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake that struck with 7.5 magnitude Richter.
In Palu, after the disaster, over 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of major facts regarding the city of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
The hammer was the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the narrow end of the bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 3,79,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
Donggala, in the meantime, is a region of over 300 miles (180 km) from the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
This district, which is an administrative area under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 souls in 2017.
The most reliable economy in the Southern Sulawesi province is to look for fish and grow crops, especially on the Donggala coast.
Nevertheless, the existence of nickel mining played an important role in this province, although most were centered in Morowali, across the coast of Sulawesi.
Note that in the last 100 years, Hammer and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis, based on data from Indonesian Disaster Repetition Agency.
In 1938 more than 200 people died in tsunamis and hundreds of homes in Donggala were destroyed.
In 1996, nine people died in tsunamis in West Donggala.
Seismically speaking, Indonesia is located on the Ring of Fire of the Pacific and therefore an earthquake will occur regularly.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunamis that have hit the last few years are as follows:
In 2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake, on the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered tsunamis in 14 countries, thus losing 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the victims were in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes had struck the west coast of Sumatra.
On the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: A 6.8 - magnitude earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia’s densest island, causing tsunamis on the south coast and causing nearly 700 people to die.
In 2009: There was a 7.6 - powerful earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
The death toll was over 1,100.
2010: One island on the islands laughed, after Sumatra, was also hit by a 7.5 - strong earthquake, triggering a 10 - meter - high tsunami that instantly devastated dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya County, Aceh, also suffered shallow earthquakes and devastating earthquakes, as well as the panic of people who were reminded of the destruction of deadly earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
Although this time there was no potential tsunami, more than 100 people died because of the collapse of buildings.
In 2018: Lombok, called tourist island, also experienced a massive earthquake that killed more than 500 people, where most of the island’s north side.
The quake devastated thousands of buildings and temporarily spread thousands of tourists.
The Crown Prince Sarah Palin Was Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's eldest son, former governor of Alaska and vice president candidate, has been arrested on the pretext of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence reports and resisting arrest attempts, as the Alaskan State Police releases on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, she stole a phone call from the woman.
Palin was handed over in the Mat-Su Pretrial Prison, with a fine of $500 without bail, as reported by KTUU.
As reported on the news network, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring himself "innocuous, sure as" when asked about his defense.
Palin faced three minor violations of Class A, which could put him in jail for a year and a fine of $250,000.
Besides, he's also charged with criminal B-grade charges, with one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
For Palin, criminal charges this is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her own mother, Sarah Palin, who called the police to file a report about the alleged attack.
Currently the case is filed with the Alaskan Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence crimes, and possession of firearms drunk, which were also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was convicted of veterans for linking her son’s violence to PTSD as a result of her duties during Iraq.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia was hit by a violent earthquake until at least 384 victims died.
A 7.5 - scale earthquake potentially triggered tsunamis destroyed thousands of homes.
Power grids and communication lines are down, and death rates are expected to continue to grow over the next few days.
It struck central Sulawesi, located in northeast Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show how powerful the moment of disaster is circulating through social media.
Hundreds of people were gathered to assemble a beach festival in Palu’s city at that time, when tsunamis broke up the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking rare death penalty for suspected terror attacks at NYC.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking death row for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack on New York City, where eight people have been killed -- the sentence is rare and hasn't been committed in a federal crime state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is suspected of conducting an attack by crashing a truck he hired from Home Depot to pedestrians and cyclists along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death sentence, prosecutors had to give evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of the victims and "intentionally" also caused serious body injuries, based on a statement of the will to render the death penalty, filed into the South District of New York.
Based on the court's documents, both charges are possible to be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury framed Saipov with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder in the wake of extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organized crime, as well as violent charges and motor vehicle destruction.
According to the prosecution, the attack required "substantial planning and early exposure," as a picture of Saipov's crimes carried out by "violence, cruelty, and savagery."
Expressed in the declaration of will, "Sayfullo Habulaviv Saipov has caused injury, danger, and loss of family and friends from Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendo, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims of the incident were Argentinean tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York filed a death sentence last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of the murder of two drug suppliers, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last death penalty was executed in the federal court of New York in 1953, passed on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted in a conspiracy of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, Uzbekistan’s origin, showed no remorse as the days and months passed after the attack.
When questioned by an investigator, he said that he felt good about what he was doing, arrested the police.
Saipov also revealed to the authorities that his attacks were inspired by a video of ISIS being watched from his phone, as was the charge.
He also requested that ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room, said the police.
He pleads not guilty of the 22 charges he's been charged with.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, declared "clearly disappointed" to the prosecution's decision.
"We think the decision to execute death rather than accept a life sentence without guarantee of release will only prolong the trauma of those involved in the incident," show Patton.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had begged the prosecutor not to sentence him to death.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit negotiations, says MP Tory
Nigel Farage calls for 'the movement of the people' today in protests at Tory's conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the heat of Eurosceptics - because one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested sharing in negotiations with the EU.
Supporters of the conservative group, Peter Bone, told road action in Birmingham that the British should be 'out' at this time if Farage were to serve as Secretary of Brexit.
Nevertheless, the challenges May faced in her divided reconciliation have been underlined by the Remain Tories supporters who joined in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to maintain his Chequers compromise plan to stay on course despite the Brexiteers' attacks, the Remainers and the European Union.
Allied countries stress that he will be pushed forward to reach a deal with Brussels, despite having a bad back reaction-- and forcing Eurosceptics and Labor to choose between its proposed package and 'damage'.
Bone told the mob Leaves Leave in Solihull that he wants to get rid of the Chequers.
His proposal, that Farage should appoint a colleague to be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If his handler was still him, we'd be out by now," he said.
Councilor Wellingborough throws an additional: "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
The revelation, as he pointed out his opposition to the European Union: "We do not fight the world war to be submissive.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.'
Bone dismisss the proposal that public opinion has potentially made a difference since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the minds of the British people have changed and wanted a fixed condition, it's absolutely not true."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also part of the mob action, presented to reporters: 'Just a little, I would like to say: "O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers is not popular in public, whereas Opposition won't vote for it, because it's not popular with our party and our activists who are seriously going down the street and getting us elected first.
Our request, get rid of Chequers and start listening to us.'
Through a message addressed to May, he added: "The Ministers keep their jobs when their promises are kept."
Farage says that politicians have to be promoted to feel the heat if they want to deny the referendum decision in 2016.
‘The most precious thing is the trust between us - the people - and our politics,’ he expressed.
'They tried to defy Brexit and here we are today, asserting to them that 'we will not escape you'.
He also added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are preparing to deny Brexit, also feel the heat.
'We are moving the legacy of the people of this country that will win us at Brexit and will never surrender until Britain is independent, self-governing, and proud.'
Meanwhile, the Remainers mob moves through Birmingham before the action in the center of town for two hours.
The line of activists appears to be waving the Tories Against Brexit banner after triggering the line this weekend.
Partners in the line of labor, Lord Adonis, mocked the Conservative Group on the security issue of their party application when the conference opened.
'It was these people who told us that they could master the IT system and all the technology for Canada, anything, for anti-scoring borders, in the boundless trade of Ireland,' it turned out.
‘ What a show of humor.
There's absolutely no good Brexit,' it turns out.
Warren's planning on taking some serious action in the presidential campaign.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she was going to hit the presidential candidacy after the election in November.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats declared their future at the town hall in western Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, who often denounced President Donald Trump, ran for reelection in November against the state's GOP representative, Geoff Diehl, vice president of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was marked as a rival of Trump by 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, which has been called the city hall format since Trump served.
A participant asked him a question, whether there was a plan to run for president.
Warren answered, "It's the perfect time for women to enter the Washington circle to restore our broken government, and that includes the time for women to sit on top."

The Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after his team admitted his victory over Sebastian Vettel · Global Voices
Everything became clear when Valtteri Bottas was in front of Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying session on Saturday that would bring the Mercedes team's command has a big role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton because he held his position at the first two and pulled Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to drive into the pit and allow Hamilton to move in through the density at the end of the crowd, something that should be very decisive.
Mercedes went into the pit one lap later and got out after Vettel, but Hamilton kept going after a couple of chases that showed that the Ferrari driver's aversion left a blank inside with the risk of surviving after the double movement to survive in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and was in the seventh position at the end of his first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race because he held off the turn of the tire to target a quick solution and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth place.
He finally got into the pit in the 44th lap but couldn't improve his pace in the eight laps left because Raikkonen finally took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man let me.
Tim has done a remarkable job of having one or two," Hamilton said.
That's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein on a rally on Saturday through his insistence, he didn't leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about sexual assault on future Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking on a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement delivered by Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, rather than comment on what was happening at the Senate showing people who were "bad and perverted and dishonest."
"Something can happen and beautiful is happening over the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil and perverted and dishonest," he said.
"When you saw the leak and the leak and then they said "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it.
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak it," he added, as senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and it had leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak didn't come from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't leak the story," Feinstein told the committee, delivered Hill.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as secret as he asked."
But the rejection seemed unapproved by the president, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you, that's a really bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continued his defense against the future Supreme Judge, who was accused of sexual abuse of three women, the president was impressed to assume Democrats were using accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over power in various ways.
You see crime,sumption, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk for power and surveillance," the Mediaite report on the president's speech.

Air Traffic Drivers Died to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers In Earthquake Survived
An air traffic guide in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after his death while making sure that the aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others have disappeared after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering tsunamis.
Strong aftershocks continue to shake the region and many are trapped in the ruins of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled for their safety, 21-year-old Anthonius the Great Gunawan refused to leave his post at a heavy - shaking guide tower at the Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He chose to survive to ensure the 6321 Batik Air Flight which at the time was on the runway, could safely take off.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he felt the tower was starting to collapse.
She died after him in the hospital.
A spokesperson for the Indonesian Flight Navigator’s Society, Yohannes Sirait, delivered its decision to save hundreds of lives, a report from the news of ABC Australia.
We provided a helicopter from behind the board in Borneo to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter made it to Hammer.
"We're all sorry to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned that deaths can reach thousands after the National Countermeasures of Disaster convey access to the city of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is difficult.
"Courages are believed to continue to increase because many bodies are still overwhelmed by ruins and many others are beyond reach," said spokesperson of the national body countermeasure disaster Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching six meters have made the Hammer melt which causes mass funerals on Sunday.

Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini delivered one missing person after the lagoon plane crash · Global Voices
The air airline operates a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia saying one person has disappeared, after it was previously delivered to 47 passengers and the crew have been successfully evacuated from sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini delivered at a release on Saturday afternoon, its party could not identify a male passenger.
The airline says its parties have been working with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The airline did not quickly respond to the request for more detail regarding the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crews, after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials say on Friday that seven people have been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were left at the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the complete sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. airlines and naval forces both claim that the plane landed in the lagoon around the runway.
Several eyewitnesses felt that the plane was over the runway.
American citizen Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's really something good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to navigate water as high as the waist through the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He told the flight attendants to panic and scream, and he suffered a little head injury.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen who worked close around the repaired pier also helped rescue using rubber boats to transport people ashore before the plane sank some 30 feet [30 m] deep (100 feet] in the water.
The data from the Flight Security Network indicates that 111 people have died in a PNG-rated airline crash over the last two decades but none of it involves Air Niugini.
Analysts reveal the timeline of the night women who were burned alive.
The detainee thing that happened on Saturday was reexamination of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a big line to the jury about how he used cell phone recordings to collect the various movements the defendant was doing in the 29th year of Quinton Tellis and his 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received the location data from several cell phones showing Tellis was at one location with Chambers the night of his death, rather than reverse the previous defendant's statement, rumored to be Clarion Ledger.
When the data revealed that the defendant's cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford attended the trial on Saturday and he testified that he wasn't in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when she told me that she was in the Sanford truck the night of the incident, Sanford said she was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistencies delivered by Tellis were his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the victim’s death.
Cell phone records indicate they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett mentioned that after Chambers' death, sometimes Tellis deleted messages, calls and contact information Chambers from his phone.
"He erased the victim from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge claims he hopes the trial will lead to the jury after that day.

Another black guy?!
Nanny NY demands a partner for assaulting after releasing a "racalyst" message.
A New York nanny demands that one mate have attacked the discriminatory after receiving an indirect message from a mother who complained and declared that she was "another black person."
The couple refused to consider them racists, and considered them more like "experimental."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her anxiety when she realized that the new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"THE OTHER BLACKS" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, the Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, claiming that they had issued a nanny, who was an African-American mixed citizen, for having done a bad job and he was expecting the Filipinos, based on the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice demands that the couple compensate for the dismissal, and asks for compensation about $350 a day for a period of six months, in exchange for the caregiver's work that he first had to do, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that," he said to the Post on Sunday, then added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple against claims that claim they're racists, claiming that Maurice's fired workers are a reasonable thing to do, they're afraid they can't believe it after mentioning it,
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists, but Joel Plasco's husband said to the Post.
"But will you let your children be treated by someone whom you have wronged, even though it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As wrapped in "experience," said Plasco his wife had only two months of birthing her baby and was in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone in that condition?
That's not a good thing to do," an investment banker added.
By the time legal cases were still in play, public courts had quickly identified the couple in social media, blaming them for their attitudes and logic.
The publisher Paddington was worried that the reader wouldn't be in touch with the talking bear, the new newspaper revealed.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born not far after her book was accepted, was explained in a letter: "It's hard to just talk without knowing the position she experienced, read it first before it was published.
It's funny how we know about Paddington's great success."
Says his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through the writing of a boy's book with a bear, who was very optimistic about his work that had been turned down, he added a 60th anniversary of the publication of the book that he felt was sweet after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, who he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father quite proud of the end of his success.
"He's a pretty quiet guy, and he's not an arrogant guy," she said.
"But since Paddington means so much to him, it's like you have a child who has achieved something: you're proud of them even though not all your efforts.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave Paddington credit for himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her over the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter was immediately taken to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, but the doctors failed to rescue her.
"Nad made the call calmly to convey it so badly that he was most likely not to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die within the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors have given to keep his heart beating slowly and slowly away from his system.
He's been dead for quite some time and everything feels deadly.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't moan, or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold it all back."
At last Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, is now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarding a plane along with other passengers - unaware of what she's been through.
"No one knows about it," he said.
"My head bows down and my tears keep dripping all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on that flight I felt a deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I know how much she loves him."
The grieving women posted cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones trying to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be reached for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel as I do every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that his smile brightens the mood."
But, he quit his job before he died, just like he "was in a very dark place."
In 2014, brother Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I keep worrying that there will be an ongoing effect."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there you can go and talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't sit there and shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who was friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed there was a change in his behavior.
He's at his lowest point at Christmas-- when the kids open their presents he doesn't look them in the eye or anything."
He said his death was a major trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "It's a pitfall in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future was in uncertainty when the FBI started its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking--a limited time investigation, limited its scope--we might be able to bring in a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he fears the "destroyed" committee in the middle of a council verdict.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans want the FBI to investigate?
Their resistance is all because of time.
Legislative elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th - if, as expected, Republicans do it badly, they will become very weak in their opportunity to get the person they want to be elected in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House for Mr. Bush and passed by meeting his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI filed the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It's still unclear that Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors under Kim
The number of people who turned their backs from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un ruled seven years ago, says a Korean parliamentary ban.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted data from the Southern Ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park says the border control between North Korea and China and the higher rates collected by smugglers is the key factor.
Pyongyang doesn't make public comments.
Most defectors from the North were eventually offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which had the longest border with North Korea and was easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone in between Korea.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return home.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is technically still in the war - has greatly increased in the last few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for a conversation centered on the negotiations of pending denuclearization.
This happened after a historic June meeting between U.S. president Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to cooperate about the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blames U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, there is no way we're going to drop our weapons on one side," Mr. Ri said in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh "hisitical," said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Party Leader Nancy Pelossi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hissterical" and said he wasn't fit in with a temper to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made that comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman performs like that, they'll say "histerical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusation that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost screaming and having trouble talking when discussing his family and his years during high school.
He also specifically condemned Democrats on the committee, saying the charge against him was "unreasonable and coordinated character murder" organized by liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi says he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't serve in the Supreme Court because he's biased towards Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude toward Clinton and Democrat," he said.
Pelosi protested that he would try to prosecute if he was approved, and if Democrats earned more votes at the People's House of Representatives.
"I would say like this -- if he didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he wasn't fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he was right now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he was a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decision on the Health Services Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was viewed as a conservative judge of justice.
In the promotion hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time for someone hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, 'isn't that great,' said Pelosi.
And women need to deal with it.
It was an ethical abuse, months of anger and years of anger, and he couldn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry, Miss Steinem says to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, what do you think?"
He continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique which meant that she was angry and started crying, she would say to someone who was talking to her, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he goes on.
And I think it's brilliant."
Tears were drawn out as a partial solution to anger because he was fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of early work, in a man-dominated office, one time I cried with inexpressible anger, was my neck gripped by an older woman--a cold manager I was always the least afraid of-- who dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they think they made it.
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair outside the wedding on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Miss Schroeder, was frustrated, understanding that there was no reason for herself not to run for president.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was too late for the campaign, he was left behind at the fundraiser, and so he swore he wouldn't vote unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a battle that led to defeat.
He found out that some of his supporters gave $1,000 to a guy just gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
When he gave a speech announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was too overwhelmed by emotion - gratitude to those who supported him, frustration with the system that made the fundraiser so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and the anger of sexism - making him difficult to talk.
"You'll probably think that I'm too nervous," recalls Miss Schroeder about how the press reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsorship company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my headstone?
"She cries?"
How the U.S.-Tongkok trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening shots of trading competition between the U.S. and China were so severe, and when the fight was still far from over, the struggle between the two countries could have been profitable for Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first anniversary of this year by applying taxes to Chinese key exports including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
A significant increase was imposed from this week on a new rate that affected $200 billion ($250 billion), effectively enforcing taxes half of all goods that entered the U.S. through China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, recently imposed a fifth to ten percent rate on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has begged to match the U.S. one-on-one, and the second largest economy in the world will not change anytime soon.
To tell Washington to back off means to follow the will, but publicly yielding to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, president of China.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play the cards correctly, the pressure of US trading competition can be positive for China in the long run by reducing the dependence on both economics.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can create a condition that triggers economic movements in both countries is actually more dangerous than any observer has ever known," says Abigail Grace, a fellow researcher who focuses on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert institution.
Syria is prepared for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says that they are ready for the return of voluntary refugees and offer help to rebuild countries destroyed by over seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country improved.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and safe thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that terrorists destroyed to restore it to its original state.
All present conditions are due to the voluntary return of refugees to countries that they have to leave behind because of widespread terrorism and economic decisions that make their daily lives and livelihood a target.
The UN estimates more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive assistance to rebuild a ruined country.
But he stressed that they would not accept aid or conditional aid from countries that support rebellion.
