A rapidly rising cumulative incident of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European/Forest Economy of Europe and Great Britain, January 1, to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incident in the case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/U.S. Economy that confirms that, despite its different stages depending on the state, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in all countries.
According to Italian experience, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their readiness for a spike in COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the pneumonia cluster with unknown etyology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent of this disease was a new coronavirus called acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of the people with COVID-19 suffer from mild disease, which is a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with most of the sufferer cured.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease and requires hospital care, while 6% of other cases suffer from critical diseases that require intensive care.
A patient who was hospitalized with COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we studied the trend of cumulative incidents COVID-19 countries of the European Union/EEA (EU) and Britain (UK) and then compared them to the incident in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared today's cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK with the number of cases in Italy during January 31st,–15 March 2020.
The case of COVID-19 in the country of EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 experienced further geographical spread and COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in other parts of the world today follow the China pandemic dynamics.
On March 11, 2020, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 Eurosurveillance, Spiter et al reports the first Europeans with the COVID-19 case confirmed by the WHO case definition.
At EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 on those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On March 15, 2020, the case of COVID-19 was detected throughout 30 EU/EA countries and the UK, between December 31 and March 15, 2020 and that date included 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17.750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents of the COVID-19 case
In the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Prevention (ECDC), the number of cases COVID-19 that every country around the world is told is being updated every day at 8: 00 p.m., this number is obtained only from such official sources as the State Health Ministry, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK, and compare them to trends in Italy.
As a prevalence proxy of the case COVID-19 is active, we count cumulative incidents beheaded 14 days, so calculate the natural journey of COVID-19, in each country of EU/EEA and UK, within the period of January 1,–15 March 2020.
We also present cumulative numbers of cases that each country has been informed about until March 15, 2020 at 8: 00 p.m. compared with the case of Italy during the January 31st,–15 maret 2020.
CoVID-19 trend in EU/EEA and UK countries
The cumulative trend was cut off 14 days of COVID-19 in the country of EU/EEA and UK generally following trends in Hubei Province (Tungkok) (Image 1).
For EU/EEA and UK as a whole, the cumulative incident of COVID-19 began to rise about February 21, and then increased sharply around February 28, 2020.
This trend is primarily moved by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EA countries and UK show a trend in increasing cumulative COVID-19 incidents similar (Auxiliary cases).
Image 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA state and UK compared with the cumulative numbers in Italy during the January 31st,–15 March 2020.
The data points to that, up to 15 March at 8: 00 a.m., 15 other EUA and UK countries have reported a total number of cases equivalent to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of cases of COVID-19 that were told increased rapidly in EU/EEA and UK.
The trends observed in the Cumulative incident of COVID-19 suggest that pandemics are increasing at a comparable rate in all countries.
It's despite the difference in the stages that countries experience, the variations in public health responses, and the possible differences in case definitions between the state and the protocol difference in selecting patients who have to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which include follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the Italian region who were exposed explained the situation by about 10% of patients in COVID-19 needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, CAVID-19 admissions data at the hospital and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA levels are only available to each 6% and 1% cases (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and death rates.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed great variations in the availability of European intensive care beds and treatments, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and madya care per 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
Modeling scenarios related to the saturation of health care capacity, with COVID-19 prevalency estimates are treated for each country's EU/EEA and UK related to the risk >90% beyond the capacity of intensive bed care, provided at the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Because so far the hottest cases in certain areas of the EU and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a population of regional services coverage, information about cases and beds of intensive care should be provided at the naming level of Regional Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing very rapidly in EU/EA and UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenarios and increase the number of patients in COVID-19 in need of health care, especially intensive care, as is happening in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the recent rapid risk assessment of ECDC, a quick, proactive approach, and comprehensively necessary to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a transition from containment approach to the mitigation approach, because the rapid increase in the number of cases, as anticipated, may not give the decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept, and adapt the proper response if they were not applied earlier.
Such a quick risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of pandemics.
There is a short window of opportunity when the country has a greater chance of improving its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EUA state health care system will likely encounter a spike in patients who require intensive care within the next few days or weeks.
Coronavirus outbreak 2019 (COVID-19), caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and other places in the world, causing disaster for humans.
Similar to the homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in the thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and causing similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Even so, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortity than SARS, but it is more contagious and more about aging than young people, and more in men than in women.
In response to the fast - growing number of publications about this newly developed disease, this article tried to give a timely and comprehensive review of the subject of rapid development.
We'll discuss the basics of epidemiology, etyology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this review will help us to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were ordered to stay home during the holidays and a few weeks later because of the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus was highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) which caused the outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the disease caused by which it was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemics began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and into nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Up to March 2, 2020, this virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being sent home and 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "enemy public number 1" and potentially destructive more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7th 2020 that established the sequence of viruses isolated from some patients, more than 200 papers were published about COVID-19, which included virology, epidemiology, etyology, diagnosis, and treatment.
This review is trying to summarize the progress of research in the field of this fast - growing new subject.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV diseases, which are called Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreaks in 2012).
We will also discuss matters that have been learned so far regarding prevention and prognosis of disease as well as some other unanswered questions but urgent.
According to tradition, CoV is considered a nonletal pathogen to humans, especially causing about 15% of the cold 4.
Nevertheless, in this century, we've found CoVs that were highly pathogenic for humans twice, which is SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortity.
Because of that, COVID-19 is currently the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the pneumonia cluster with its first unknown origin was reported from Wuhan on December 31st, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence launched.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, epidemics spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, a health - care infection was reported, which suggests that human-to-human transmissions might occur.
On January 23, the quarantine area was imposed in the city of Wuhan and the entire public transport was halted.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with a confirmed case, only 21 patients directly associated with the Wuhan marine food market are considered to be the site of an early infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30th, WHO declared this epidemic a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Gbr.2).2).
Because the situation develops very quickly, the final coverage and severity of the plague must still be set.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study of 8,866 patients, which included 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented an image of the following more updated epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at the age of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected people are over 50 years old, few are under 20 years of age, and only 14 are infected under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects men more than women (0,31/100.000).
The COVID-19 extends in clusters, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from awitan to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3,0-7,2) days.
The average time from awitan to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive numbers (R0) are 3,77 (95% CI: 3,51-4,05) and R0 are adjusted to 2,23-4,82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before Jan 23, 2020, according to the time of massive transport before the Spring Festival in China.
Patient morality with a confirmed case of 1.44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%) and a customized mortity for all patients at 3.06% (95% CI: 2,02-4,59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 are gender, age (160), and pneumonia are heavy.
CoV is a large knotted subfamily virus containing a single strand of echo sense.
CoV can be divided into four genus, which is alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein bumps or spikes (S) cover bonds with their cell receptors, angiotension 2 enzymes (ACE 2) and speptyl peptide 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The genem RNA virus is released into cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA is accompanied by glycoprotein covers and nucleokapsid proteins form vesicles containing virion, which then develops fusion with plasma membranes to release the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences first reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coV with more than 99.98% of the 10 sequenced samples; the sample was taken from the site of the outbreak, the Huanan Sea Food Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more like SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the microscope of the transmission electrons, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the very thin epitelium of the human airway.
ACE2 humans were found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
Even so, S SARS-CoV-2 proteins bond with ACE2 humans are weaker than their S SARS-CoV proteins, which are consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes non-serious infections to SARS-CoV patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded with orf3b and proteins secreted in code orf8.
Proteins orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of the expression IFN; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure at a 2.9 Å resolution in a complex with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that complexes, which have open and closed conformations, are arranged to form a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which are evidence of CoV identification and infection.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in drug filtering to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and intermediary
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and each one is transmitted to humans through weasels and camels.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with another CoV, bats are considered the original hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediary host who helped the virus cross species barriers to infect humans is still unknown, and the transmission route must still be explained.
Ji, et al. proposes a snake carrying a virus from a bat to a human that involves homologous recombination in S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, propose that the mills, long - eaten mammals of ants often used in traditional Chinese medicines, potentially as brokers SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology on CoV found in the mills and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the differences spread throughout the genome are still a big difference; therefore, the results that are conclusive as concrete evidence are not yet obtained (Gbr. 3).
SARS-CoV-2's physicalochemical properties are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20 °C and humidity 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant containing chlorenetic acid, chloroform, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexin, effectively disabling the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other CoV studies before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Generally speaking, after invasion of the host, the virus is identified by the built-in immune system through pattern recognition receptors (NLR), which include C-type select-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RR).
Through different paths, viruses induce expressions of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell capitalization, and interferon type I (IFN) that limit the spread of viruses and accelerate antigen virus phagocytes by macrophag.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune response.
Shortly thereafter, adaptive immune responses joined the battle against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
The helper T cells produce the proinflamatory cytokines to help protect the cell.
Even so, CoV can inhibit T cells by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral Immunities, which include complements, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in fighting viral infections.
For example, the antibody isolated from the cured patients neutralizes MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune systems react to large amounts of local free radicals, which can cause severe lung and other organs damage, and, in the worst case scenarios, compound organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, marked by awitan cluster, are more about aging with authoritative diseases and pregnant women.
Generally, people exposed to large amounts of viruses or whose immune functions were compromised have higher chance of infections than anyone else.
The estimated average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases indicates that the average incubation period is 3 days and ranges from 0 to 24 days.
A newer study, as explained above, indicates that the 4.8 incubation period (3,0-7,2) is based on demographic 8,866 cases.
It is vital that health authorities adjust quarantine times effectively based on the most accurate incubation period that prevents infected people, but without symptoms, transmit viruses to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to viruses or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period extend to 24 days?
Fever is often a symptom of major and early COVID-19, with or without symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, bubble, headache, throat pain, rinore, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients suffer from disspinea and/or hypochemia one week after the awitan disease.
In severe cases, the growth of the patient’s illness is rapidly becoming acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without lung imaging disorders, must be filtered against the virus for early diagnosis.
The demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that a percentage of symptoms of 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dissinea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients need ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, which are studies on family clusters and clusters caused by transmissions from asimtomatics.
Compared to that, demographic studies in 2012 indicate that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptom.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than the patients of COVID-19 and are consistent with MERS' higherletality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%) are also observed on MERS patients.
SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), disspinea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and throat pain (13-25%) are shown as major symptoms and ventilation support are needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
Up to 14th February, COVID-19 mortity was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, SARS’s mortity in November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, mortity is 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
The previous study reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a 95% trust interval of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV is only between 2 and 4.
The comparison SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortity, and R0 are given on Table 1.
The numbers show that SARS-CoV-2 has higher spread capabilities than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as lethal as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV pandemic and SARS-CoV.
Awitan plaster is often found in a family or from a group or a vehicle like a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other impacted areas or in contact with an infected person or a patient in the last two weeks before awitan.
However, it is reported that people can carry a virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients released from the hospital can carry a virus again, causing caution to increase quarantine time.
In the initial stage, patients have a normal or reduced white blood cell count (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia by counting white blood cells < 4×109/L, which involves counting lymphocytes < 1×109/L, and increasing levels of aminotransferase and viremia are found at 1.099 COVID-19 patients.
The liver and muscle enzyme levels and the mioglobins increase in the blood of a number of patients, as well as the C-reactive protein and blood deposit rate increase in most patients.
In heavy cases, D-dimer levels rise, which is the product of the fibrinal decomposing in the blood, and the lymphocyte count drops progressively.
The abnormality of the thorax photo was found in the large form of the patient COVID-19 and marked with a cloudy cloudy shadow ifteral or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute breathing syndrome.
When ARDS occurs, inflammation of irresponsibility, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis exacerbates gas exchange disorders.
Pneumocyte dysfunction type I and type II lower the surfinity rate and increase the surface pressure so that lower the lung capacity to expand and increase the risk of lung collapsed.
Hence, the worst findings on thorax photos are often parallel to the worst of diseases.
On February 18, 2020, COVID-19's first pathological analysis showed pneumocyte disasure, hyalin membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocytes, as well as multiple synsite cells in the patient's lungs, according to the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to SARS pathological analysis of patients and MERS.
Detect the RNA SARS-CoV-2 through the reaction of the polymerase chain of retractors (RT-PCR) used as the main criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because of the false negative level, which could speed up the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depended on the RT-PC) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred in the SARS diagnosis.
Hence, a combination of the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiologic findings is essential and a need to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group described the use protocol of CRISPR-based SHERLOCK engineering to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects the fragment of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA at 20 × 10-18 moles/L to 200 × 10-18 moles/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without requiring elaborate instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly increase sensitivity and ease if verified in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors primarily offer support care to patients in COVID-19, while trying various therapies that have been used or proposed previously for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).2).
It includes current therapy and potential therapy with antivirus drugs, immunity, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional Chinese drugs, and psychological support.
Even plasma from cured patients is proposed for use in therapy.
The pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 especially attacked the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 in lower levels, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Hence, respiratory support is vital for reducing symptoms and saving lives, which includes general oxygen therapy, high - flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be supported by oxygenation of an extractorporeum membrane (ECMO), a life - threatening cardiopulmonary shortcut technique used for heart failure or breathing treatment.
In addition, the security of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of vital organs is also vital to SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in a citation of SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine is a form of systemic inflammatory response marked by release of a series of cytokines, including TNF., IL-1. IL-2, IL-6, IFN fucking IFN.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals that lead to ARDS and compound organ failure.
Immunosuption is vital in the handling of cytokines, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocirizub, an anti-IL6 monoclonal anti-IL6 antibodies, have been used to deal with the cytokines.
Another immune control for the cytokin storm includes the modulation of immune responses directed by T cells; the blocking of the IFN-ServAuthDir, the IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibisi; the blantenomab; the suppressing signals cytokin 4; and the HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunes, are widely used in SARS care to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids on high doses are useless for severe lung injuries to patients SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, steroids can have severe side effects, especially osteonekrosis, which greatly influence prognosis.
However, brief corticosteroids are given to low doses until are being encouraged to be given with caution to critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed yet.
Intravene, however, an analog of nucleotide, was found to be effective in an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antivirus developed by Gilead, originally for disease treatment caused by Ebola and Marlburg.
Later, the remdesivir also showed inhibisy to other single - strand RNA viruses, which include MERS and SARS.
According to this, Gilead provides China with a series of experiments on SARS-CoV-2 infected people, and the results are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-ا, lopinavir/rritonavir, and Rimbvirin have been recommended as a potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side reactions can occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/rrionavir.
These interactions with other medications that patients use must be carefully monitored.
Plasma from cured patients and antibody manufacturing.
There is a long history of patient blood collections that have been cured of infectious diseases to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
Granted, cured patients often have relatively high antibody levels in their blood.
Antibodies are immunelobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocyte B to fight off pathogens and other foreign objects, identify unique molecules in pathogens, and neutralize them instantly.
According to this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and are injected with 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, along with a decrease inflammatory and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
But verification and clarification need to be done to apply that method to large - scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some of the flaws associated with plasma must be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate immune responses in excess and cause cytokin release syndrome, which is potentially life threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low and plasma is required in large quantities to treat critically ill patients.
The development and production of specific antibodies is fast enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic code that involves effective antibodies or perform effective antibody filtering to proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect is largely dependent on the combination of components in the formula, and the formula is different depending on the diagnosis of disease based on TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because they are difficult to extract or verify the component or its optimal combination.
Currently, due to effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 does not exist yet, TCM has become one of the major alternative therapies for patients with mild symptoms to moderate or for people recovering from severe illness.
For example, Shu Fu Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The highest level of recovery in COVID-19 patient therapy is observed in some Chinese provinces that use TCM at 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei province, which uses TCM only at about 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other effects, such as the number and severity of the patient, must be included in evaluation.
On February 18th, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends published a study that compared Western drug therapy only with the combined therapy of WM and TCM.
They found that the time needed for body temperature recovery, loss of symptoms, and intake was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
The more impressive thing is, the symptoms hunting rate (light to weight) is much lower for WM+TCM groups than it is for WM groups (7.4% over 46.2%) and mortity is lower in WM+TCM groups than it is with WM groups (8.8% over 39%).
Even so, TCM’s efficiency and security are still waiting for a better controlled trial on a larger scale and at more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the work mechanism and clarify effective components in TCM therapy or combinations, if possible.
Most of the patients suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are very frightened of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Further, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough and side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental distress.
In the initial phase of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor fluctuations, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even the switchidity was once reported.
Tracking the records of contact and quarantine is mandatory, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Hence, mental health care must be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected people, and those in contact with them, as well as the common people in need.
Psychological support must include the formation of multidiscipline mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, and plan therapy and use of professional devices and electronic applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccine is essential for breaking the transmission chain of animal and human reservoirs infected with vulnerable host and often complementing antivirus therapy in controlling the epidemic caused by viral outbreaks.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines, which are long-term and effective in creating neutral antibodies and/or immunes that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, a live-weak vaccine has been evaluated on experimental animals.
Nevertheless, the efiction in vivo of this vaccine in the elderly and its model of catal challenges and its protection of zoonotic viral infections must still be determined before clinical studies begin.
This is probably because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, the sporadic and cluster cases of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas because zoonotic sources continue in the endemic areas.
The vaccine strategy has been developed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that is safe and effective for non-immunsive people is a very urgent and important task of controlling an ongoing epidemic.
However, this difficulty is not easy to solve because it's a long time to develop vaccines and dynamic CoV variations.
As a new disease, COVID-19 was just beginning to show his full clinical journey to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can progress without sequela.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also linked to high morbidity and mortity in patients with heavy cases.
Hence, the formation of a prognosis model of disease is essential for health care to give priority to its services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can affect or be associated with the prognosis of the patient COVID-19 (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 especially occurs at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over 50 in studies containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have a corroboration of authorship and complications and significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (median age 66 over 51), which signals age as a prognostic factor for the final outcome of patient COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0,31/100000 compared to 0.27/100000), as described above.
Commorbidity and complications: Patient COVID-19 in need of intensive care has a more likely acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events also provide a major reason for the death of SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to have also been linked to colangiosite with ACE2-positive, which can result in liver dysfunction in patients COVID-19.
It is important to note that the underlying age and disease are highly correlated and can influence one another.
abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein levels in the blood reflect inflammatory severity or tissue injury and are proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between CRP levels and severity as well as COVID-19 prognosis has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartat aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), and kreat kinase (CK) can also help predict final results.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: photo toraks and developments of temporal clinical symptoms must be considered along with other things to predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As explained above, steroids are largely immune to the use of support therapy for infection diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high - dose corticosteroids are widely used in SARS patients, many survivors of this disease end up suffering from osteonecrrhosis with life - sustaining disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, when necessary, steroids must be used in low doses and a short period of time in patients COVID-19.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer tremendous stress because they have to undergo long - term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long - term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemiological image than SARS.
In addition to replicating in lower respiratory tracts, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in upper respiratory channels and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, in the early phase or incubation period, infected patients can produce large amounts of viruses during daily activity, which poses great difficulty in controlling epidemics.
However, SARS-CoV transmissions are believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most of them do not occur in the initial phase.
The COVID-19 outbreak is thus much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, great efforts are being made in China, which includes quarantine of the Wuhan region and surrounding cities and sustainable quarantine of most of the population in the hope of intercepting SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although this act is very damaging to the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients is dropping, indicating an epidemic delay.
The most optimistic estimation states the outbreak will end in March and the descent phase lasts for 3-4 months.
Some other experts, though, are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. confirmed that COVID-19, which seems to be far more contagious than SARS, would not have ended in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. created a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and claimed that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in mid-cons and the patient's throat that had healed and returned from the hospital two weeks earlier. This indicates that a reident virus could be a recurring episode, similar to influenza.
Even so, promising signs are happening in China, based on the decline in the number of new cases, which suggests that today's strategy might work.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause a million cases with half as well as death.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease can finally be controlled.
It may also be, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is weakened by its ability to infect and eventually disappear or become a virus that is not too pathogenic to align with humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Gbr.5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through cough or sneeze, and may also be through direct contact with the substance contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the fesses, thus exposing the possibility of a new transmission, which is a feses-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may have been caused by a narcissic infection, which includes 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions must be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even people who happen to be in contact with infected patients or people.
The first defense line that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (the 1860s serial number) helping control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks keep potentially infected people’s spit from getting caught in the air or sticking to the surface of the material, where the spit can be passed on to others.
However, only an N95 mask (the 1860s serial number) can protect against the virion inhalation of a size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virion can completely penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, both measuring about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, health care providers who directly communicate with patients should wear N95 instead of surgical masks.
Besides masks, health care providers must wear appropriate isolation robes to reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect someone through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through eye inflammation.
Therefore, health care providers must also wear an invisibility shield or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in the affected or potentially impacted areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay home for self - quarantine, and avoid contact with potential infected people.
Three feet is believed to be a good distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have been a great warning for China that had strong memories of SARS outbreak in 2003.
Nevertheless, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control calmed the population by saying that this new virus has low - spread properties and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and the prevention and containment of this disease is not a problem.
This message calms the fears of society, especially when the entire country is preparing for the Spring Festival, so that critical time has passed to suppress the still small-scale disease in Wuhan.
Chinese disease - control agencies should learn from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because each word is observed by the population and can change its attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from the clinic than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorities; (3) more restricting the potential of epidemics in the early stages, and not trying to calm the public; and (4) more often emit target practice and effective to increase public awareness of disease epidemics and test and increase community response systems periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to spread in late December 2019.
In less than two months, plagues had spread throughout China and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of writing this review.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and COVID-19 and SARS symptoms are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has the same effect as the SARS outbreak repeating itself.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are vital to stem the epidemic and deal with patients.
COVID-19 is more about older than young people and more about men than women, and death rates are higher in age than young people do.
SARS morality is higher than COVID-19 morality (10,91% than 1.44%).
Patient COVID-19 transmits the virus even when they're without symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they're seriously ill.
This explains some of the reasons SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Asai RNA routine to check SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results to several COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can have more positive results on viral examination.
This discovery greatly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
With the progress of COVID-19 research so quickly, some important problems still have to be solved, which is:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there is a 96% genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two Samos-like bats, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal is an intermediary species to transmit the virus from its host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers number 1 and 2, we can't cut off transmissions effectively and the outbreak can spread back at any moment.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical analytics suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is bonding with ACE2, how exactly does a virus get into the air duct cells and cause further pathological changes?
Is this virus linked to the cell that expresses ACE2 in other organs?
Without obvious answers to these questions, we cannot reach fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long is this epidemic going to take?
How does the virus develop genetically during human transmissions?
Is this pandemic going to be a worldwide pandemic, end up like SARS, or repeat itself periodically like the flu?
The answers to the above and many other statements are vital, but they may take time to find them.
Nevertheless, at any cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
The origin of the zoonotic virus corona human
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven co-evolutionous corona viruses (CoV) and their host, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoV) were known to cause mild diseases, such as colds.
The epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome reverses the situation and reveals how much HCoV infection can be destructive and life threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China by the end of 2019 has made the CoV a relight and surprise us with a high transmission, but with a lower pathogenicity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infections are zoonosis, therefore, the original understanding of HCoV zoonotics will benefit us.
Most HCoVs come from bats on these animals, viruses are not pathogenic.
Some HCoV middleman host has also been identified.
The identification of an animal host has immediate implications for human disease prevention.
The CoV-inang interaction investigation in animals can also provide an important insight into CoV pathogenics in humans.
In this review, we present a general picture of today's knowledge of seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their inventions as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmissions.
The important thing is, we're comparing and contrasting the HCoV from the evolutionary point of view and recombination of the genome.
The epidemic of CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, successful host transition requirements and the implications of viral evolution in the severity of disease are also highlighted.
Corona (CoV) virus comes from the Coronaviridae family, consisting of a group of veiled RNA viruses, positive senses, and single strands.
This virus has the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobasas between RNA viruses called "CoV", because its morphology is similar to the crown under the electron microscope.
According to its structure, the CoV has an unenhanced genome that has similar settings.
About two thirds of the genomes are two large open-read structures that overlap each other. They are transulated into polyproteins replicas of pp1a and ppp1ab.
Polyproteins have further processing to form 16 nonstructureal proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of open - read skeletons (ORF) for structural proteins, which include bulges or spikes (S), veils or envelopes (E), membranes (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
A number of specific complementary proteins for certain bloodlines are also encoded by various CoV bloodlines.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genus (alpha-CoVs, beta-CoVs, gamma-CoVs, and delta-CoVs); among the four genus beta-CoVs have the most number of HCOVs and are divided into four bloodlines (A, B, C, and D).
Phlogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are a source of genes mostly alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there have been seven known covs.
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-coVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, corona virus, acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), corona virus, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing an infection of low-heavy breathing at relatively more patients and has a higher chance of developing into acute pest syndrome and manifestations outside the pulmonary organs.
The first Strain HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the patient's snot that was common in the mid 1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been collected through deep study of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both causing symptoms that heal themselves.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infections are generally harmless, until SARS outbreaks occur.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 was one of the most destructive outbreaks in current history, which infects more than 8,000 people with a rough death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, outbreaks of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with spores spreading across the world.
New HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), next called SARS-CoV-2, is a causative agent of the disease epidemic of Korona 2019 (COVID-19), who has claimed the lives of more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounded and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins from bats, rats, or pets.
Many evidence supports the origin of evolution of all HCoVs of bats.
The COVID-19 epidemic has raised tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
The original track of the zoonotic HCoV gives the framework to understand natural history, driving power, and limiting factors between species.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir animals, brokers, and applicant SARS-CoV-2, which has important implications for future prevention of dispersion.
In this review, we give a general picture of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmissions, and HCoV pathogenics.
We specifically highlight and discuss the general topic that HCoV's mother virus is usually nonpatogenic in its natural reservoir, but it becomes pathogenic after transmission of interspecies to the host.
We also consider HCoV's evolutionary trend that increased transmission capabilities are often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The final outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of HCoV-229E the first strain of the snot of patients exposed to colds, various CoVs had been isolated from various infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative clue.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the patient’s airways that contracted an upper airway infection in 1966, which was further adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E show symptoms of common colds, which include headaches, sneezing, fatigue, and sore throats, along with fever and cough seen at 10~20% of the cases.
Next in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and seriesal lanes in the breast-feeding sinew brain.
Clinical images of HCoV-OC43 infection seem similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symtomaticly indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and rhinovirus viruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are scattered around the world and tend to be most transmitted during the winter in temperate climate.
Normally, these two viruses have less than a week and are followed by a period of pain for about two weeks.
Based on a human volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E have mild colds.
Few patients with weakened immune systems show an infection in lower breathing tracts.
SARS, also known as "pneumonia athilis", was the first pandemic that was well documented in human history and its etyological agent was SARS-CoV, the third HCOV that was discovered.
SARS ’ first case can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, scattered throughout many countries and continents.
Regardless of the super-smooth, each case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the peak load of the virus is seen on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced mialgia, headaches, fevers, languids, and shivers, followed by dissepnea, coughs, and respiratory disorders as advanced symptoms.
Limfopenia, an abnormal liver function test, and the increase in kreatin kinase is a common laboratory abnormality in SARS.
The damage to alveolars, epitel cell proliferation, and macrophag increases are also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tracts, some organs that include gastrointestinal tracts, livers, and kidneys can also be infected in cases of weight, usually accompanied by cytokines, which can be deadly, especially in patients with weak immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy relative of a zero patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old boy from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially very common in children, elderly, and immune patients who suffer from respiratory disease.
Coriza’s image, conjugative, fever, and bronchiolitism are commonly found in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation of an eight-month-old male specimen who suffers from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually spreading around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of general respiratory diseases and peak events occurred early in the summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with an inhibitive laryngitis, which is also called crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was treated for pneumonia and bronchiolits in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolits, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma exasperation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
The four HCoV communities have fully adapted to human beings and are generally less likely to mutate into highly pathogenic diseases.
Generally, when it comes to the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself within humans, it also decreases the virulence and pathogenicity of HCoV.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old patient's lungs who had acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed lab cases are from the Middle East, occasional secondary imports to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to the clinical manifestation of SARS, characterized by progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also suffered acute kidney failure, which so far has only occurred to MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients show symptoms of gastrointestinals, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Until February 14, 2020, over 2500 lab cases were reported with the death of a high case of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most terrifying viruses known to man.
In mid to late December 2019, the pneumonia cluster is retrospectively linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the outbreak of an ongoing lower respiratory infection and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as Global Health Emergency and named the disease COVID-19.
Until March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a violent death rate of 3.4%.
For the record, the death of a case in Hubei, China, was 4.2%, while the death of a case outside Hubei at 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with a picture of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the toughest symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of the high homology of nucleotide sequences, by 82%, they are grouped into different filogenetic branches.
SARS-CoV-2 Patogonyisticity is definitely lower, but it's more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The subject infected SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms has been reported and may play a role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the world.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 to six other HCoVs shows very interesting equations and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of the HCoV disease journey are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other communities (which is HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show a more common picture of a community HCoV infection, which includes a picture of nonspecific symptoms that is mild or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small part of a severe COVID-19 case can look like SARS-CoV infection even with a slightly lower ratio.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmissions also show interesting characteristics of patterns, similar to HCoV communities and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 transmission capabilities are at least as high as HCoV community.
On the other hand, the decline in SARS-CoV-2 transmission capabilities after some of the human pathways still need to be verified, as is the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, just like the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a fess sample.
"Does SARS-CoV-2 transmission play a vital role, as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in certain situations, it must still be clarified by the next study."
The thing that's also very important to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is as seasonal as in the HCoV community case.
However, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmission abilities, pathogenicity, and continuous dispersion in some ways in humans, will have a profound effect on the final fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
Four HCoV communities that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
Judging from another point of view, it's safe to say that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may have been species of ancient HCoV pandemic survivors.
The HCoV that causes severe human and human illness has been destroyed.
In order for this to happen, HCoV must replicate in humans sufficiently to enable the accumulation of adaptive mutations to counter host restrictions.
Thus, the longer the plague of SARS-CoV-2 survives and the more infected people, the more likely this virus is to adapt fully to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four CoV communities circulated in the human population and triggered colds in people who were immune.
This virus doesn't require animal reservoirs.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are highly pathogenic yet to adapt to human beings and their transmissions in humans cannot be maintained.
Both have to defend themselves and reproduce in zoonotic reservoirs and look for opportunities to spread out to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or some of the host brokers and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has a description similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted like the HCoV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCoV community and not as photogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It must still be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt fully to human beings and circulate in humans without reservoir animals or intermediaries.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of evolutionary hosts, naturally, reservoirs, intermediaries, and HCoV applicants.
Animals act as an evolutionary host of HCoVs if they have close relatives and share high homologies at a nucleotide level.
The ancestral virus usually adapts well and is nonpatogenic in the host.
Similarly, the host of reservoirs carried HCoV on a continuous basis and over a long period of time.
In these two cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for HCoV or mother virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV had just entered the middleman right before or about the time the virus got into humans, the virus had not adapted to a new host and was often pathogenic.
It can serve as a source of human infection zoonotics and play the role of an applicant by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, then transmit it to humans to replicate the scale of human infections.
HCoV can develop a terminal infection if it can't maintain its transmission in the middleman's host.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to intermediary hosts and even cause long - term endemicity.
In this case, the middleman becomes a natural host.
epidemiological data reveals retrospectively that the case zero SARS has a record of contact with game animals.
Further seroprevalence studies indicate that the animal vendor has a higher anti-SARS-CoV prevalence than the general population.
Moon foxes (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the animal market live are the first to be identified with a virus similar to SARS-CoV which is almost identical to SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, it is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the foxes in the market were killed.
However, it is reported that moon foxes from the wild or farms not exposed to the living animal market are largely giving negative results to SARS-CoV.
For the record, since 80% of the various animals in Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it can't be ruled out that many small mammal species may also serve as carriers of SARS-CoV intermediaries.
All these hosts seem to be the late host of SARS-CoV.
The search for natural animals for SARS-CoV continues to reveal the close - knit CoV bat, called the Rhinolopus-family of HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-RatCoV HUK3), found in the Chinese horsespave bat.
This bat provides positive tests for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and sequences of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomes.
This CoV and other CoV bats share homology sequence nucleotide 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study becomes the foundation for a new concept that bats are host to the newly emerging human pathogen.
Some CoVs like SARS (SL-CoV) are also identified by bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotension 2 (ACE2) enzyme is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 from the bat fesses samples is shown using ACE2 bats, weasels, and humans as receptors to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the serum for SARS Convalescent patients can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest relative ancestor to SARS-CoV in bat, with a 95% homology of nucleotide sequence.
Despite its high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct mother virus SARS-CoV and bats are not live-reservoir SARS-CoV.
Phlogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoVs use the same host receptors, which are reptidil peptide 4 (DPP4), as the way into the virus.
The series of polymerase RNA hanging-RNA MERS-CoV is phylogenetic closer to its match in beta-CoV bats identified from Europe and Africa.
Until recently, no MERS-CoV has been found alive in a wild bat.
MERS-CoV and his next of kin CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% homology as a nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be direct reserve hosts MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab camels provide seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like Middle Eastern camels in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to a virus found in humans isolated from an Arab camel patch.
It's also important to note that massive viral decay with symptoms that are usually mildly observable on test camels infected with MERS-CoV.
For the record, the infected camels carried the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of viral decay from bats.
Nevertheless, questions remain unanswered because many of the MERS cases have no record of contact with camels prior to symptoms, possibly due to human-to-human transmissions or unknown transmission routes involving unknown species of animals carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% homology nucleotide with the RaTG13 CoV bat isolated from the Rhinolophus affinist bat.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 was too big to establish a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be live-reservoir SARS-CoV-2, unless the nearly identical CoV bats are discovered later on.
The host of SARS-CoV-2 is among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Sea Food Grocer Market.
Some recent studies based on metagenic sequences suggest that a group of small, endangered mammals, known as tris javanica, may also bring in an ancestral beta-coV relative to SARS-CoV-2.
This new CoV trilide genom shares 85-92% homology sequence nucleotide with SARS-CoV-2.
The CoV, however, is as close to RaTG13 as 90% of the size of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two sublines of a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain that is more like SARS-CoV-2, with similar amino acid sequences of 97.4%.
Inconspicuously, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are much more different, although homology levels throughout the genome are higher.
The previous study on the grinder also reported the virus detection contiguous from the lung sample, which turned out to be also related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted a different method of programming and manual quasi to produce a partial sequence of about 86.3% of the virus’s genome complete.
We can't rule out the possibility of the mill as one of SARS-CoV-2's middlemen.
However, no evidence currently supports SARS-CoV-2 comes directly from the grinder due to the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV's relatives-SARS-CoV-2 mills.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path SARS-CoV-2 in bats, grinders, and other mammals must still be set.
Although the highest homology in RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 grinders, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 share the highest homology in the entire genome.
Too speculated that the high level of resemblance between the RBD beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 grinder and SARS-CoV-2 was moved by the intervential evolution of being mediated.
Competitive hypothesis supports recombination between beta-coV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 trgilling and RatG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a factor in the driving of evolution, recombination is common among beta-CoVs.
Researchers still can't decide where SARS-CoV-2 came from.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, the origins of the zoonotic HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phlogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated with CoV bats, while the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HCU1 virus were found in rodents.
It is reported that the CoV bat called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) was detected on a three-colored North American bat showing close ties to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another CoV bat, under the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae is also thought to be its intermediary host.
To be clear, the current knowledge of the origin of known HCoV animals is simplified in Images 1 and Table 2.
Phlogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the events of the HCoV interspecies transmission in history.
In about 1890, when HCoV-OC43 passed species of cattle to infect humans, there was a record of a respiratory infection pandemic.
The HCoV-229E transmission history of interspecies is not very clear.
Alpha-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between the two, there's an alpha-coV alpaca.
Some evidence supports the transmission of the virus directly from the bats to the humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, who may be in contact with bats in the ecological rails together.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, the alpha-coV bats related to HCoV-229E are diverse and nonpathogenic in bats, while alpha-coV alpaca causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-coV alpaca wasn't found in the feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaca getting alpha-coV relatives-HCoV-229E from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Tohru virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while the alpha-CoV bats serve as the sloth of the HCoV-229E gene, alpacas and Arabian camels may serve as intermediaries that transmit viruses to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example for interspecies transmission from bats to Arabian camels and from Arabian camels to humans.
The origin of the evolutionary MERS-CoV of the bats is known to early identification of the virus and also amplified by later findings.
It's obvious that bats are the gutters of rich virus species for the exchange of genetic fragments between species and interspecies transmissions.
Long lives, close colonies, close social interactions, and strong flying skills, are all conditions that support bats to become ideal viral spreaders.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been on the Arabian camel for decades.
This virus has adapted to camels that have gone from intermediary host to stable, natural host reserves.
MERS-CoV causes very mild diseases and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
The sporadic transmission to humans happens by chance and humans remain the final host for MERS-CoV because the transmission can't continue.
Unlike the role of the camel in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of the grinder, if any, in a different SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Mainly, beta-coV grinder is highly pathogenic in the grinder.
The grinder may be the final host for SARS-CoV's relative SARS-CoV-2, similar to the weasel in the SARS-CoV case.
In future studies, some possible transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 interspecies from animals to humans must be calculated or ruled aside.
First of all, bats could have been a reservoir host for the SARS-CoV-2 relative virus that was almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological rails with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, the grinder could have been one of the carriers for the recent SARS-CoV-2 relative virus.
Humans get the virus through slaughter and intake of game meat.
It's possible, many mammals, which include pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody surveys against pets and wild animals need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that are either in contact with bats or through mills.
SARS-CoV-2 animal search continues.
Despite the various animal host types, three major factors on the side of the virus are also important to make it easier for CoV to cross species barriers.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to another single-striped RNA virus, estimates of a CoV mutation rate can be considered "medial" to "high" at an average rate of ~10-4 per year, depending on a new host adaptation phase.
CoV has an exorbitant correction, elimination that results in very high mutability, atenuation, or even inviability.
The interesting thing is, the epilogue nucleotide Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through this exoribunuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Even so, the rate of CoV mutations is about a million times higher than the rate of host mutations.
In addition, mutation rates are often high when CoV has not adapted to host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high rate of mutation, the mutation rate SARS-CoV-2 is actually lower, signaling a higher adaptation rate with humans.
Likely, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies to MERS-CoV which has adapted to Arab camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift will quickly make vaccines and antivirus agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the great RNA genome in CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the co-evolutionability of interspecies, which is profitable for the emergence of the new CoV when conditions fit.
This is supported by the vast number of unique open - read skeletons and protein functions encoded at the end of the three genomes.
Third, CoVs change templates randomly during RNA replication through unique "selective-copy" mechanisms.
In hosts that serve as blending containers, strand transitions often occur during CoV RNA transcription.
Full RNA and highly homologous subgenogenics can experience recombination to form a new CoV.
Physical phylogenetic evidence of recombination has been found on HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as has CoV animals like SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
Virus-intrusion interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptors is another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
Here, SARS-CoV recombination is considered a typical example, which also shows positive selection evidence during the transmission of interspecies.
Based on a computational analysis between the Isolat SARS-CoV man and weasel, SARS-CoV is suspected to have rapid adaptation in various hosts, especially with mutations in RBD protein S.
Generally, RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and is an intensive target of host antibodies.
At SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment, which ties to ACE2 humans and their correceptors as the path to the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize various ACE2 receptors of animals, which include bats, weasels, rats, and raccoon dogs, allowing transmission of interspecies viruses.
In fact, only six amino acid residues are observed different between the isolats of the human virus and the weasels in RBD and 4 of which are located at the motive for the receptor binding for interaction with the ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV weasel has a mutation of K479N and S487T in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of protrusion protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important to adapt the virus to humans.
It's worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit implies affinity for S protein bindings with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows the affinity of human ACE2 bindings and S SARS-CoV-2 proteins 10 to 20 times higher than affinity between ACE2 humans and S SARS-CoV proteins.
The important thing to know is whether there are other coresaptors that might be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
The interesting thing is, HCoV-NL63 is also bonded with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as the aminopeptide N for HCoV-229E and the 9-O-terseclation acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the successful CoV adaptation in humans after the interspecies transmission of the animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the final outcome of the HCoV interspecies transmission is also regulated by dependency factors and other host restrictions.
The difference between human protein and the host of natural reservoirs, such as bats, Arabian camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoV must take over the host's dependency factors and break the host's restricted factors in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular specifiers in the field of interactions of these important viruses must still be identified and characterized.
The entire genome’s fiscal fission is inoperable to see the dependency factors and restrictions of SARS-CoV-2 using the most advanced CRISPR technology might be useful.
The emergence of a new HCoV: back to the beginning of the plague.
CoV's variety of bats gives us great opportunity for a new HCoV.
In this case, the CoV bats serve as the sloth of the HCoV gene.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also move HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, obtaining or losing a new protein encoder gene has potentially dramatically modified the fenotype of the virus.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, the ORF8 is suspected to play an important role in adapting to humans because of the contracted SARS-CoV-bat virus found in a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a distinctive signature of the removal of 29 nucleotides was found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal separates ORF8 from ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be a adaptive mutation that supports host transition.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV bloodlines and gamma-CoVs, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in the polymerase RNA that depends on RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partly nsp14.
Similarly, the recombination between the various lineages was shown during the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in Saudi Arabia’s camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recombination incident has also been observed on other HCoVs where HCoV has recombinated with other animals in its non-structureal genes.
It must also be feared that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes in the viral genome, likely due to the release of the virus from the pressures of selection, such as by the host's immune system.
This example of effect is the complete loss of ORF4 on the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the removal of two nucleotides.
While the ORF4 can be observed in bat viruses and camels related to HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV alpaca shows a single nucleotide insert that causes the shift of the skeleton.
Finally, the new HCoV evolution is also driven by the pressures of selection in its host.
Symptoms are mild or without symptoms detected when the bats are infected with CoV, which suggests adaptation between CoV and bats.
The bats seem to adapt well to CoV in anatomy and physiology.
For example, defects in the activation of proinflammatory responses to bats will bring down the pathology that CoV triggered efficiently.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells on bats is suppressed because of the increased regulations of natural killer cell receptors of NKG2/CD94 inhibitors and the level of molecular expression of histocompatibility major class I complexes.
In addition, high levels of oxygen reactive (ROS) from high bat metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and affect correction by exorizonuclease and thus put the selection of strains for highly pathogenic strains when entering a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also develop through recombination, resulting in new protein gain or features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpatogenic or cause mild symptoms in their host reserves, such as bats and camels.
CoV replicates strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
Here lies the secret to the unsuspecting carrier and the cause of heavy cases of human infection.
Heavy symptoms especially because of excessive immune responses and cytokines, with increased lung damage if the immune responses become stronger.
On the other hand, on the carriers without symptoms, the immune response has been released from CoV replication.
The same strategy to disconnect the immune response may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially strong on bats.
Therefore, the gift of type I interferon, at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
Moreover, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammatory bats is effective.
For this reason, inflammation of the NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in handling COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the common plot of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-coV bats that share 95% homology nucleotide with SARS-CoV have been found, there is also a CoV bat that shares 96% homology nucleotide with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the fox and other animals in the market were found carrying a virus identical to SARS-CoV, the host's direct intermediary for SARS-CoV-2 has not been found.
The very homologous Beta-CoV traviller with SARS-CoV-2 has been discovered, indicating that the trind may play a role as one of the mediums or beta-coV trlinders may contribute the gene fragments at the end of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still in question, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans either deliberately or by accident.
CoV has been the center of attention since the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have greatly altered our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs for HCoV on human transmissions.
Very much evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 came from bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediary hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection came from contact between humans and weasels in the wet market, probably closing the wet market and killing all the foxes in it that effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, the grinder should have been moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmissions, given the discovery of some of the beta-CoV trilger bloodlines that were closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, truths and mechanisms SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted to humans through the tramlin and other mammals still need to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been on Arab camels for a long time.
The camel serves as an important means of transportation as well as as a primary source of meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local people.
Arab camels are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we can't kill all the camels to control MERS, as did in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach must be made to develop a vaccine for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we get rid of this virus, a new genotype can emerge and cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs circulated in the wild.
In particular, the potential zoonotic CoV bats vary widely.
There are many possibilities for this zoontic cov to evolve and recombination, resulting in the emergence of a new cov which is easier to transmit and/or more deadly to the future of humans.
Culture eats wild animals in some parts of China has to be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 experience, better preparation and countermeasures should be applied.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet since ancient times.
These viruses are in their natural reservoirs until there's a chance to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics supporting the spread of the virus, human opportunities of contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to avoid wild animals.
Consistent surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural host, which will prove beneficial in preventing transmissions of animals-to-humans and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to keep their distance from the natural ecological reservoir of the zoonotic virus.
Some parts of the riddle from SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic puzzle have yet to be found.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral virus SARS-CoV-2 to the grinder, the condition when bats and trmills share the ecological rally is important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans contact bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that plays the role of a real medium host, the way it interacts with other species, which include humans, bats, and trgrills must be explained.
Finally, because of many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental and surveillance infections must be done.
Whether the bats, the grinders, or other mammals, are expected that SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical mother virus can be identified in its future natural host.
The ongoing investigation in this field will outline the path of evolutionary SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with crucial implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updates of "expected case" diagnostic criteria and "confirmed case" COVID-19 need to be performed
On February 6, 2020, our team published quick counsel guides for diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV). These guides are based on our experience and are good references to the worldwide pandemic.
Even so, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing on the basis of ongoing research findings and clinical practical experiences; therefore, diagnostic strategies and treatment are also being updated.
In this letter, we answered one of the comments on our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "insurgible cases" and "confirmed cases" based on the Diagnosis Guide and Treatment to COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) had caused an outbreak, which is now formally called coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and is named coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infections, our team developed a quick guidance guide and that guide was published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
That guide has drawn a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it is worth noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing by ongoing research findings and clinical practical experiences; hence, diagnostic strategies and treatment are also being renewed.
For example, between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts being changed quite a lot.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al, they introduced a simple score-giving proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence for our guidance as well as a valuable reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
Nevertheless, their work also requires updates based on the Diagnosis Guide and Control for the latest COVID-19 (the seventh trial version) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (March 3 of 2020), to confirm the alleged case requires a combination of one of epidemiological historys with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or a need for the completion of three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or living in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where the case COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days before the symptoms awitan; (2) contact with cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid tests); (3) contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days before the symptoms; (4) a history of contact with clustered cases of confirmed cases (1 case with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurred in 2 weeks in small areas, like home, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging features COVID-19 infection; (3) total count of white blood cells indicates normal lymphocyte count, decreased, or decreased at the initial rate.
Diagnosing a confirmed case must be based on an alleged case with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive PCR real-time test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the whole sequence of viral genomes indicates high homogenity for the known new coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM antibody and IgG antibody against SARS-COV-2 in serum tests; or changes of Ig-specific Ig-CoV-2 antibody from negative to positive, or titer increases its rise in recovery at an acute rate.
We can see that PCR's real-time nucleic acid tests in a sample of the respiratory tract or blood were added to the second edition (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
The pathogenic detection of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the ongoing research of researchers to find optimum nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the breathing channel including blood-grafting, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports the integrating of certain antibody positives into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us to be alert to patients with animative symptoms and without symptoms.
Therefore, the Zhou et al flow chart must be renewed because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in future clinical practices and studies.
In closing, we expect more direct evidence to appear and ask the reader to comment.
For the diagnosis of "surprised cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that we follow and comply with the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also update our guidelines periodically as help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths caused by COVID-19, the highest daily mortality rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths caused by COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest mortality rate in one day due to the virus.
Up until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of cases of infections recorded including 114 active cases and 33 recovering cases living at home.
It's a total of 17 deaths.
In an online news briefing, director IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said death covers four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadulu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Prouption Commission, who was hospitalized at Kuwait's Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, the Minister of Transportation Roads and Bridges, Obadul Quader says public transportation will be stopped longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This stop of public transportation has started since March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential goods -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still permitted.
The first recorded incident of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, on two people who had just returned from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
By March 19th, the three people had been cured.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections exceeds a million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the corona virus.
The peak occurred on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first corona virus infection and Zambia had its first death related to the corona virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain freed from corona's viral infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty - four hours since 10 am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, there are more than 244 thousand cases of corona virus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office reports that, quoting Johns Hopkins University's data, there are over 1,000 deaths in the U.S. as a result of corona virus infection.
Worldwide, countries are announcing more strict measures to inhibit the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the circuit quarantine until May 1st.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russian citizens would remain paid without going to work until April 30th.
Portugal's Parliament voted to extend national emergency status for 15 days; the vote got away with 215 support votes, ten abstain votes, and one vote refused.
Saudi Arabia extends the curfew in Mecca's holy city and Medina until all day; before, the curfew occurred only between 3 p.m. and 6 am.
Thailand plans on implementing a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4am.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended an order of residence until May 1th.
Stores in Australia reduce the purchase of toilet paper per transaction
On Sundays and Saturdays afternoons, Australia's Woolworth and Coles stores each lower the cost of buying toilet paper up to two and one packs per transaction at all stores at a national level.
ALDI also implements a pack limit, on Mondays.
These restrictions were announced as a message at the cashier and on his network Facebook page.
Buyers are reported to pile up supplies caused by COVID-19 fear that people should do self-insurgency.
On Wednesdays, Woolworths also limits the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes followed the restrictions of four packs per transaction previously applied by Woolworths and Coles each on March 4 and 5th.
On his media release on March 8th, Coles reported that with four pack restrictions, "many stores still run out within an hour of shipping", and called the request "never before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unpredictable".
last week's sale of "increasing sharp", according to one of Woolworths' spokespersons.
Costco's shop in Canberra also limits the amount allowed up to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered a larger package of suppliers and increased the delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for the special Wednesday promotion activity was available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australiantel Association, said that the retailer tried to improve supplies, but the local government limit for truck delivery time made it difficult.
He anticipated rising production costs, while suppliers tried to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that having dropped supplies earlier, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the store was stocking every night.
He stressed that toilet paper was large volumes so that the supply supply was low and, if sold out, made a lot of space on the shelves so that the scarcity of goods increased.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet paper and an analytical tissue [buy] and there's a huge amount, panic may be minimized, says Russell Zimmerman through the ABC News Office.
The production of recycled toilet paper Who Givens a Crap said on Wednesdays ago that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, stressed they worked 24/7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au reports.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reports that some proprietors offer free toilet paper to the first bidder auction in Melbourne, when fewer auctions are held because buyers take breaks for the weekend off Labor Day.
The Thursday NT News edition, a daily printed in Darwin, included eight pages of incision intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were actually reluctant to apply the boundaries, according to Australia's ABC report on March 3rd, they said that they were not planning on implementing purchase boundaries.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high demand, including masks, acquiescion, dry food, handwash, and flour.
Likewise outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British online supermarket Ocado was observed limiting the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 outbreak-- the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus-- as a pandemic.
Although the word "spoil" refers only to how widespread the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO recorded the need to encourage the government to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the state detects, tests, deals, isolates, and mobilizes its people in response, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebrreysus, Director General of WHO.
We were very concerned because of the level of dispersal and severity both for fear and for the severity of alarming actions.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic has never happened before.
It says, in a note published by CNN in February, "besides influenza, there is no respiratory virus that has ever been tracked from its appearance to its ongoing global spread."
Ghebrenesus expressed a similar view, saying "We've never seen a pandemic triggered by the coronavirus."
He goes, "and we've never seen a controlable pandemic at the same time."
The new status of the pandemic followed the WHO's decision in January that declared this epidemic an emergency of the world’s troubled public.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this epidemic, "The beginning is, this epidemic is going to get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) which is being continued and caused by acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Pestilence was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a World Health Emergency on January 30, 2020, and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
Up to April 10, 2020, about 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territory, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have been cured.
Case fatalities are estimated 4% in China, while worldwide range from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and asphyxiation.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
Time from exposure to symptoms is generally about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There are no known vaccines or specific antivirus treatments yet.
The primary treatment of cymptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive acts include washing hands, keeping your mouth shut when coughing, keeping your distance from others, and monitoring and isolation independent for those who are thought to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by enforcing travel limits, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control, and closing facilities.
This pandemic has caused severe social disorder in global economics, delays or cancellations in cultural, political, religious, sports, and the vast scarcity of goods that are compounded with panic purchases.
Schools and universities have been shut down at both national and local levels in 193 countries, which affect about 99.4 percent of the population of students worldwide.
Misinformation on this virus has spread online and there are xenophobia incidents and discrimination against Chinese people, people with the descendants and appearances of East and Southeast Asia, and people from areas with significant viral cases.
As a result of heavy travel reductions and industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (Hhudei province capital), reported a cluster case of pneumonia with an unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation conducted in early January 2020.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Sea Food Grocery Market and therefore the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, a virus that has just been discovered and related to the bat coronavirus, the mill coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms is known to fall ill on December 1, 2019, and that person has no direct connection to the later known wet market cluster.
Among the initial cluster cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found connected to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be traced to November 17, 2019, on a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was probably the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with new cases reported dropping in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with lighter symptoms.
Up to 26th February, relatively few cases reported among young men, with 19 years of age and under form 2.4% of cases worldwide.
The case refers to the number of people who have been tested by COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
Up to 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, Holland, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, up to January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that this undocumented infection was the source of infection for 79% documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the rate of infection in Italy is estimated to be greater than the case reported.
The initial estimate of basic reproductive numbers (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was probably 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are cured.
For those who don't recover, time from symptoms development to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been associated with COVID-19.
In China, up to February 5, 80 percent of deaths occur in people over 60 years of age and 75% have preexisting health disorders, which include cardiovascular and diabetes. The official mortality rate of COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to the deceased who gave positive tests for COVID according to official protocols.
The real fatality of COVID-19 may be much higher, given the official number of possibilities of not including untested deaths, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
The partial data from Italy found that the excess number of death rates during the pandemic surpassed official COVID mortality calculations with a factor of 4-5 times that.
A spokeswoman for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) U.S. admits, "We know that [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual figure", a statement strengthened by non-scientific reports about overcalamity in the U.S., which often occurs in pandemics, as in the 2009 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of mainland China occurred on February 1st in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14th.
Until February 28th, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Up to March 13th, more than forty countries and territory had reported deaths, on every continent, except Antarctica.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are affected by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, management options, time since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of deaths to cases reflects the number of cases diagnosed in a specified interval of time.
According to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the ratio of deaths to cases globally is 6.0% (97.039/1,617,204) per April 10, 2020.
These numbers vary according to the region.
In China, estimates of the death ratio to the case decreased from 17.3% (for people with symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms abbreviated after February 1, 2020). Other measurements include case fatality rates (CFR), which reflect the percentage of diagnosed people who died of certain diseases, and the fatality rate of infections (IFR), which reflect the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
Centre for Education-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the fatality rate of infection for the overall pandemic between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate range is in line with the result of the first random testing of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical research that analyzes the impact of service at CFR estimates.
WHO confirms that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and end duration of the outbreak are unclear and may differ according to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states: “Even without being controlled, infectious plagues are usually horizontal and then begin to decline when the disease runs out of available host.
However, it's almost impossible to make a reasonable projection at this point of when it happened."
China's senior medical advisor Zhong Nanshan argues that "this epidemic may end June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on how to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17th, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine declared that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for a year or two."
According to Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures will be needed "until vaccines are available (probably 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I don't think it's possible that this coronavirus, because it's so easily transmitted, can disappear completely" and this "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Repetition virulence will depend on group immunity and mutation rates.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific and the infected can be without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the production of respiratory spputum (flagma), the loss of smell, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, throat pain, headache, shivering, vomiting, hemoptys, diarrhea, or cyanide.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) include emergency symptoms involving difficulty breathing, chest pressures or chest pains, sudden confusion, trouble walking, and bluishness in the face and lips; medical attention is immediately advised if these symptoms arise. Further developments can be severe pneumonia, acute breathing syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some infected people may be asimtomatic, which is without clinical symptoms, but with tests that confirm infection, therefore, researchers suggest that those who are close to infected should be closely monitored and checked to make sure that they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate asimtomatic ratios range from some to 44%.
The period of incubation (the time between infection and symptom awitan) usually ranges from 1 to 14 days, at most 5 days.
Details of the way this disease spreads are still being examined.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to be primarily during close contact and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is between 1 and 2 feet [3 to 6 feet].
Studies have found that unclosed cough can cause a droplet to be driven up to 30 feet [4.5 m] [15 m] [8.2 m]].
Some researchers estimate that viruses may also be transmitted by smaller, longer-lasting droplets in the air and are produced when talking.
Droplets can fall on the mouth or noses of people who are nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and lung heart resuscitation (RJP), can cause a small respiratory sect to turn into an aerosol and then spread through the air.
The spread can also occur when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and touches the eye, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that viruses can spread through fesses, these risks are believed to be low.
The Chinese government rejected the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 transmission was partially transmitted. Virus was most contagious in the first three days after symptoms, although the spread may occur before the symptoms are visible and at a further stage of disease.
People have tested positive for up to three days before symptoms, signaling transmissions may occur prior to significant symptoms.
Few reports of asimtomatic cases are confirmed labs, but asimtomatic infections have been identified by some countries during search for contact.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it's not entirely clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person is generally infected with two to three others, the virus can last on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, viruses can be detected for up to three days in plastic (polipropilen) and rust - resistant steel 304, one day in cardboard, and more than four hours in copper.
However, these vary depending on moisture and temperature, pets and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit viruses to humans, although British authorities suggest that they wash their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that might have been touched by infected people.
Coronaviruses of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with cluster cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus associated with the natural coronavirus, outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed if exposed to domestic soap, which dissolves its protective envelope.
The virus is thought to have the origin of the zoonotic.
Genetic analysis reveals that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the Betacoronavirus gene, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (b line) along with two galurs of bat descent.
This virus has 96% in common at the entire genome with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in one amino acid in certain parts of the genome sequence between the grinder virus and the human virus.
To date, the whole ratio of genomes has found that at most 92% of the genetic material in common between the mill's coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, it's not enough to prove that the mill is the host of SARS-CoV-2 brokers.
Infection by a virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is eventually done by the reaction of a retransception polymerase chain (RRT-PRC) on an infected secret or plastering CT imaging.
A study that compares PCR with CT in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with the many imaging features that overlap with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT must not be used for filtering or as the first test line in diagnosing COVID-19."
WHO has published some RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were first distributed on January 17th.
Testing using polymerase chain reaction real-time transcription (RRRT-PRC).
Tests can be done on breathing samples or blood.
The results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test was conducted on a nasofaring steam, but it was also possible to wipe the throat, and a number of labs and companies were developing serological tests that detected antibodies.
Per April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests have proved accurate enough to be approved for extensive use.
In the U.S., the serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified labs.
Characteristics of radiography imaging features and amputated tomography (CT) in people whose symtomatics include ground glass perimetry opacity and no pleura efusi.
Italian Radiological Society is putting together an international online database for imagery findings on confirmed cases.
Because of overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation PCR has limited specsisity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although less specific for infection, imaging was faster and more sensitive to being considered as a filter in the epidemic area.
The artificial intelligence-based neural network has been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
The strategy to prevent the disease from spreading involves comprehensively keeping good personal cleanness, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and using tissues when coughing or sneezing and throwing tissues into the trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical restrictions are also recommended to prevent transmission, and governments in various areas have restricted or urged to stop all nonessential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a rate of dispersal of society in most of the world.
This means that viruses have spread across society, and some members of society don't know where or how they're infected. health care providers who deal with people who may be infected are advised to perform standard prevention, contact prevention and eye protection.
The use of cell phone data by the government for this purpose has sparked a privacy problem, with the release of Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Cellular applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and on April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked on friendly privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
In turn, users will receive a message if they are close to someone who is tested positive for COVID-19. There are misunderstandings about how to prevent infection; for example, sanding noses and gargling with mouthwash is ineffective.
There hasn't been a COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing hands is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after toilets or when hands look dirty; before eating; and after breaking their noses, coughing, or sneezing.
This encouragement is because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by domestic soap that damaged its protective layer.
Further, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol - based hand analysing with at least 60% of alcohol based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (in a minute exposure to rust-resistant steel surface), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorit 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7,5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexdin glalonat, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are cases of alleged COVID or confirmed in public facilities, such as offices or daycare facilities, all areas as offices, bathrooms, public areas, common electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote control, and ATM machines used by sufferers should be disinfected.
The health organization recommends that people cover their mouth and nose with bent elbows or use tissues when coughing or sneezing, and then immediately remove the tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and distance of the explosive droplets scattered when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on the time and manner of masking.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch faces with their hands that are not clean enough, which is the main source of infection."
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who treat COVID-19, although WHO also recognizes that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to encourage the use of masks to members of society.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends using a nonmedical face mask made of fabric, China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to healthy communities, especially when close to one foot (3 m) or less) to another.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask when using public transportation or living in a crowded place.
Thai health officials encouraged people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech and Slovak Republic forbids people from going out into public places without wearing masks or covering their noses and mouths.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear facial masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government requires that everyone entering the department store wear facial masks.
Israel asks all its citizens to wear facial masks when they're in public.
Taiwan, which produces ten million masks a day since mid - March, requires train and intercity buses to wear facial masks per April 1.
Panama requires the use of facial masks whenever outside the house, as well as recommends making homemade facial masks for those who cannot afford facial masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restrictions (also called physical restrictions) are an act of infection control intended to slow the spread of diseases by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social restrictions include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply social restrictions by living at home, limiting travel, avoiding public areas, using greetings without contact, and keeping physical distance from others.
At present, many governments require or appeal to social restrictions in areas where there is an outbreak.
The maximum number of people gathered by U.S. government agencies and health organizations quickly decreased, starting with 250 people (if unknown, COVID-19 distribution in one region) became 50 people, and then 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in the public area that involved more than two people. Elderia and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and disruptive immune systems that had a serious risk of illness and higher complications were advised by the CDC to stay in the home alone in areas where the plague was at a public level. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to change the use of the term "social restrictions" to make sure that the goal was to reduce physical contact by maintaining social relations, whether virtually or from a distance.
The use of the term "social boundary" suggests that people have to completely isolate themselves socially and not encourage people to keep in touch with others through alternative ways.
This recommendation includes the encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-religion in the home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
The health agencies have issued detailed instructions for self-insurgency.
The strictest instruction of self-insurgency is issued to people who belong to high risk groups.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19 and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with extensive distribution of COVID-19 are advised to conduct a 14 - day self - quarantine since the time of the last display.
The strategy for disease control is containment or support, as well as mitigation.
Containment was performed in the early stages of the outbreak and intended to track and isolate infected people and take other steps to control infections and vaccinations that aim to stop the spread of disease across the population.
When it is no longer possible to stem the spread of disease, the next attempt to move on to the mitigation stage: these steps are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health and community care systems.
Combination of containment and mitigation can be done at the same time.
It takes more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive rate to less than 1. The part of infectious disease management is trying to lower the peak of the epidemic, which is known as causing an epidemic curve.
It lowers the risk of being overwhelmed by health care and gives more time to vaccine development and medicine.
Non-farmary interventions to deal with outbreaks include individual precautions, such as hand sanitization, wearing facial masks, and self-contained quarantines; steps at the level of society intended for physical restrictions, like closing schools and canceling mass gatherings; public engagements to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions as environmental measures, such as surface cleaning. Other drastic measures intended to prevent outbreaks in China when the severity of the plague is becoming more real, such as quarantined throughout the city and implementing strict travel restrictions.
Other countries also apply various steps aimed at limiting the spread of viruses.
South Korea introduced mass filtration and local quarantine, and issued warnings about the movement of the infected.
Singapore provides financial support for the infected who carry out self - quarantine and charges huge fines for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan boosted facial mask production and punished the hoarder of medical supplies. The simulations for Britain and the United States indicate that mitigation (slowing, but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and compression (reversing the growth of epidemics) had great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policy can reduce demand for health care by 2/3 and death by half, but it still causes hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Succession can be selected, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until vaccines are available, if this is the first one reached), because otherwise, infection will leap back up quickly as the pressure steps are released.
Long-term interventions to suppress pandemics have had an impact on social and economics.
No specific antivirus drugs have yet been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are under way, which include existing drug testing.
Taking free - selling cold drugs, drinking enough water, and resting can help ease the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravene fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can exacerbate the patient’s condition.
Some compounds previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in treating COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and home medicine" can ease the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that increasing the capacity and adapting health care to the needs of a patient of COVID-19 is a basic step in responding to the epidemic.
ECDC and the European regional WHO offices have issued guidelines for hospitals and health services to divert resources at various levels, including focusing on lab services for COVID-19 testing, if possible undoing elective procedures, separating and isolated positive patients of COVID-19, and improving intensive care skills by training personnel and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are theories about the origin of the first case (called patient zero).
The first known new case of coronavirus can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are largely related to the Huanan Sea Food Grocery Market, which also sells living animals, and one theory says that the virus originated from one of these animals; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A pneumonia cluster with an unknown cause was observed on December 26th and handled by Dr. Zhang Jixian in Hubei Province Hospital, which told the CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30th, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital told their colleagues about the SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and others, Ai Fen, were reprimanded by his superior because of the warning he issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31st and informed WHO.
In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during Lunar New Year and because Wuhan was a transportation center and the main railway transit site.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on January 20, 2020.Per March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest confirmed cases in the world, up to April 9, 2020, more than 1,61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have been cured.
About 200 countries and territory have at least one case.
Because of pandemics in Europe, many countries in the Schengen region limit free movement and create border control.
National responses include measures of containment, such as quarantine (known as housekeeping, shelter order, or regional quarantine) and curfew.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in a type of regional quarantine, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about one third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report shows the earliest case on November 17th.
Dr Zhang Jixian observed the pneumonia cluster case with an unknown cause on December 26; this observation was made clear to the Jianghan CDC on December 27.
The initial genetic testing of the patient's samples on December 27, 2019 indicates the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
Public announcement was released by the Wuhan City Health Commission on December 31st.
WHO was told the same day.
When this notice was made, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police for spreading rumors about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China at first claimed that there was no "evident evidence" transmission from man to man.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by the secretary - general of the Communist Party Xi Jinping as "the civil war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In a quarantine called "the greatest quarantine in human history", cordon sanitaire or cleaning restrictions were announced on January 23 to stop the journey in and out of Wuhan, and expanded to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, which affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited inside the city.
The Lunar New Year celebration (January 25) was canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of the temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Other hospitals were also built after Leishenshan Hospital to handle additional patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China also changed 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.
All the universities and schools in the country are also closed.
The Hong Kong region and Macau apply a few steps, especially in terms of schools and universities.

In March 2020, worldwide and at different levels, museums, libraries, show places, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with exhibitions, events, and performances canceled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services via digital platforms, and other adverse effects of this disease are the recent and highly developed cancellation of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as musical festivals and concerts, technological conferences, and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week celebration in Rome, which fell in the last week of the Prapask Christian conversion season, was canceled.
Many diocese encourages Christian older ones to stay home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services by radio, live broadcasts online or television, while others offer drive-ins or landscape worship.
With churches and chapel closed by the Roman Catholic archdiocese and the emptying of St. Peter's Square of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and restricted public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwara.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced a cancelation of prayer on Fridays in areas where plagues and places of worship were then shut down, while Saudi Arabia forbade foreign pilgrims and its inhabitants from entering the sanctuaries of Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic has caused the most significant disturbance to the worldwide sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events are canceled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-2020, Premier League 2019-2020, EUFA Euro 2020, NBA season 2019-2020, and NHL season 2019-2020.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020th Summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but it would not be more than 2021." Around the world, casinos and other games are closed and live broadcast poker tournaments are postponed or canceled.
This has led many gamblers to move to online gambling, many online gambling sites report significant increase in registration, and entertainment industries have also been affected, with various musical groups delaying or canceling concert tours.
A lot of big theaters like Broadway also delay all the performances.
Artists explore ways to continue producing and sharing works through the Internet as an alternative to traditional live shows, such as online live broadcast concerts or making web-based festivals for artists to perform, distribute, and publish their works.
Many coronavirus-themed Internet memes are spread online with many who turn to humor and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against Chinese and Eastern Asia, as well as against people from the affected regions of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The events of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and Asia-Pacific.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases are still limited in China) record the racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world that Chinese people deserve the virus or accept what they claim as a proper reward.
Some countries in Africa also experience increased anti-Tongkok sentiments.
Many Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their locality.
There's already support for Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in the area that are exposed to the virus.
Following the development of outbreaks to new hotspots, Italians, the first countries in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, can also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan is trending on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in Great Britain and the United States reported increasing rates of racial harassment and assault.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus the Chinese virus, a term that critics consider to be racist and anti-Tongkok.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeast India, bordering China, and studying in major Indian cities are reported to have been abused by coronavirus outbreaks.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a state unit in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh states that China has destroyed nature and that's why God has avenged them.
The statement was then denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, by calling it "squeamish." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Tinonghoa residents blazed because of the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "disposal."
Many newspapers that use pay - off inhibitions have removed it for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers make scientific papers related to epidemics available with open access.
Some scientists choose to quickly share the results on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Lab testing for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed with the RT-PCC, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This testing is specific and designed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA alone.
This test was used to confirm a new infection or still active.
Antibody detection can be used for population diagnosis and surveillance.
Antibody tests indicate the number of infected people, including those with too few symptoms to report or without symptoms.
The vitality of an accurate disease and the rate of group immunity in the population can be determined by the results of this test.
Because of limited testing, up to March 2020, no country has a reliable data on viral prevalence in its population.
Until March 23rd, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there's a huge variation in the number of tests that countries have done.
This variety may also significantly affect the fatality rate of a reported case, which is likely calculated too high in some countries.
Using a polymerase chain reaction of real-time transcriptions (RRRT-PRC), this test can be done on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including memorization of nasofaring or stputum samples.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PRC tests performed on the larynx are only reliable in the first week of disease.
Eventually, the virus can disappear in the throat while it keeps replicating in the lungs.
Alternatively, for an infected person tested in the second week, sample material can be drawn from an inhalation channel by using a catheter smoke or material released through cough (sputum).
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the reaction to the real-time transcription chain, and forming at least 250,000 test tools to distribute by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a test on January 23, 2020. Kogebiotech South Korea company developed a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection device (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
This device is looking for the "E" gene that belongs to all the beta coronavirus, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group is one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for PCR-CoV-2 detection devices. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Panels (CDC) distributes the RT-PCR Real-Time Koronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to the public health lab via International Reage.
One of the three genetic tests on the old version of the test provides an inconspicuous result of the reagen error, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta is limited; this results in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and until then the state lab and local labs were allowed to do tests.
This test was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, based on the authorization of Emergency Use, the U.S. commercial laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
Per March 5, 2020, LabCorp announces the availability of test COVID-19 based on the RT-PC on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made the COVID-19 test available nationally on March 9, 2020.
There is no limit to the announced quantity; the collection and processing of specimens must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the Virological and Biotechnological State Research Center.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care.
On March 19th 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the m2000 Abbott system; FDA had issued the same authorization to Hypologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cephid also received EUA from the FDA for testing that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses non-PCR nucleic amplification technology.
Since it does not require a series of temperature - changing cycles, it can produce positive results within just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott is expecting to increase production by up to 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use monoclonal antibodies specifically binding the new nucleokapsid protein (the N protein) coronavirus are being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it will produce results within 15 to 20 minutes like quick influenza tests.
A review of the library published in March 2020 concluded that "photo thorax photos have a small diagnostic value in the early stages, as well as CT findings [compared tomography] may have existed before the symptoms.
Special features of CT include ground-glass multilobar bilateral opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and posterior.
Subpleura, crazy paving, and consolidations are formed as disease develops.
In Wuhan, a study that compares PCR with CT's current point of origin shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many imaging features overlap with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT must not be used for filtering or as a first-line test in diagnosing COVID-19." In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial filtering.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals since about 7 days after symptoms awitans, to determine immune to disease, and in population surveillance. Tests can be performed in central labs (CLT) or by testing point-of-care (PoCT).
The automated system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these checks, but the availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT, commonly used one specimen of peripheral blood, although a series of specimens can be used to follow immune responses.
For PoCT, commonly used one peripheral blood specimen obtained through a skin prick.
Unlike the PCR method, the extraction was not necessary before the examination. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provided a notification to the agency as necessary and therefore were able to distribute their antibodies.
On April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA based on the authorization of emergency use.
The capacity for testing up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so it's much faster than conventional PCR checks on viral RNA.
Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after infections, and early April the United Kingdom found that none of the antibodies it purchased were good enough for use.
Hong Kong devised a scheme so that the expected patients could stay home, "an emergency department will give specimen tubes to patients," they spit in them, send them back, and get test results later. NHS England announced that NHS is pioneering a surprise case testing scheme at home so that it eliminates the risk of patients infecting other people if they come to the hospital or have to disinfect ambulances if used. On predictive testing of COVID-19 cases, a professional health professional will take samples using appropriate precautions.
On March 2nd, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurrection Physicians said that Germany had the capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in road care and 10,700 tests had been done the week before.
The costs are borne by health insurance if a doctor asks for tests.
According to president Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19th, Lantatur trials were offered in some major cities.
Per March 26, 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany is not known because only positive results are reported.
A laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples had been tested until and including the week 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion Hospital and Rambam developed and tested the methods to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and simply testing them if samples are found positive. In Wuhan, an emergency detector laboratory of 2,000 square feet (Haoo-Yan) ( Mandarin: yen, or "Fire Eye" in Indonesia) opened at February 520 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction being supervised by founder BGI Wang Jian and takes 5 days, modeling shows that the case in Hubei can be 47% higher and the cost of quarantine control could be doubled if this testing capacity does not exist.
The Wuhan lab was soon followed by Huo-Yan's lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
Per March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity of 50,000 tests per day. The multiplex design of open source released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1.222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 screens. This balanced design can be run in small laboratories without the need of robotic fluid control.
By March, insufficient shortages and amounts of reagents had been an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, Britain, and the United States.
Because of that, a number of researchers have attempted to explore sample setup protocols involving warming samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing.
This is accomplished through a combination of layman testing and the purchase of a population-scale lab of 42 Groups and BGI (based on the emergency detection lab "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, this lab was capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PRC tests a day and was the first laboratory to have this scale outside China.
Test recipes targeting various parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts German recipes for production of test tools sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop on its own.
German recipes were published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the U.S. Center for Disease Control were not available until January 28, which slowed down the testing available in the U.S. in the early days of the outbreak, China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test tools; these two countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient test tools to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
On the other hand, experts say that the wide availability of tests in South Korea helps reduce the spread of new coronaviruses.
Test capacity, mostly in private sector labs, was built within a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow down the increase in COVID-19 pandemics.
In March 2020, China reported an accuracy problem on their test tools.
In the United States, test tools developed by the CDC have "disfigured"; then the government removes bureaucratic barriers that prevent private testing.
The company explained that false results may have been a result of failure in collecting samples or using test tools correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said that they would pull out the equipment that gave the wrong results, and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic from China produce false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test tools from China that were not accurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that these test tools be thrown into the Danube River.
Tests, followed by positive quarantined people and tracking people who were in contact with positive SARS-CoV-2, gave positive results.
Researchers who worked in the Italian city of V practice, the first death site of COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing in an entire population of 3,400 people, about 10 days away.
About half of those tested positive have no symptoms, and all the cases found are quarantined.
With restrictions on travel to this community, new infections are eliminated altogether.
With aggressive contact tracking, restrictions on entry, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore develops much slower than any other developed countries despite extreme restrictions, such as forced closing restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore suggested that residents stay home on March 28, but schools reopened in time after their vacation on March 23rd.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics with aggressive contact tracking, restrictions on entry, testing, and quarantine, but with nonaggressive quarantines, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had far lower case fatalities, perhaps because these countries were more capable of detecting people who had mild symptoms or without symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without testing capacity, and national labs with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive samples of the first COVID-19 and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation.
Out of 16 reference labs, 7 is in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "%The test positive" is affected by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people who are hospitalized will have % positive results higher than a country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors.
Washing hands, which are also called hand sanitizers, is an act of cleaning someone’s hands that aims to eliminate unclean, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via a fecal-oral route.
People may also contract respiratory diseases, such as influenza or cold, if they do not wash their hands before they touch their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, the mucosa membrane).
The five critical seconds of the day that are crucial to washing hands with soap are: before and after defecating, after cleaning the child’s ass or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or preparing meat, fish, or raw birds.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be washed with ash.
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after treating the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning a kid who just used the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal dung.
Medical hand sanitization refers to the practice of cleanness associated with medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary purpose of washing hands is to rid the hands of pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in medicine, but it is also an important practice for the public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing influenza spread, corona virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the cause of infectious diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce infant mortality in home labor.
Studies conducted in 2013 show that increased handwashing practices can greatly increase child growth.
In developing countries, child mortality rates caused by respiratory and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple act can reduce the mortality rate of the disease to nearly 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhea to about a third; these interventions can be done by providing clean water in low - income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be associated with washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, as subconscious behaviors are done in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ISA, is the number one cause of child mortality; it causes deaths of some 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause deaths of nearly 3.5 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, making handwashes with soap before eating and after using toilets into an embedded habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical action, and reduce the deaths of diarrhea to half and death from acute respiratory infections to a quarter.
Washing hands is usually combined with other sanitation measures as part of the water, sanitation, and hygiene program.
Washing hands also protects itself from implatago transmitted through direct physical contact.
Small side effects washing hands are frequent handwashing that can cause skin damage caused by skin drying.
Studies conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that overwashing hands could cause an itch and scaly skin condition, known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, especially among health workers.
Washing hands is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
There are five critical seconds during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce disease transmission in a physical way: before and after using toilets, urinating, after cleaning child's buttocks, before feeding children, before eating and before preparing food or preparing meat, fish, or raw poultry.
Another important time to apply proper handwashing techniques to prevent disease infection is before and after treating wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing noses; after touching animal dung or dealing with animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the level of handwashing with soap is still low.
A study of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practice handwashing with soap. 2014 studies show that Saudi Arabia has the highest level by 97 percent; the United States is almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at the lowest level by 23 percent. Now there are some behavioral methodology of adopting hand washing habits with soap at a critical time. Washing hands group for students at the designated time is one of the choices in developing countries to make use of hand washing in child behavior.
The basic health care program applied to the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a proper scale of action to support the child’s health and education.
Giving worm drugs twice a year, coupled with washing your hands daily with soap and brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
The program has also been implemented in Indonesia.
The cleaning of skin microorganisms is reinforced by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soap and detergent is to reduce the barrier to solution and increase solute power.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleaner because fat and protein, which are components of organic waste, is not easily dissolved in water.
Nevertheless, the cleaning of fat and proteins is assisted by sufficient streams.
Solid soap, because of its reuseable nature, may contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies that study the transfer of bacteria from dense soap are contaminated conclude that evacuation is not possible because of foam - washed bacteria.
Even so, the CDC continues to declare that the liquid condensation that it releases from untouched containers is preferred.
Soap of anmarikeri was widely promoted to a health - conscious society.
To date, there has been no evidence that the use of antiseptic or disinfectant recommended is better for organisms that withstand antibiotics in nature.
The antibacterial soap, however, contains such common agents as tricklosans, which have a wide list of strains of resistant organisms.
So even if antibiotics - resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soap, they may not be as effective as marketed.
In addition to surveys and skin protections, advanced formulations can contain acidic acids (the acetate acids, ascorbat acids, lactic acids) as pH, benzoat acids as active antimicrobic acids, and advanced skin conditions (choviets, vitamins, mentols, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of the University of Oregon Health Facults shows that soap is as effective as antibacterial soaps that contain a trickle in preventing disease and cleaning bacteria from hand.
Warm, comfortable water for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm water is more effective than cold water is covered in dew in eliminating natural oils that withstand dung and bacteria.
However, contrary to the convictions of many, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Hand analytic or antiseptic hand is a water - based cleanness agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand sanitizers of water - based alcoholics (also known as alcohol - based hand polishers, antiseptic hand polishers, or hand sanitizers) became known.
Most of these janitors are based on alcohol or ethanol-based isopropils of alcohol or ethanol, which are formulated together with curing materials such as Carbomer (acrilate acid polymer) to gel or together with humektans such as glycerin into fluids or foam to be easy to use and to reduce the effects of drying from alcohol.
Addition of hydrogen peroxide encerer increases further antimicrobial activity. Hand-consistency of at least 60-95% of alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Sbathetic alcohol treatment kills bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), bacteria tuberculosis, a number of viruses (induce HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
The 70% alcohol-consistency of alcohol kills 99.97% (log reduction 3.5, similar to 35 decibel reductions) bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.99% (log reduction 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands of 1 minute after use.
Alcoholic hand-sensitation is almost entirely ineffective against the virus of norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of handtics or alcohol polishers must be used to wet or cover both hands completely.
The front and back of two hands and the tip of all fingers were rubbed about 30 seconds until liquid, foam, or dry gel.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that you wash your hands instead of rubbing your hands, especially when your hands are dirty.
The increased use of agents is due to the ease of use and quick murder activity of microorganisms; however, a licensed agent should not be used as a substitute for proper handwash, except soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based hand analysing can often cause dry skin, unless emolien and/or skin moisturizer are added to the formula.
The drying effect from alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and/or other emoticons to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol - based hand analysing that contains emolien causes irritation and drought of skin to be much lower than soap and antimicrobial detergent.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urtic syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol rubers are rare.
Lower inclinations cause disturbing contact dermatics to be the attraction of this product rather than washing their hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't clean hands of organic material, they just disinfect it.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens as pathogens remain at hand.
The efficacy of alcohol - free hand is high depending on its materials and formulation, and according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol abuse.
Recently, the formulation using benzalconium chloride has proved to have constant and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which has proven to be reduced after repeated use, may be due to a progressive side effect reaction.
Many people in low - income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash might increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, if contact with water, the ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The proper handwashing technique based on the recommendations of the U.S. Center for the prevention of infectious diseases includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold water that flows.
Water flowing is recommended because a quiet basin may be contaminated, while water temperature seems to have no effect.
Shake hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of the hand, between the fingers, and under the fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more closely when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub it for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer eliminates more germs.
Cleanly wash under the water flowing.
Wiped out in the basin could get the hands contaminated again.
Dry with a dry rag or let it dry in the air.
Wet, wet, wet hands are more likely to be contaminated, and often missed areas are thumbs, wrists, areas between fingers, and under fingernails.
Pulverized nails and nail polish can store microorganisms.
Combed lotion is often recommended to keep the hands dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection infection.
Low-cost options can be made for facilitating hand-washing while tap water and/or soap is not available, for example, draining water from jerry bars or bottles that are hung and vented and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (like schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions, such as "tiffy-tap", as well as other low-income options.
Tippy Keran is a simple technology that uses a water bottle that is hung by a rope, a lever operated by feet to pour a little water into the hand, and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the cleaning process, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hand drying in public toilets.
More research shows that paper wipes are much cleaner than the electric hand dryer found in many toilets.
In 2008 a study was conducted by Westminster University, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper wipes industry, comparing paper cleaning levels, warm air hand dryers, and a more modern jet air dryer.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria found increased by an average of 194% in knuckles and 254% in the palm of the hand.
Drying with jet air dryers causes a total increase of 42% bacteria in knuckles and 15% in the palm of the hand.
After washing and drying hands with paper wipes, the total amount of bacteria decreases 76% in the knuckles and 77% in the palm of the hand. Ilmuwan also does tests to determine the potential of cross contamination on other toilet users and toilet environments as a result of every type of drying method.
Jet airers, which blow air from units at a rate claimed to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), were able to blow microorganisms out of hands and units and potentially contaminate other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters.
The use of warm air - hand dryers spreads microorganisms up to .25 feet [0.25 m] from dryers.
The paper tap showed no significant spread of microorganisms.
After hand drying, changes in the number of bacteria following are observed:
There are many manufacturing hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper wipes.
Washing hands using hand - desalination tissue is an alternative during travel if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand analytics must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing was required long after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing illness in hospital environments.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the rate of infection decreased with the use of the device.
Medical handwashing was done for at least 15 seconds, using large amounts of soap and water or gel to wash and rub each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed against each other with fingers intertwined.
If there's dirt under the fingernails, the hairbrush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in water that is in hand, they need to wash thoroughly and dry with clean wipes.
After drying, paper wipes are used to turn off the tap (and open the exits if necessary).
This action avoids the decontamination of the hand from the surface.
The aim of washing hands in the health care order is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("courages") and avoid infection.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of washing hands is still at an unacceptable rate in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continue to forget to wash their hands before touching the patient and thereby infecting microorganisms.
One study shows that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can reduce blood flow infections related to catheter to 66 percent.
The WHO’s concept of hand hygiene can also be seen on his website for public comments.
The relevant review by Whitby et al.
A commercial device can measure and validate hand hygiene if a demonstration of obedience to rules is required.
The World Health Organization has five seconds to wash its hands:
After exposure to the blood.
before the aseptic task, and
Add antiseptic chemicals to soap.
The kill function may be wanted before performing surgery or in a situation where antibiotics-resistant organisms are very common. For 'spawning' hands before surgical surgery, it is necessary for taps that can be turned on and off without touching, chlorhexic or iodine washing, sterile wipes to dry the hands after washing, and sterile brushes to rub and other sterile instruments to clean under the fingernails.
All the jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and arms down to the elbows, usually 2.6 minutes.
Old emptying time (10 minutes) is not required.
When sanding, the water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
After washing your hands, hands are dried with sterile cloth and surgical robes worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or to use hand sanitizers before and after handling the sick.
For the control of Staphylocaus infection at the hospital, it was discovered that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands came from 20% of the first washing, and that additional benefits were obtained very little when hand sanitation was increased above 35%.
Using common soap causes more than three times as much infection to food than washing with antibacterial soap. The comparison between rubbing hands with alcohol-based solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap at 30 seconds each suggests that alcohol-based hand rubers reduce 26% more contamination than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol - based hand polishers to reduce influenza virus A H1N1 and the Clostridium divicile spores. Intervention to increase hand hygiene in the health care order can involve education for staff about hand washing, increases the availability of alcohol - based hand polishers, and written reminders and oral to staff.
More research is needed to learn about the most effective interventions in various health - care arrangements.
In developing countries, handwashing by soap is recognized as a basic cost - saving way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, a lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in the homes of residents, schools, and workplaces makes the target to reach universal handwashing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing taps near private toilets or public toilets are rarely available, although options are available for making cheap hand sanctums.
In any case, a low level of handwashing can also happen because of customs that have been planted and not because of lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and encouragement to wash hands with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and result in long - term population behavior changes.
To work effectively, surveillance and evaluation are necessary.
Systemistic review of 70 studies found that community-based approach to improving handwashing in LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example of handwashing in school is "Three Star Closeness" by UNICEF which encouraged school to take simple and cheap steps to make sure students wash their hands with soap, among other requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, the school can move from one star to the third star.
Building a washroom can be part of a hand - washing campaign that reduces child disease and death.
The World Washing Hand Day is another example of an increased awareness campaign that is trying to achieve the purpose of behavioral change because of the coronary virus 2019-2020, UNICEF encourages the use of handwashing emojis.
Some studies study the effectiveness of handwashing cost overall in developing countries in relation to the Diability-adjusted Life Year or the size of the year lost in pain.
One review suggests that encouraging handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than water intervention and other sanitation.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as a newborn mother or an injured soldier in the hospital, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneer hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "modern nursing" in England.
At that time, many still believe that infections are caused by a stench called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, epidemics transmitted through food and health care infections made the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important way to prevent infection spread.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 increased awareness in many countries would be essential to washing hands with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, posters of "right hand washing technique" were hung next to a hand washer in public toilets and in office - office toilets and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands of" means expressing a person's aversion to responsibility for something or engaging in something.
That expression came from the Bible chapter in Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it had become a broad expression used in the British community.
In Shakespeare’s work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands constantly to clean up imaginary stains; actions that showed her guilt for the crimes she committed and for persuading her husband to do so.
It has also been noted that, after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to appreciate the washing of their hands more.
Furthermore, a person who is allowed to wash his hands after such meditation has a smaller possibility of being involved in a compensation act that "cleans up", such as volunteering.
Religion ordered handwashing for the purpose of cleanliness and symbolically. The washing of symbolic hands, which used water, but without soap to wash hands, was part of the ritual of washing hands in many religions, including Bahá'í, Hindu belief, tevilah and netilem in Jewish, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. Religion also ordered handwashing for hygiene, especially after certain actions.
Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim religions require washing their hands after using the toilet.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims require washing their hands before and after meals.
Harm control at work for COVID-19
Workplace danger control for COVID-19 is application of safety methodology and work health for dangerous control to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper danger control at work depends on the location of work and the job, which is based on the risk assessment of exposure sources, the severity of diseases in society, and the risk factors of each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Work Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low - exposure risky jobs have minimal job contact with the public and other coworkers; for this job, are encouraged basic infection prevention measures, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay in the home if sick, respiratory ethics, and doing routine cleaning and disinfecting of the environment.
The risky work of exposure is involved in work that requires close contact or often with people unknown or suspected of COVID-19, but it may be infected by infection in an ongoing society or international journey.
These include workers who have contact with public societies such as in schools, work environments with high population density, and high volume retail settings.
Danger control for this group, besides basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high-intensity air filters, protection against sneeze, and providing protection when meeting with people with COVID-19.
OSHA considers the health and morgue exposed to people known or suspected of suffering from CAVID-19 high exposure risk, which increases to high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or take or handle specimens of, people known or suspected of suffering from COVID-19.
The appropriate danger control for this worker includes technical control, such as negative pressure vents, and self - protection devices that fit the job.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have some impact on the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to care for others, or fear of exposure.
The trade patterns can change, either in terms of the kind of things that are asked or how to obtain these things (such as shopping outside the rush hour, by delivery, or by landscape).
Finally, shipments of items from highly-sustained geographic areas of COVID-19 can be disrupted, alertness and plans for counterinfection can be used to guide protective measures.
Plans consider the level of risk associated with various jobs and jobs, including the source of exposure, the risk factors that arise from home and community order, as well as the risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
Plans also outline the necessary control to cope with these risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
The alertness and plan for infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of the outbreak relief involves reducing transmission among the staff, protecting those who risk higher for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the effects of other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where business is affects the countermeasures taken.
Danger control hierarchy is a framework that is widely used in security and work health to group dangerous control based on its effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 is inescapable, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative dialing, and lastly self-defense devices.
Technical control involves isolated employees from job related dangers without relying on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in policy or work procedures that require the actions of the workers or the giver.
Self - protection tools (APD) are considered to be less effective than technical and administrative control, but they can help prevent some exposure.
All APD types must be selected based on the dangers of the workers, properly installed as they are (for example, a respirator), worn consistently and properly, checked, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and removed, cleaned, and properly stored or removed to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Work Safety and Health Administration, low - exposure risky jobs have minimal job contact with the public and other coworkers.
The precautionary steps of basic infection recommended to all the workplaces include frequent handwashing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, respiratory ethics include covering cough and sneezing, providing tissue and garbage containers, preparing work from a long distance or a gradual turn of work, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and doing routine cleaning and disinfecting of the environment.
Quick identification and isolation of individuals who are potentially contagious is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory symptoms have to stay home until they are free of fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever - dehydration drugs or other symptoms, and that the leaver policy is flexible so that it allows employees to stay home to care for sick family members, and that employees know this policy.
According to OSHA, exposure risk jobs include jobs that require close contact or often within six feet (1.8 m) of unknown or suspected COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of infection in the community around the business location, or because someone has just traveled internationally to a location with extensive COVID-19 infection.
These groups include workers who have contact with public societies such as at school, work environments with high population density, and high - volume retail settings. Engineering control for this group and high - risk groups include installing high - risk air filters, increasing ventilation levels, installing physical barriers like plastic guards sneeze, and installing drive-thru or landscape windows for customer services. Administrative control for this group and high - risk groups include pushing sick workers to stay at home, changing face - to - face - to - face meetings with virtual communication, making shifts with the arrival/supcoming/regremental hours, stopping non-regular travel to locations that are experiencing COVID outbreaks, developing emergency communication plans, including the job concerns, complements and training on the current quality of COVIDs and behavioral armor, trainings that need to use clothing and protection tools on how to use them, providing for personal resources and environments, including private hands and washing, including customers, possibly putting access and warning on displays, or other methods, including exposures.
Workers in this risk group rarely require respirators.
If someone falls ill on an airplane, the proper control to protect the worker and other passengers involves separating the sick from the sick by six feet, appointing one cabin crew to take care of the sick, and offering facial masks to the sick person or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crews have to wear medical gloves once in a while treating sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and perhaps other self - protection devices if sick passengers experience fever, constant cough, or trouble breathing.
The mittens and other disposables must be removed in biohazard bags, and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.
Ideally, medical follow-up is done in isolated people's cabins, despite the spread in the community, for school and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures to clean or disinfect if an infected person is ever in the school building.
If there is infection in society at a minimum to medium level, social restrictions strategies can be applied, which include: cancel field visits, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or cafeteria meals, increase the distance between the table, gradual arrival and return, restricting nonessential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there's a high infection in the local community, besides social restrictions strategy, prolonging school closures may be considered, for law enforcement officers who perform daily routines, immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to make contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-preservation devices.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect belts and task supplies before being reused by sprays or household cleaners and follow standard operating procedures to control and remove secondhands as well as to control and wash dirty clothes.
OCHA considers certain health and morgues to be high - exposure or very high - risk categories.
High - exposure risky work involves giving health care, support, labs, and medical transportation personnel exposed to known or suspected patients of COVID-19.
This job becomes a very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol - producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, patients known or suspected COVID-19.
Aerosol - producing procedures include intubation, induction procedures of cough, bronchoscopes, some procedures and dental examinations, or invasive specimens.
The work of high - exposure morgues includes workers involved in preparing the bodies of known or suspected COVID-19 cases at the time of death; this job becomes a very high risk of exposure if workers perform autopsies. Additional engineering for risk groups includes isolation for known or suspected patients of COVID-19, including when aerosol - producing procedures are performed.
Special negative pressure vents may fit in some of the health care arrangements and morgues.
Specimen must be dealt with by the security precautions of the Levels of Biology 3.
The World Health Organization recommends that patients who arrive be separated into different waiting rooms based on their alleged case of COVID-19. In addition to other APD, OSHA recommends respirators for people who work within 6 feet of a known or suspected patient who are infected by SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 filter cover respirators approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of written and comprehensive respiratory protection programs that include compatibility tests, training, and medical examinations.
Another type of respirator can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend fully covered clothes or coveralls because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and not transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for screening officers at point of entry.
For those who take specimens of breathing, care for, or transport patients of COVID-19 without procedures producing aerosol, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial shield, robes, and gloves.
If the aerosol - producing procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the supply of APD is not sufficient worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing the needs of APD through long-range medical services, physical restrictions such as transparent windows, with only those involved in immediate care may enter the room containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APD required for certain tasks, continue to use the same respirators without releasing them while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks to people without symptoms.

LIST: CC0: No protected privileges
We find ourselves in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is what makes global human connection and the responsibilities we have for each other.
We've never faced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and development of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern we've seen among all our colleagues through email, calls, and chats is an extraordinary validation of extraordinary human beings, which we're fortunate enough to work with them.
My gratitude and pride in infinity can call you all co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how much it means for the world right now to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful it is for this vital resource to remain available online for everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you keep this site running, help pay our partners, or help keep our community safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, especially now.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're going to make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team meets last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right response to the challenges we faced and the best way to maintain organizational survival during this time.
We'd very much like to remove the pressure and support our mission for the long run.
If you need to reduce the work schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work prospects are about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set holidays, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission requires you.
However, the world is unpredictable at this time, and whether you need to care for loved ones, shop for basic needs, or go to a doctor, your well - being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It's not supposed to be said, but we say it.
Pain or PTO leave is not required, just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to make sure the main jobs are resolved.
(If you are diagnosed positively with COVID-19, please tell Bryan in T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and make sure your situation gets the proper attention of management).
Friends whose hour-based wages will be paid in full.
We've said it, and say it once again, in honor of our commitment to contractor partners and clock-based staff.
Everyone will be paid according to their regular working hours when things are normal.
This includes if you get sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way of channeling stress on the world around us.
The work we do can be very rewarding, especially in times like these.
Again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There are some jobs that have to keep going.
SRE, SDM operations, Trust & Security teams, and fund development teams, among other things, do important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all departments to assess the current objective and divert our focus to support the essentials for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus fully on the most essential project.
Slowing down this moment will be nothing for the future.
We're not planning on working late after this pandemic.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet an unrealistic deadline at this time.
We realized that the situation was changing and would try to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about APP?
To adjust to new realities and the expectations of daily hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the execution of the Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our point is to propose an extension of plans 2019-2020 that allow more time to make budgets so that employees can give priority to important jobs, self - care, and care of loved ones while accommodate those who need to or want to work with fewer schedules for the next few weeks.
The length of this timeline greatly reduces workload and current planning pressures throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will update the delegates and the team in the next step as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Status, displays, and office cleanups
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great concern, we hired an antivirus cleanup crew to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-class antivirus fluids to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all the elevators that access our floor.
The building implements its own safety protocols using a product that supports the safety of its tenants.
We're happy that the office will be ready to use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, who has distributed COVID-19 protocols to us and all staff members based in DC.
From last week, our D.C. office has moved to a full long-distance job order, in line with the guidelines shared by San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues based in NYC know, we're also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion still continues, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues worked remotely for the first time.
Our long - distance companion realizes that it may require adjustments and they want to give you advice:
Limit the duration of the meeting at most an hour or two.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into a few days.
Define the meeting, establish an agenda, and send in the previous reading material.
Make videos the default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Show a leader to facilitate every meeting, someone to monitor the chatter for questions and record the speakers list, and someone to help make a close note (or perform collaborative notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy small food.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about the work being shared
The SDM operations team is looking for webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support the increased work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This past week we've asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declared the pandemic was over.
We told them that we understood our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to complete approved grant activities and that there would be no penalty for delaying or modifying the target.
This next week we'll follow up with additional guidelines on Wikimania and regional community conferences and other themes.
In general, the sentiments of the entire global community seem to be the grief caused by this disorder, but at the same time relief from the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Forward, CRT is trying to set up a page at Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation.
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, 2:00 UTC/07 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take the time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information from this email and all the essential information related to the other COVID-19 at Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and ensure that all information is in one place.
We're also trying to maintain regular communication with staff members currently living in countries that are significantly impacted.
If you have questions about travel, events, major workflow, or difficulties about coverage, or anything else that might require assistance, feel free to share and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and be the liaison as needed.
If you have secret or sensitive issues, please send an email to Bryan Judan, director of International Global SDM Operations.
Never should any of these changes be seen as neglecting our work and obligation.
On the other hand, this change is a confession that, today, our work and obligation may need to be adapted in ways we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support that our movement requires, and give the world the services they depend on.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create room for important work that will come in the next few weeks and perhaps months.
We need all of you to do that, and for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can do your best when you need it.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'enzim converter angiotensine 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cell in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has a counter-intuitive enzyme with angiotension enzyme, by reducing the number of angiotensants and increasing Angiotension (1-7), thus making it a promising drug target to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as a point of entry into the cell for some coronavirus.
The ACE2 version of man is often referred to as hace2.
The angiotensian enzyme is a zinc - containing metaloenzim located on the surface of endothel cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has the domain M2 peptide terminal-N and the amino acid transporter domain renal collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single-type I-pass membrane protein, with an enzymeically active domain exposed to cell surfaces in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracellular domain is separated from the transmembran domain by another enzyme, known as the sheddase, and the resulting solute protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excused into the urine.
ACE2 is in most organs: ACE2 attaches to the cell membrane especially pulmonary cell type II, small bowel enterocytes, endothelic cells arteries and veins, and smooth muscle cells arteries in most organs.
The expression mRNA ACE2 is also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stems.
ACE2's main function is to balance ACE.
ACE splits angiotensine I into angiotension II vasoconstrication.
Finally, ACE2 cut amino acid fenilalanin terminal carboksil from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Phe) and hydrolysed it into angiotensin (1-7) vassodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, applein, neurotension, dinofin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the traffic of the amino acid transporter membrane neutral SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup’s disease.
As a transmembran protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the S1 protein bindings on the spikes or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 bumps with the ACE2 enzymeic domain on the cell surface cause endocytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosomes in the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires priming S protein by the inside series of TMPRSS2, which is currently being investigated as a potential therapy.
However, many professional societies and regulation agencies recommend continuing the standard ACE inhibitor therapy and ARB.
A systematic and metaanalysis review, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of the ACE inhibitors caused a significant 34% decline in the risk of pneumonia compared with control."
Further, "The use of the ACE inhibitor also lowers the risk of pneumonia on patients who have higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of the ACE inhibitors is also associated with a drop in pneumonia-related mortity, although the result is less powerful than the risk of total pneumonia."
ACE2 recombinant human beings are expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injuries, and it seems to increase lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute breathing syndrome caused by acute lipoplicacide.
The rhACE2 halftime in humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute job note other than the 24-hour period of effect.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance of renin-angiotensant systems (the RAS) classic inhibitors or in angiotension II disease in increased blood circulation.
b'Application COVID-19 is a cellular software application designed to help track the contact to cope with the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, which is a process of identifying people who may have made contact with the infected.
Many applications were developed or proposed, having official government support in some areas and jurisdictions.
Some frameworks to build contacts tracking applications have been developed.
The privacy problem is questioned, especially related to a system based on tracking the geographic location of the application user.
Alternatives that do not invade privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s closeness to another cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionality to support those Bluetooth-based applications directly into the Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has spread applications that allow citizens to check if they have contact with people with COVID-19.
This app was used in over 200 cities of China, in Singapore, an app called TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. The North Macedonian launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application for tracking exposure to potentially infected individuals and providing immediate response to health care authorities.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and Ministry of Health.
Until April 14, 2020, the application was still waiting for the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government stated that the contact tracking application is in an advanced development phase and will be available for distribution within a few weeks. similar applications are planned in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether and BlueTrace protocols. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications to diagnosed patients COVID-19 who live in Moscow; these applications are designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security techniques at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur in application-based systems, which include false positives and possible lack of effectiveness if the data taken is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
To overcome concern about the spreading of misleading or dangerous “cooronavirus” applications, Apple set limits on the type of organization that can add coronavirus related applications to App Store, which is restricting only to the "regular" or the one with a good reputation.
Google and Amazon implement similar restrictions.
Advocates of privacy voice their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially of whether surveillance infrastructure created to handle the coronavirus pandemic will be halted after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issue statements calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
This organization states eight conditions on a government project:
Surveillance must be "by law, necessary, and proportion,"
expansion of monitoring and surveillance must have sunset clauses;
use of data must be restricted to COVID-19 destination;
The security and anonymity of the data must be protected and proved protected by evidence;
Digital surveillance must avoid ever more discrimination and marginalization;
each data sharing with a third party must be defined in laws;
There must be protection against abuse and rights of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation means that all my interests are relevant, which include public health experts and the amaginalized groups, and German chaos Computer Club and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) also issue a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intended to address the ongoing surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the operating system of the device after it was no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, and not an application, which removes the obligation to download applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with the central server need to access personal location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and using central servers only for intercommunication (see the lower part).
In South Korea, app-based systems are used to track contacts.
In exchange for using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including cellular device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to produce a text message to a potential infected person.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government has also made information available to the public, which is allowed with extensive changes in information privacy laws after the country's spread of MERS.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries like Germany consider using both centralized systems and systems that protect privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, the details had not been released.
A contact tracking that protects privacy is an established concept, with a large amount of literature research starting from at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts worked on a friendly privacy solution, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the closeness of users with other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains a neutralized and decentralized approach, and it is not a single protocol. A decentralized protocol includes closeness tracking that protects decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), a Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called the Contact Event Number, CEN), Privacy Protocol and Mechanism for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), and so on.
In this protocol, identified personal data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
Privacy Group at MlT Media Lab developed SafePaths, platforms to use techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location or strip intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It's based on a study of the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar update was the SaveTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that developed privacy technology and was originally also founded at MIT Media Lab.
Safely used hardware technology to enable users to share locations and health data sensitive to other users and officers without compromising the privacy of the data.
On April 5, 2020, the global coalition of TCN was founded by groups who had the same approach essentially and was a huge overlap protocol, with the goal of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability to program tracking and warnings, which is a major aspect of reaching extensive acceptance.

According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to launch in three stages:
The launch device to allow the government to create official applications tracking the coronavirus which protects privacy.
The integration of these functions directly into iOS and and Android Google and Apple plans to deal with the problem of constantly taking data and surveillance by initially distributing the system through the renewal of the operating system, then removing it the same way after the threat has passed.
b'Reposition of a drug (also called a new destination, a new profile, or a new assignment to drugs or therapy transitions) is an approved drug use for the purpose of a new treatment, namely, for disease or medical conditions that differ from the original purpose of drug development.
It is a path of scientific research that is currently being carried out to develop a safe and effective treatment of COVID-19.
Another course of research includes the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and a convalescent plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be targeted for drugs, each protein has several liline binding sites.
Analysis of these lilen binding sites can be the basis for an effective antivirus drug development project against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of SARS-CoV-2's most important proteins are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase RNA, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatease.

Besides, trials are also done in Italy and China, see also Tocizumab#COVID-19.
B'Vaccine COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there's a lot of effort being made to develop the vaccine.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of this disease, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 identified on December 2019.
The great epidemic spread across the world in 2020, resulting in enormous investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use the genome published to develop vaccines that might be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI Initiative made a statement in April that the thing to be concerned about developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, distribution on the scale needed, and global access.
In April, the Lmuwan CEPI reported that 10 different technological platforms were in early 2020 research and development to create effective vaccines against COVID-19.
Target the main platform that advances to Phase I security study, covering:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) ( Phase I beetles and vaccine candidates: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vectors (Fase I beetles and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenovirus vectors)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others were announced, but with very little public information available (approximately being in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II's trials conducted initial security and immunity tests, usually done at random, controlled placebo, and in some locations, while determining more effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including control groups, and testing vaccine effectiveness to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of 79 active vaccine candidates developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of which are not yet in human evaluations (still in the study of praclinis).
On January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating the potential molecular pinning vaccine which would genetically modify the viral protein to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at Saskatchewan University announced that they began developing vaccines, with targets for human testing in 2021.

They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested in humans "in 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army and Medical Research Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were working with Novavax Inc.
in the development and development of vaccines.
Furthermore, this partnership announced a preclinical test plan and the clinical trial of Phase I in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolats, and even on the fast track, vaccine development took at least one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronaviruslike particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is in laboratory research, with human testing planned in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered "'a large sum of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, who was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, Pfizer's American pharmaceutical company announced partnership with German companies, BioNTech, to together develop mRNA-based vaccines.
Currently, mRNA-based vaccine candidates, BNT162, are in the preclinical testing of clinical trials estimated to begin in April 2020.
On March 17th 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech companies Takis Biotech announced that they would get the results of the preclinical testing in April 2020 and vaccine candidates at the final stage can begin testing in humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Coalition Innovation of Epidemics (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Thems Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with total CEPI investments in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine reached US$29 million.
Another partnership of CEPI investments for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queenland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates in animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine that could self-applicate COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate developed in 14 days after receiving a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced a fund of C$275 million for 96 medical research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and Saskatchewan University.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced a fund of C$192 million specifically to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national vaccine bank containing some new vaccine that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurred.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh University Medical School reported the test of PittCoVacc, the candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine, in mice; they stated that "MNA who gave S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine created a specific antigen antigen antigen response [in mice] that began to appear two weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the Waterloo University Pharmaceutical Faculty announced the design of DNA-based vaccine candidates as potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriaofag, DNA is designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless, viral-like particles, which can stimulate immune systems to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, governments, industries, and three U.S. universities collected resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologists, which are also called nonspecific effects.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Further random tests in Australia attempted to include 4,170 health workers.
There's a chance the vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research on the efficacy of vaccines used specific COVID-19 models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other lab animals, and non-human primates, showed the need for containment measures to achieve biological safety level 3 in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested on non-human animal models.
Up to 2020, there was no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that proved to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, vaccine identification and development and new drugs to treat SARS are a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS became a prevalent, SARS research was believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy for MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there was a MERS vaccine that completed clinical trials of I phase in humans, and three other vaccines were in the process, which were all viral vectors, two adnovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MOV vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media broadcasts suggest conspiracy theories that claim the virus behind the COVID-19 have been known before and that vaccines have been available.
Patents quoted by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus vessels, such as SARS coronavirus.
b' Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and asphyxiation.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
Time from exposure to symptoms is generally about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases produce mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and congestion failures.
Until April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territory, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured. the virus is especially spread among humans when close contact occurs, often through sparks or small droplets produced through coughing, sneezing, or while talking.
Although generated when exhaling, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious to long distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last for 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious for the first three days after symptoms, although the spread may occur before symptoms appear and after the next stage of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is with the reaction of the real-time transcription chain on the memorization of nasofaring.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of contracting the virus and those who treat it.
Recommendations regarding the use of masks by common societies vary; some authorities recommend not using masks, some recommend their use, and others require its use.
At present, there is no vaccine or antivirus treatment specific to COVID-19.
Local transmissions of disease have been recorded in almost every country in the six WHO areas.
People infected with the virus may be either without symptoms or experience symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and asphyxiation.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or congestion in the chest which is constantly, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blue faces or lips; medical support is immediately advised if these symptoms appear.
Respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, snot, or throat pain can be found, but they are rarer.
Gastrointive symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China begin with a clinical view of chest congestion and palpitation.
In some people disease can develop into pneumonia, compound organ failure, and death.
It's called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of the people who have gone into shock will experience symptoms in 11.5 days of infection, reports indicate that not everyone infected has symptoms.
The role of this without symptoms in infection is not yet fully known; however, early evidence indicates that they may contribute to the spread of disease.
Currently, the proportions of infected people who show no symptoms are unknown and are being studied, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all cases are confirmed without symptoms during hospitalization.
China’s National Health Commission began to include no symptoms in her daily case on April 1, of 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) show no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a virus load on a large scale.
Talking loudly releases more sparks or droplets than speak normally.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can cause droplets to be pushed up to four feet [1.5 m] (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States suggests that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air collectors placed in the hallways outside the room people produce positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and lung heart resuscitation (RJP), can make a small breather turn into an aerosol and then spread through the air.
While there is concern that viruses can spread through fesses, these risks are believed to be low, the most contagious viruses when people are exposed; although the spread may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control says that although it's not entirely clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person generally infects two to three others, the virus can survive on the surface for hours to days.
In particular, it was discovered that viruses can be detected for a day on carton/cardus, up to three days in plastic (polipropilen) and rust - resistant steel (304A) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
Yet, it varies depending on moisture and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective when used properly; soap products break down a layer of viral protective fat, deactivating the virus, and releasing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Another solution, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexdin glulonat, is less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples are taken in the median two days after the intake is started.
In five out of six patients, the first sample shows the highest virus charge, and the sixth patient shows the highest virus charge on test day two.
Coronavirus 2 heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to acute respiratory cases in Wuhan.
All the properties of SARS-CoV-2 virus are new to the familiar coronavirus in nature.
Outside the human body, this virus was killed by domestic soap, which damaged its protective bubble.
Lungs are the most impacted organs by COVID-19 because viruses access host cells through angiotension 2 enzyme (ACE2), the most abundant in alveolar cell type II lungs.
This virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spike or bulge" to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acoust heart injuries were found at 12% of infected people who were treated in Wuhan, China, and more frequently in severe diseases.
High cardiovascular levels due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorder during disease development, but acute myocard injuries may also be related to the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed very high in the heart and involved in heart function.
High trombosis incidents (31%) and venereal trombolism (25%) were found in patients with COVID-19 infections in the ICU and may be related to poor prognosis. Opopsy in people who died of COVID-19 found the damage to alveolar difus (DAD) and infilt inflammatory inflammatory in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropicism for epitel cells of breathing channels that express ACE2, heavy COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, the T cells that secrete pathogenic GM-CSF have proven to be correlated with monocyclist recruitment that involves IL-6 inflammatory and severe lung pathology in patients COVID-19.
The lymphotic Infiltrate has also been reported on the autopsy.
WHO has published some testing protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is a polymerase chain reaction of real-time transcriptions.
This testing is usually done in respiratory samples obtained through memorizing nasofaring; however, samples of nasal or spoutum can also be used.
Generally, results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but it requires two blood samples taken within two weeks so that the results have a small amount of time.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequences so that labs around the world can develop self-inflicted polymerase chain reactions to detect infections by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, an antibody test (which can detect active infections and if one has been infected before) is under development, but it hasn't been used much.
China’s experience with such tests shows that it is only 60 to 70% accurate.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnosis guidelines released by Zhongnan University of Wuhan suggest a method of detecting infections based on clinical images and risk of epidemics.
The ground-glass opacity multilobar bilateral with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and posterior are found largely at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving, and consolidation can occur as disease develops.
A little data is available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 patophysiology.
The major pathological findings on the autopsy are:
Copy macros: Pleurition, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four strains of pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia pneumocytes, large athic pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphotic inflammation, and the formation of large, multi-stardly giant cells
Heavy pneumonia: dipinus alveolar damage (DAD) with exudat alveolar diffuse.
DAD is the cause of acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) and heavy hypochemia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: exhumation sequences in alveolar cavity and interstitial fibrosis pulmonary
Blood: intraccular coagulation disamined (DIC); leukoeriblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, noses, or mouths with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing and recommending the use of the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of fabric covers in public places, in part to limit the transmission of people without symptoms, social restrictions strategy is intended to reduce contact with people who are infected with many, by shutting down schools and workplaces, by limiting travel, and by canceling large-scale meetings in public places.
Bounding guidelines also include people who maintain a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 feet [1.8 m].
No known drug has been effective in preventing COVID-19. Because the anticipated vaccine hasn't existed until early 2021, the main part of handling COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "Flattening curves".
CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after toilets or when hands look dirty, before eating, and after breaking their noses, coughing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand analysing that contains at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand-anitation is unavailable, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it's not "active substances for hand antiception".
Glycerol added as humane.
People are treated with support care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other exposed vital organs.
The CDC recommends people who think they're carrying a virus to wear simple facial masks.
The oxygenation of the extraporeum membrane (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failures, but the benefits are still being considered.
Self - cleanness and lifestyle and wholesome diet are recommended to enhance immunity.
The supportive treatment of people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection, WHO and the China National Health Commission have published recommendations to deal with people who have COVID-19 who have been treated.
Intensive care experts and lung experts in the U.S. have compiled recommendations from various agencies to free resources, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend parasetamol (aasetaminefen) more than ibuprofen for the use of the first line.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of viral infection, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosol, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
The CDC recommends placing the person in the Tular-Urah Infection Room (AIIR) other than using standard precautions, contact prevention, and ventilation measures.
Recommended tools are: APD robes, facial masks, eye armor, and medical mittens.
The N95 respirator is approved for industrial order, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used based on Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The N95 respirator is designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for unlabeled use.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial armor or, as a final effort, a homemade mask.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so heavy that they require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but some cases are heavy.
The type of respiratory support for people who have lost their breath regarding COVID-19 is being actively studied for those who are treated, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high - flow nasal canulas or bipositive air duct pressure.
It is not yet known whether one of these methods brings the same benefit to the critically ill.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical vents, if available, because they limit the spread of aerosol particles rather than high - flow canals.
Many developed countries don't have adequately per capita hospital beds, which limit the health system's capacity to handle sudden surges of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require intake.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people with COVID-19 who were treated ended up in the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute breathing syndrome occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators capable of performing high pressure control mode and PEEP are required to maximize oxygen delivery as well as minimize the risk of lung injury and ventilator related pneumotoraks.
High PEEPs may not be available on old ventilators.
The study of treatment potential began in January 2020 and some antivirus drugs were under clinical trial.
Remdesivir seems the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may take up to 2021, some of the drugs being tested have been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antivirus drugs can be tried on people with severe diseases.
The volunteers recommended by WHO participated in the test of effectiveness and security of potential treatment. the FDA has provided temporary authorization for confence plasma as experimental treatment in the case of a person's very life or immediately threatened.
Plasma convergence has yet to undergo the clinical studies necessary to prove its safety and effectiveness to this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a cellular application to deal with the epidemic.
Users are requested to enter their name and ID number.
This application is able to detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so it can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of another three users.
If risk potential is detected, applications not only recommend self-religion but also inform local health officials, allotmental analysis of cell phone data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track down infected people and people who are in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, Israel’s government allowed security agencies to track the phone records of people suspected of contracting coronavirus.
That step was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who might be in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telecom distributed the aggregate data of the phone location to the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
The Russians used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was told cell phone operators that "40% of the citizens are still moving around".
The German government did a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Moreover, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid made a global cry for a creative solution against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection themselves.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor who says, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic decline is a perfect storm of mental health and public well-being."
The disease can take on light with little or no symptoms, which resemble other common airway diseases, such as colds.
A mild case usually heals in two weeks, while those who suffer from severe or critical illness may require three to six weeks to recover.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but the data for COVID-19 is minimal.
In the worst - hit people, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into acute respiratory syndrome that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or compound organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and liver damage.
A blood clotting disorder, particularly the increase in prothrombin time, is observed at 6% of the COVID-19 patients who are treated intake, while kidney function disorders are seen at 4% of the group.
About 20-30% of people with a picture of COVID-19 show an increase in liver enzymes.
According to the same report, the median time between symptoms awitan and death is ten days, with five days spent in the inn treatment.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have a median seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study that examined early cases, median time from early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a span of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) China, men have a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women have a death rate of 1.7%.
Hystopatological examination of postmortem lung samples indicates that alveolar damage was diffused with cellular fibromics exudats in both lungs.
The virus's cytopmatic changes are observed in the pneumosite.
Lung images resemble acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8% of deaths reported by the China National Health Commission, heart damage is observed, with increased levels of troponin or heart stops.
According to March's data from the United States, 89% of those treated have built-in conditions.
Estimated mortity of the condition varies because of differences in the region, but also because of methodological difficulties.
Lack of light counting can cause death to be calculated too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of past cases can mean that today’s morals are being counted too low.
The smokers have 1.4 times greater symptoms of severe COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or death than non-smokers, and there are concerns about the long-term sequela disease.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop in lung capacity 20% to 30% on some recovering from disease, and lung scans indicate organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive syndrome after recovery.
By March 2020, infections were not yet known to provide effective and long - term immunity to those who were cured of the disease.
Immunity is viewed as possible, if you look at other coronavirus behaviors, but there have been reports of a case of COVID-19 recovery followed by a positive coronavirus test a few days later.
This case is believed to be a festering infection, and it's not a re-infection.
This virus is suspected of natural origin and originating from animals, through spreading infections.
The origin is unknown, but over December 2019, the spread of infection is almost entirely driven by transmission from human to human.
A study of 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 at The Lancet, revealed the earliest symptoms date was December 1, 2019.
Officials from WHO reported the earliest symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortity.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, management options, times since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO set the ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for the deaths of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed labs and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths diagnosed clinically or epidemiologically without confirmation of laboratory infections for SARS-CoV-2. The ratio of deaths to cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases in a specified interval.
According to the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the ratio of deaths to cases globally is 6.9% (153.822/2,240,191) per April 17, 2020.
The number vary according to the region. Another measurement covers the fatality rate of the case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of the diagnosed person who died of a certain disease, and the fatality rate of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of the infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not everyone infected makes antibodies, antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In the episentrum of the plague in Italy, Castiglite d'Adda, a small village of 4600 residents, 80 (1,7%) died.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through the Carnival festival, which spread among young people, causing relatively inferior mortity, and the possibility that not all of COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, the German health system is not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as researched from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) are contributed to death due to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemics and their mortality rates is different for men and women.
Morality is higher on men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for a man is in his 50s, with a difference of risk between a new man and a woman not visible at the age of 90.
In China, the death toll is 2.8 percent for men and for women by 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for differences based on this sex is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have corroborative conditions, such as hypertension, at younger ages than women can contribute to higher morality to men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected are men and 72% of the people who died of COVID-19 are men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not trace sex related data to the COVID-19 infection.
Studies indicate that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
The percentage of women’s sexes are higher, especially the nurses, and they have a higher chance of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease was "COVID-19".
The leader of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebrenesus explains that CO stands for corona, VI for the virus, D for the disease, and 19 for when the plague was first identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to certain geographic locations (e.g. China), animal species, or a group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming in order to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is named coronavirus, which causes acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses the COVID-19 virus and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan Koronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases according to 2015 guidelines that urge not to use location names in the name of disease and virus.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 issued on February 11, 2020.
Because of the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital producers print health - care materials such as carp and ventilator components.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital desperately needs ventilator valves, and suppliers cannot provide on the time needed scale, a local company reverse-engineered and printed 100 needed valves overnight.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation arose regarding origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of disease, which spread rapidly online.
Humans seem capable of spreading the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There's no drug or vaccine approved to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated "SOLIDARY Trial" to examine the effects of treatment of four existing antivirus compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines are not available yet, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV was used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccinations strategies being studied.
First, researchers aim to make a whole virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, whether it is inactive or dead, is intended to trigger quickly the human immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, is intended to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits in viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, it focused on the S-spike protein that helped the virus infiltrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine.
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies had to be tested to know the safety and efficacy.
Vaccines contain harmless genetic codes copied from viruses that cause disease.
There were over 300 active clinical trials going on in April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated treatments that have been approved for malaria, including four studies on hydrocyclopocycin or chloroquine.
A new purposed antivirus drug formed most of China’s research, with nine phase III tests on rhesisivir in some countries with a deadline to report in late April.
By April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidates and medicine COVID-19 was in existence. Some antivirus drugs were being evaluated for COVID-19 treatments, including rhodisivir, chlorocuin and hydrocycloroquinine, lopinavir/ritzvir, and lopinavir/rivir combined with beta interferon.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for the efficacy of remesivir.
Clinical increase is observed in patients treated with rheumatism in emergency medicine.
The clinical trials of Phase III are being conducted in the U.S., China, and Italy, which previously used to treat malaria, studied in China in February 2020, with early results.
However, there was a call to report on the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chlorokuin.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending daily doses of one gram, records that double doses are dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued the emergency use of hydrocyclycroquinine and chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19. China's 7th edition also included interferons, laptops, or umifenovirts for use against COVID-19.
Early data suggests that high doses of laptoprin were required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further study in vivo after showing SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in low concentration. Research shows that early priming of protegration proteins by the transmbrance series 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential to the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The study of chloroquines and hydrocyclocroquins with or without anatrophysicins has huge limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. The Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of the cytokines can occur in the COVID-19 weight of advanced levels.
There's evidence that the hydrocyclocroquin may have antisytokin properties.
This drug is going through phase two on the national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with severe illness.
Combined with the serum's ferintine blood test to identify the cytokines, the drug was intended to fight the cytokine, which is suspected to be the cause of death in some of the people who fell.
In 2017, antagonist interleukin-6 receptor was approved by the FDA based on the study of retrospective cases for treatment of cytokin retractors of steroids introduced by a different cause, namely, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no random, controlled evidence that suggests that tocizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring refined and treated antibodies produced by the healing system of COVID-19 to those who need it are being studied as passive nonvaccine immunization methods.
This strategy was attempted for SARS with an inconsequential outcome.
The viral neutralization is a work mechanism expected for passive antibody therapy can megadify the defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity depending on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, use the production of monoclonal antibodies, in development.
The production of convalessen serum, which is part of the fluid of the patient’s cured blood and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of closely related syndrome
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after exposing awareness of the spread of the virus.
