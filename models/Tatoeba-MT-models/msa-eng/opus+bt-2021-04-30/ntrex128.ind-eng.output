Members of the Welsh Assembly (AM) are concerned when they ‘look like muppets'.
There were concerns among some AMs against a suggestion that their designation should have been changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/ Welsh Members of Parliament).
This arose due to a plan to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
AMs across the political spectrum are concerned if it can invite ridicule.
An AM labour party said that his group was concerned, "The designation was in tune with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means shit.
An assembly member (AM) said that his group as a union, felt "distasteful" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open-minded" to the name change, but judged that this was a pun from the MWP abbreviation to Muppet.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission currently drafts a law to introduce the name change, saying: "The final decision on any explanation of the designation for AMs is certainly a matter for the members themselves."
The 2017 Wales Government's decision empowered the Wales Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation over a proposal known to gain wide support to refer to the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the designation of the AMs, the Commission preferred WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/ Welsh Members of Parliament), but the MWP option gained the most support on public consultation.
The AMs apparently put forward an alternative option, but the struggle to reach the consensus could upset the chairman, Elin Jones who was expected to submit the design of the change laws within weeks.
These reform laws will include other changes to how the assembly works, including disqualification rules for AMs and committee system design.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the law.
The Macedonian public went to vote on the referendum regarding the changing of the country's name
The vote owners will determine the choice of whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia Republic."
The famous vote was held in an effort to settle a decade - long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also had a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighboring country shows a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected offers of European Union and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, a voter for the name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was a price to be paid for joining the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bells didn't ring when the Churches in Harlem were having trouble
"Historically, the old people I talked to said there used to be a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adam
"Today, there is none."
He said that the disappearance of all the bars was understandable.
"People socialize in other ways" these days, he said.
"The bar is no longer the living room of the surrounding community where people visit it regularly."
As well as the church, she was concerned that the money proceeds from the sale of assets would not last as the leaders had hoped, "and sooner or later they would return again from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could have been replaced with apartment buildings with condominiums filled with people who would not help keep the remaining sanctuaries around them.
"The majority of the people who are going to buy condominiums in these buildings are white people," he said, "and will therefore speed up the day that these churches close simultaneously because there is no way that people moving into those condominiums will be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black city of the metropolis - Metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
The black congregation that had worshipped in the vicinity had taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation under Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of retail merchants on 125th street, the main road to shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
The fire in 1939 caused the building to be heavily damaged, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild, they built the tower bell.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at St. Martin proudly referred to the tower's bell as "the bell of the poor"
An expert who rang the tower bell in July gave it another designation: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the world's first tower bell played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind who switched to ringing the bell of the larger tower at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in Saint Martin the past few months is an elaborate architectural and contractor tale, some carried by lay church leaders, and others carried by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the governing body of the diocese, formed of lay leaders - wrote a letter to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "would attempt to charge" on the vestry party, although vestry was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of the lack of transparency from the diocese.
Sharks injured 13-year-olds in lobster diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch lobsters in California in the opening event of the lobster season, one officer said.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that she had been diving with her friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when she heard a boy asking for help and then rowing in groups to help pull her out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a burst of excitement after catching lobster, but then he "realized" that the boy was shouting: ‘I was bitten!
I was bitten!'
His entire collarbone was torn apart," Hammel said that he realized it when he had reached for the child.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The child was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where she was handled in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack is unknown.
Coast Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area one week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed access to the coast from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles realized that there were over 135 species of sharks in this region, but most of them were considered harmless.
The Sainsbury Plan broke down the British beauty market
Sainsbury took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with convenience store-style beauty stalls run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial push on the British beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of fashion products and household appliances decline, larger beauty kiosks will be tested on 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if that proves successful.
Investment in beauty became a hunting event for supermarkets to utilize shelves that used to be TV, microwave, and home appliances.
Sainsbury said that it would double the size of beauty offerings to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie,Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current series of brands starting from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas as found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its series of boutique makeup so that most of its products would be friendly to vegans - something young shoppers are increasingly interested in.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury stores, the first which opened in Croydon. south London last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, late this year.
Online shopping and the switching of daily food needs in small quantities in local grocery stores meant that supermarkets had to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury, has said that stalls will increasingly look like Malls when supermarket chains attempt to counter pressurers such as Aldi and Lidl by providing more and no-food services.
Sainsbury has put Argos stalls in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat stalls since they bought both franchises two years ago, which he said have supported the daily sale of groceries and made more profitable acquisitions.
Previous supermarket attempts to renovate the beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested the joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but cooperation ended after a contradiction on how to split the profits from chemical stores in the supermarket.
A new strategy arose after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical store businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical franchise, worth £125 million, three years ago.
It was announced that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding various luxury brands of skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the look and nuances on beauty kiosks to improve the atmosphere for the sake of our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand series was designed so as to fit all needs, enticing environments and convenient locations signifying that we are currently an enticing goal that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones ‘growls' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a deal worth £11 million
Dragons Den star Peter Jones went ‘with a growl' after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million lifestyle business deal to focus more on her new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby didn't have time to manage their trademark home appliances and accessories, Truly.
The couple's business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host This Morning, aged 37, used her Instagram account to announce that she was out.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons star" Den, Petes Jones angered by withdrawing at the last moment, from their lucrative branded lifestyle business - to focus on her greater contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources state that Jones was so "narrating" when the TV's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business royal headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - was worth up to £1.5 million - meaning she no longer had enough time to devote to the trademark of household appliances and their accessory, Truly.
Their business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune by £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew off from Britain towards one of her vacation homes,
A source said: "Truly is by far Holly's most important priority.
It was going to be his long-term future, which will keep him going for decades to come.
His decision to step down left everyone involved in the field of wonderment.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, very near the time of launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's main office ready for sale"
Experts believe the departure of host This Morning, which is one of the most expensive British stars, can cost the company up to millions of dollars due to large investments in product form, from pillows and candles to clothing and home supplies, as well as potential delays in further launches.
And this could mean the end of a long-established friendship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin had been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones owned 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of an ITV show called I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on this business relationship."
Speaking seriously ‘and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for making comments that some regarded as "unpresidential" and had been very positive towards North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a voice of ridicule of his "newsreader".
"I didn't give up anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting a second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which was hailed by Trump as a step forward to denuclearize North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the meeting in June in Singapore, North Korea's highest diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders in. the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an appropriate "response" from the United States against the initial movement of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump looked more optimistically at his series of speeches.
"We're doing our best with North Korea," he said.
"If we go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have this incredible relationship,"
He said that his success in repairing relations with Kim had brought positive results - stopping rocket experiments, helping free hostages and returning the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd rather have about 200 people standing there," said Trump, pointing towards the crowd that was right in front of it.
Indonesian Tsunamis and Earthquakes Destroy an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-government foreign organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population is homeless, there is no statement of a national disaster, as a prerequisite for bringing in international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, then this is rather challenging," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save The Children were putting together a team to leave for Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff could work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster countermeasures agency, said that Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign agencies were allowed to contribute to providing assistance.
In view of Indonesia’s constant shaking of the earth, the country is still very unprepared for natural anger.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other shorelines.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a distress alert has already been made, has likely contributed to casualties.
At the best of times, travel among many Indonesian islands was challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The floating hospital that had been housed in Lombok to care for the earthquake victims was heading to Palu, but it would take at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to Indonesia's damaged infrastructure as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on the construction of highways and railroads.
But lack of funds has disrupted Mr. Joko's government while he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions still ongoing in Indonesia, where the majority Muslim members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes when Muslim and Christian hordes fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Witness: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge put in a balancing goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat against Chelsea on the Premier League by one score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received bait from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from outside Chelsea's goal when his team was 1-0 behind.
He put the ball on his left side before kicking it towards the far pole.
His ball soared high above the goal when the ball soared into the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and the players like Shaq always played it forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and take one chance and don't think about it too much, and just do the kick."
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the middle of the first after Belgian reliable player Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue attacker gave feedback to Mateo Kovacic on the game, before spinning near the middle line and running fast into the central part of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly baited and ran in the middle line.
He then did a perfect kick, leading Hazard towards goal.
Hazard made it past the opponent's defender and kicked the ball into the corner of the goal with a left foot kick, passing Liverpool goaltender Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fought Naples in the Champion League group sweep at 3 p.m. Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faced Videoton in the UEFA European League at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
Death toll in Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunamis has grown to 832, states the country’s disaster agency on Sunday morning.
Many people are reported to have been trapped in the ruins of buildings destroyed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and triggered a 20-foot wave, said Sutopo Purwo, the agency's spokesperson at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32 years old, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation was made after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John street, at 7.55 a.m. with multiple stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was detained on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked the surrounding person who saw or heard something to come face to face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still at an early stage but I asked everyone who was around John's street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashboard camera to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who were convinced that they knew the woman had come to the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing as police have said, they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just returned to his apartment, but is informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man can't say anything when he finds out what's going on.
Currently the citizens are being told that it will take several hours until they are allowed to reenter.
A police officer was heard telling someone that all areas are now being enacted as a crime scene.
A woman appears on site in a crying state.
He's always repeating ‘this is terrible'.
At 2:00 p.m. two police vans were in line and the others were outside.
A number of officers stood in line to monitor the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message directly to @MerPolCc, phone 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at number 0800 555 111 by citing log 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament became the last memorial to be affected by ‘the rewriting of history'
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the destruction of ala-Taliban against many British cultural and religious artifacts carried out by fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell society described Mr. Crick's advice as "foolishness" and "tried to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "This is inevitable in the current debate about the destruction of the statues, that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace of Westminster would be a target.
British civil war iconoclasm was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong descendant of Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The remarkable representation of Cromwell from Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is an evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure which many still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, in his case of course the kingdom.
Whether it is a fully accurate representation, is still the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure that represents one side of that distinction.
His success as Lord Protector also deserves to be celebrated and commemorated."
Killer Pig Persecuted Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeastern Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, covered in blood near a pigsty in the Liupanshui area market of Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reporting on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepared to inject a vaccine into pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining Qinghai province, China.
He is reported to have gone with his cousin from the neighbouring region of Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next day, his cousin finds him dead, and sees the door of a nearby pigsty has opened.
He said that in the pigsty there was a big pig with blood in its mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the 550-pound pig has abused the breeder to death, according to reports.
"Betis my cousin was bleeding and crushed," said the cousin known as the "Wu" clan, as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man doesn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had already been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reported to be negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig assault on humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their field in Massachusetts resulting in the man being seriously injured.
10 years earlier, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until the wife frightened and drove the beast away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were usually not aggressive but the scent of blood could act as "triggers".
"They're just playing around.
They're biters, very curious they won't come out to hurt you.
You just have to give him enough respect," he said
The remnants of Rosa's storm brought torrential rains extending southwest of the United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over cooler waters on Mexico's north coast.
In any case, Rosa will cause flooding rains throughout the northern and southwestern regions of Mexico in the United States a few days to come.
Rosa has winds at 85 mph, Category 1 storms, starting at 5 a.m. on Sunday Eastern Region time, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa probably moved northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Trench began forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving east, towards the U.S. West Coast, when Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began pushing tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the US.
Rosa will bring rain to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rains in the Southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous floods, debris streams and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to near 2 to 3 inches per hour at some point, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
A total of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected to fall in some parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
A flash flood is likely to occur with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is highly unadvised to explore the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause the gorge to become a vicious river and the storm will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching Trench will cause local heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall that exceeds half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to become slippery.
This would be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Several scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before the rains become wider on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will expand to four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some severe changes in temperature across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature within short distances.
There are precise examples of dramatic temperature differences along central U.S. territory on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer warmth will form and again spread.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. areas are expected to begin to warm beginning in October at a spreading speed of 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show high chances for above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. to mid-October.
Over 20 million people have witnessed the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular events to preach an unexpected last minute incident Friday: An agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure if Kavanaugh groped her body in a drunken state and tried to take her clothes off at a High School party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
There are likely to be over 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, having watched it.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Counting for other networks broadcasting this is not quickly available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen used to have trouble counting the number of people who saw him at the office.
To put this in perspective, it is an almost equal number of viewers to a football playoff game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose host opinion strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, excelled all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during an all-day trial, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million viewers and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Fans remained high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in the Friday play.
After a moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being yelled at by protesters when he tried to board an elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood down for a few minutes when he was cursed, broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think that he's telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power when there are many helpless women.''
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there was much else he needed to say in the committee hearing.
Cable TV and broadcast networks all covered live a few hours later, when the Justice Committee would vote to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy throughout the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would examine the allegations against the candidate for a week to come, as the minority Democrats have requested.
Flake has been convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Post conversation with the Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had powers, as it was clear that the Republican party would not have a vote to approve Kavanaugh without any investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister accused critics of ‘playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging national interests, for her plans to quit the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, 29 September 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews featuring him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson emphasized the attack on what he called Chequers' plan for Brexit, saying that proposals about the UK and EU that should collect tariffs on each other were "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect at a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during a fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said that they found Simpson's DNA on the item, WAFB affiliate CBS reported.
After interrogating Simpson, police said that she claimed to have committed a fatal shooting of Wayde.
The contract had been set at $350,000, the Advocate reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head until it went through the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police fugitive task force, the state police criminal lab, the Southern University police and surrounding citizens in aid of the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked county law enforcement for "sufficiency and the search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old at the time.
At 6.6 feet living in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Points averaged him 5.6 and soared to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "destroyed" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
‘"Here's what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
Volcanoes spew ash in Mexico City
The ash coming out of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern area around the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after growing activity in the crater and registered there were already 183 gas and ash emissions in over 24 hours.
The center monitors several roars and tremors.
The images on social media show a thin layer of ash attached to the windshield of a car in the neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The Volcano is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence election celebration.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-establishment demonstration participants clashed with riot police, and when thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarization vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by riot police pelted them with eggs and threw powder paint, thus creating a dark cloud of dust in the streets that would normally be filled by tourists.
The dispute also took place later that day with police using their staffs to control the dispute.
For several hours pro-establishment groups shouted "No forgetting, no forgiveness" face-to-face with union protesters who shouted, "Life of Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in that protest, the local press reported.
Tensions remained high in this free-oriented region, a year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters preferred to become independent, although voters were low by the presence of those opposed to secession and mostly boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting in polls across the region in fierce clashes.
Pro-establishment groups have camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support the national police.
Demonstrations continued but were forced to take different routes.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attends separatist protests with his wife saying she no longer hopes about the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out in joy of being able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory despite the few in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-liberated parties have fought to maintain the momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in exile or in custody awaiting trial, for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with her phone to support the police, said that the conflict had been triggered by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense now," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one in nine Catalan leaders imprisoned pre-trial since the end of last year, announced that he will run in next year's European Parliament election.
"Standing as a candidate for the European election is the best way to denounce setbacks in the democratic values and oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How Many Men were arrested after a house was hit with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage occurred to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired towards the car at some point.
The goal scored by Menga has given Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers.
Dolly's first goal Gives up for Livingston ensures victory
Livingston's victory resulted in the Rangers firing Steven Gerrard from his post as Ibrox's club manager, for his second loss in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's attack has been evidence of differences when Gary Holt's side movement was equivalent to Hibernian's in second.
Gerrard's side remains winless in the Premiership this season and faces Hearts leaders who are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers entertained Rapid Vienna in the European League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their undefeated record in the division to six games, whereas head coach Holt still tasted the defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost his chance against a team of sloppy guests.
Holt's team should've excelled long before they scored, with their precision giving the Rangers various difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his attempt missed across the face of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only widen his efforts after sliding in and dealing with the sundulan Craig Halkett from across the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play superior early on, knowing that they could make it difficult for the arrival team to happen to the dead ball.
And that's how to produce a very important goal.
Rangers broke free kicks and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Mengan, who got a turn and scored from midfield.
By that stage, the Rangers had dominated the mastery but realized that the host's defenses were impenetrable and goaltender Liam Kelly as a whole uninterrupted,
That pattern continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to lure a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was jegaled by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's legs and Lithgow was knocked away as a result of another Livingston game tactic.
The attack continued to come to Livingston's goal and was constantly averted, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were rejected.
‘Fenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
For a man, they are remarkable, continuing to transcend expectations on this ever-increasing course.
Their style of play and personnel has been virtually unchanged since they returned to the top, but large credits must be given to Holt for the way he strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert during the game.
Nevertheless, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was not good - just once they could break up the home side formation - and it was a warning to the Rangers, who were aware of their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdoğan received a diverse welcome in Cologne.
There was a smile and a stretch of blue sky on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdoğan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They differed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkish entry into the EU.
Erdoğan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
It is home to the largest population of Turks who are outside Turkey.
Police mentioned security reasons for blocking a crowd of 25,000 gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protestors - many of them Kurds - also spoke out, denouncing both, Erdoğan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The resistance protests described there being a contradiction to the existence of an immigrant who was greeted as a hero by some German Turkish residents and reviled as a dictator by other residents.
Collisions on the Deptford highway: Cycling driver killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near the portion of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car had stopped and paramedics came, however the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about 1 mile away from Saturday's collision.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers were trying to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads were closed and a diversion of bus lanes had been imposed as well as motorists were heralded to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six of the guards sustained injuries in a riot in the men's prison with tight guard, the lapas office stated.
Chaos ensued in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and still continues.
Specialist officer "Tornado" has been deployed to deal with the riots, involving eight prisoners and occurring on one side of the building.
The officers were treated at the scene for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesperson said: "Specially trained lapas officers have been deployed to deal with the incident that is taking place at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have already been treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in this prison, and it is clear that the responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the warden was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October of last year a riot officer was called to prison to deal with a serious riot in which a lapas officer was attacked with a billiard ball.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flooding
The tropical depression that hit Arizona is rare, but that's what's likely to happen early next week because the remaining traces of Hurricane Rosa's energy pass through the southwestern desert, leading to the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of a flood on Monday and Tuesday for the Western Arizona region to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to lead directly past Phoenix on Tuesday, about to hit on Monday night accompanied by rain.
The National weather service in Phoenix mentioned in twitter that there were only "ten tropical hurricanes capable of inflicting tropical storms or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix territory since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border region."
The latest Storm Center props were able to predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with isolated amounts reaching 6 inches in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the southwestern desert include the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to be exposed to 1 to 2 inches, with a possible amount of isolation reaching 4 inches.
For those in flood-free regions, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing because the region is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be profitable because the southwest region is currently in drought.
According to U.S. United States drought observers, only about 40 percent of Arizona's territory experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the path through Hurricane Rosa leads to land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico
Rosa, still at storm strength on Sunday morning at wind speeds of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles northbound from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encountered cooler areas of water in the Pacific and was therefore weakened in strength.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with tropical storm power by Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall may be high in parts of Mexico, leading to high flood risks
"Total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected to hit Baja California region all the way to the southwestern region of Sonora, possibly rising to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa would cross the northern part along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday early morning as a tropical depression, which would pass through Arizona and into southern Utah by midnight Tuesday.
"The main risk that a Rosa storm may cause or the remains is very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern region of Sonora, and the U.S. southwest region of the U.S. desert." National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated.
The rain is expected to cause the threat of floods and debris of buildings flowing into the desert, and a landslide ensues in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: Arrest of four suspected attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old teenage boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton region, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was in stable condition.
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-old teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset region, Police said.
Officers have called anyone who may have a video of the incident on his cell phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh ‘accepted the hatred and anger' of the Democratic Party
"One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and humiliating scheme," Trump said on a campaign in Wheeling, western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "accepted the hatred and anger" of the Democratic Party during the candidacy process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, by being forced and emotionally denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually assaulted him decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The President said on Saturday that "The Americans saw Kavanaugh's intelligence and quality as well as courage that day.
"One vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to corroborate someone who has the most perfect legal thought in our time, a jury with a true public servant's track record," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's candidacy while talking about the importance of Republican participation in mid-election.
"Five weeks before there was one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really racing," he said.
"That's why I go around, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "fight and block."
The first voting procedure at the Senate level in Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to be implemented at the latest Friday, a GOP senior leader aide said on CNN.
Hundreds died due to Indonesian quakes, tsunamis, with increasing numbers of casualties
At least 384 people were killed, many were washed away when giant waves hit the coast, when a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when a six-metre-high (18 feet) wave destroyed the beach at dusk, causing many deaths and destroying anything it passed.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a strength of 7.5.
"As the tsunami threat escalated yesterday, people are still doing their activities on the beach and not immediately running so they become victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Disaster Countermeasures Agency (BNPB) said at the time of the climate in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, wood, houses, crashing into everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed the high seas at 800 kph (497 mph) before crashing into the shoreline.
Some people climbed trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Air photos issued by the BNPB show many destroyed buildings and shops, crooked and collapsed bridges as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent aftershocks rocked the city along the coast on Saturday.
A string of earthquakes was felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Technology Research and Applying Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb explosive that was dropped on Hiroshima in the second World War.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, can enlarge the size of the tsunami, it can be said.
Nugroho described the damage that occurred as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of several of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 people injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage could have been greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "is completely paralyzed with the absence of information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their members and volunteers were heading towards the region affected by the disaster.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse," he said.
The related instance that Saturday received much criticism for not informing him that a tsunami hit Palu, although authorities say that a wave had already hit by the time the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man upstairs in a building shouting a panic warning of a tsunami approaching, toward people on the street below.
Within minutes a roll of water hit the beach, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately prove the authenticity of the tape.
Earthquakes and tsunamis were the biggest cause of power outages that cut off communications around Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but refugees still desperately need food and other basic needs.
The Airport has already reopened only to channel relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesian Tsunami casualties are rising above 800.
That's terrible.
When the employees of the World Vision of Donggala had made it safely to the town of Palu, where the employees took refuge in a tarp cloth tent built in their office yard, on their way they had passed through various ravaged areas, said Mr Doseba.
"They tell me that they've seen a lot of destroyed homes," he said.
It's so horrible.
Even as aid groups began to move slowly to begin disaster relief activities, some of the group complained of a ban on foreign volunteers with expertise, who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, foreign aid and energy can only begin to channel if the affected area has been officially declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a province-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"At the time the Government said, OKE, this is a national disaster," we were able to receive International aid, yet there has been no such status."
On the second night of the post-shock and tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing victims still hope that their loved ones will be part of a miracle that will fix the dreary storyline of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman pinned under the rubble for two days with the mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has coached two missing paragliding athletes, who were able to attend the Asian Games which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those still trapped in the Roa-Roa Hotel, along with Mr Mandagi, are his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my emotional burden personally," he said.
Mr. Gendon recounts how after the news of the ruined Roa-Roa Hotel circulated around the paragliding community, he desperately sent a message of WhatsApp to the Palu competitors, who participated in the celebrations on the beach.
Nevertheless, all the messages, they only get one gray tick, not two blue ticks.
"I think it means the message wasn't sent," he said.
The robber took $26,750 during an ATM charge at Newport in Levee
The robbery on Friday morning, stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was reloading an ATM storage box in Newport, based on a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car has emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and is preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy writing in a news release.
While he was working, another man "ran from behind Brink's workers" and stole a bag of money to be sent.
Eyewitnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, based on the news, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identity can contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, she wrote: "The one once formally known as Kanye West."
West, aged 41, already had a nickname Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change was made before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, as she was expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
She replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, previously West said that for him the word had religious meaning.
"I believe ‘ye' is a word commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘You," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with Radio Big Boy announcer.
"So I am you, I am we, that name is us.
The name is derived from Kanye, which means only the one, being Ye - as a mirror of our goodness, our vices, our confusions, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we really are."
He's one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs in various ways has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, however this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a connecting sign and Big letters.
The President of Mexico, AMLO, vowed not to use the military in the face of civil society
The President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had already vowed never to use military force against civil society ahead of the 50th anniversary of a bloody countermeasure against students.
Lopez Obrador promised a day on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to suppress the Mexican people."
The troops launched gunfire at a peaceful demonstration activity in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people that time, when the movement of left-wing students implanted its roots throughout Latin American territory.
Lopez Obrador has already guaranteed support for young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those in college and opening more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encourage young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the A.I. funding.
Since China is more active in terms of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funds to be used for research in that field, said investor and practitioner A2 Kai-Fu Lee, who is already working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. as a whole lacked formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plans last year: it aims to be number 1 in its 2030 AI innovation.
"Multipling AI research funds is a good start, considering all other countries tend to be left away from the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the AI field," Lee said.
Duplicating the funds could double the odds so that the next major achievement of AI will be made in the U.S., Lee told on CNBC in an interview on this week's day.
Lea, owner of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was already published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Synnovation Ventures, who has already invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University she designed an AI system that defeated the best American Othello players, and after that she served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google..
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competition such as the Robotics Challenge to the Mutakhir Defense Research Project and asked when the next activity would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often had to work hard to win prizes from the Government, Lee said.
"It wasn't China that took the lead academically; it was the company," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have already employed figures from universities for AI research in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help U.S. to support efforts surrounding AI.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically for PHD degree holders in AI fields," he said.
The Chinese Council of State issued the Next Generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Natural Science Foundation provides funds for people at academic institutions just like the way the Natural Science Foundation and other governmental Organizations are distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic tasks is lower in China, Lee said.
Early this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage industrial and academic partners, and the White House party announced the Committee's Selection formation for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA (The Mutakhir Defense Research Agency) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, recently DARPA invested over 100 million dollars a year for AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requesting the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence saw no follow-up for months.
The Macedonian people voted in order to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday to decide on changing the country's name to "North Macedonia Republic," an act that would settle a decade-long dispute with Greece that had bid its membership to become part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains the opinion that the name of that northern neighboring country represents the recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned the joining of the country with NATO and the European Union.
Both sides of the government reached an agreement in June based on the new name raised, however the nationalist opposition argued that changes would damage the identity of most ethnic Macedonian populations.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not give his vote to the general election and a boycott campaign has instilled doubts as to whether the election results could reach the minimum number of 50 percent of the votes required for the election results to be declared valid.
The question found on the ballot reads: "Do you approve of NATO and EU membership by accepting any agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price worth paying in order to get permission into bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born from the destruction of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to cast my vote for the future of the country, for the sake of the younger generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, quite a few MPs said they would comply with the results of the vote to make the decision.
The name change requires a vote of two thirds in parliament.
The state election commission said there had not been any reports of a breach until 1 p.m.
Nevertheless, it turned out that polling results only reached 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters gave their vote letters.
"I came to cast my vote for the sake of my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote letters for elections in Macedonia in order to change the name of the country that would pave the way for the country in order to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov had already prepared a small stage and pulled up seats in front of tents made by those who would boycott the vote.
"We agreed to join NATO and the European Union, but we would like to join with honorably, not through the door of servants" Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia as well as be part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring in more investments necessary for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most of the population will agree to it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his ballot.
He said the "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institution on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the required amount.
Another poll, held by the TV station Telma Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents who planned to share in the Sunday vote.
Of them, 70 percent said it would vote yes.
For the vote to be successful, 50 percent plus 1 vote was required.
A failure in the polls will represent the first denial of policy against the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City explored Brighton's entire defense to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling deployed as Brighton's defense on Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Stadium Etihad, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his score in the 65th minute.
Argentine attackers received an pass in midfield at the start of the match.
He ran among three of Brighton's Defenders, before recklessly going into the open field.
Aguero later found himself surrounded by four green-shirted men.
He twisted past one man's defender before running ahead of some of his opponents again at the end of Brighton's goal.
Then he passes to his left, to Sterling.
The English front quarterback took advantage of his first kick from the goal direction to pass the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton's goaltender Mathew Ryan by a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems on his feet," Pep Guardiola City manager told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal occurred in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, deep within Brighton territory on that game.
He passed the ball with a stunning away kick through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little bumping the ball before leading Sterling to the furthest post.
Sky Blue's forward quarterback dribbled the ball towards the goal just before the ball slid out of the border.
City fought Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match at 12:55 p.m. Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to complain about the spoilers versus the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff game, there was no more reason to impose another game.
But the overcompetitive Scherzer hoped to outlast the Colorado Rockies on Sunday games, but only if there were still implications of the playoffs for the Rockies, who excelled in one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies had at least earned a place after winning in a wild-card game against the Nationals by a score of 5-2 on Friday night, however were still trying to achieve their first division title.
"Although we played without winning, we could at least know the atmosphere in Denver with a crowd of spectators and other teams who would compete at the highest level of any point I might face this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a match?"
The Nationals haven't announced the opening game for Sunday, but it's been reported that under the circumstances, they tend to let Scherzer play.
Scherzer, who will start the fight for the 34th time, held practice sessions on Thursday and started Sunday games that are usually used to rest.
Washington's right-handed pitcher was an 18-7 scorer with a 2.53 run average and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings of this session.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The President impliedly referred to a situation concerning the future Supreme Court Justice of his choice, Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the outcome of the Republican public vote in mid-election.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before the run of the most important election of our lives.
It's one of the great, great -- I don't really run that's why I fight in all places for incredible candidates," he said.
Trump goes on, "You see a radical group of very, very horrible Democrats, you can see it's happening right now.
And they decided to take back power in any way, you see evil, their abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to gain power and control, that's what they want, that's power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "murka and evil and vile and untrustworthy."
He referred to Senate Dianne Feinstein who served on the Senate Justice Committee by saying her name, which was greeted with loud reviling from her listeners.
"Remember what the answer is?
Did you leak those documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for him - it's a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labor Party is no longer a public service site.
Now be intolerant to anyone who puts his mind to it.
When Momentum activists at my local party voted to denounce myself, it was not surprising.
After all, I was in last place Members of Parliament, who were told that our presence was not expected - all because we expressed our opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she defended antisemitism decisively.
In my case, the censure movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
As to the importance of responsible economic policies, on national security, in Europe, the issue is ironically the same as that opposed by Jeremy Corbyn with previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting of the labourers of eastern Nottingham on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on Friday Night was exactly that way.
Unfortunately on this day, the nature of many meetings and promises regarding "better, friendlier" politics has not long been forgotten, if, indeed it ever began.
Opinion differences in the labour party were becoming more clearly intolerable and each opinion was judged its worthiness by party authority.
It started as soon as Jeremy became a leader, as a colleague who I had thought would share the same political views, began expecting me to turn around and accept a position that I would never accept before - neither in national security nor in a single European market.
Whenever I speak openly - and no matter what I say - then afterwards there will be a reviling in the social media that asks for a cancellation of the appointment, reproaching central politics, telling me I shouldn't have served in the Labour party.
And it's not just me.
Of course, I know that I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire professionalism and the limitations of my colleagues who face sexual abuse or racism every day but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects in today's political era is how much abuse levels have been considered natural.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should have helped develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is we are no longer on a wider church and with each motion of "no confidence" or changing the selection of party regulations becomes more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the past two years that prompted me to keep my head down, not very voiced opinions, and then I would say "okay."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago while still a school student, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher's government which resulted in my comprehensive school classes literally collapsing, I have been trying to fight for better public service for those who desperately need it - both as local counselors and ministers in government.
I never hid my political action, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East would question my policy position and the things I don't agree with in current leadership.
For those who advocate a motion on Friday, all I can say is when the country moves rapidly towards a split of sovereignty (Brexit), it will endanger our country's business and public services, I don't want to waste time and energy for the sake of loyalty to the leader of the Labour party.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, as a member of the Labour party or not.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The invincible Ayr rises to the top position
The last two tries may have been a bit of a cheat of the final results, but there's no doubt Ayr deserves to win a Tennent's Premiership match which is very entertaining today.
Now they are top of the line, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and ability to achieve the best odds, which made the home team and coach Peter Murchie get the right to be happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still undefeated so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "A tribute to Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, however a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, given on that game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a chance to score and Jason Baggot cut an unconverted try.
Climo loosened Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, just in the middle of time, she scored then made a single try to make Ayr's score to 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started the second mid well and Patrick Anderson's attempted convert by Baggot, reducing odds to five points.
Then there was a long pause because Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury, was hammered out, and since the start of the match, Ayr has gone faster beyond Stafford McDowall's attempts, converted by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then hit by a yellow card and again, Melrose made a backup player pay with Bruce Colvine's unaltered try, at the end of hard pressure.
The host had returned to play, however, by the time Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for winding Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind an injured Ayr who advanced.
Climo was replaced, as it happened again, almost from the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe made a goal kick and thwarted Gregor's fifth attempt at the oper Henry.
Still Game star looks ready to live his new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Kieran was seen ready to switch course to the service industry after it had been discovered that he was crowned as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which was directed and also starred with his old comedian partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pair had already announced that the ninth series to come was the final episode, and apparently Kiernan planned to guide the live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to the official recording list, she is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was trying to engage in "the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes that the court will re-open the passage to the Pacific.
Sailors conducted patrols at the headquarters of the laureates located in La Paz.
The public building raised a blue sea flag.
The Naval Base from Titicaca to Amazon was polished with a motto: "The Sea is our lawfully owned right.
To rise again is an obligation."
Passing through Bolivia surrounded by land, the memory of the defeat of a coastline to Chile in a 19th-century bloody conflict is still clear - like the desire to once again sail the Pacific Ocean.
That hope likely culminated in decades, for Bolivia was awaiting a decree from the court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and certainly positive hope about the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ trial on screen across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia's demands that - after decades of that tense negotiations -Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia's guarantee of sovereignty over the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous President of Bolivia—who faces controversial warfare for next year's re-election—also has a lot of support at Monday's trial.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific Sea," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that a court is unlikely to decide Bolivia's wishes- and that would only change slightly if that were possible.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to give up Chilean territory, and has already decreed that it will not decide the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the ICJ statute comes just six months after the final argument already heard, which indicates the case is "uncomplex," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean international legal expert.
And still a long way from continuing Bolivia's demands, in the last four years it may have been a setback.
"The problem with access to the sea is being hijacked by the Bolivian government now," said .
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has weakened the good ichtikad of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will still negotiate, but it will be very difficult to keep discussing after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian government representative in The Hague rejected the idea of decision-making quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual gain," he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales-still one of Latin America's most famous presidents- is using maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never relinquish its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The trial is an opportunity to see if we need to finish the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never disarm a nuclear weapon if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the time of the UN General Congregation.
He mentioned about the United States carrying out a deal made at the time of a meeting in Singapore between competing leaders.
His comments came about as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was seen almost beginning a nuclear diplomacy that had been deadlocked for more than three months after a meeting with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri said only a "semual dream" that by continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the Korean War settlement declaration would lead North Korea to surrender.
Washington was on guard to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang making an attempt to restrict the armed forces first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump would like to have a second meeting.
But there is a widespread doubt that Pyongyang is earnest about the recognition of the armory which for the country is the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump
The Paris fashion show shows a lot of recent collections of head coverings all the way to the main road near you.
If you want to multiply the hat collection or really want to be protected from sunlight don't look for anything else.
Designer Valentino and Thom Browne issued a series of large sized head covers for their SS19 collection on the fashion show stage in a stunning style held at Paris Fashion Week.
A completely impractical hat swept Instagram this summer, and these designers have already shown us some amazing creations on the show.
A prominent feature of Valentino is the creamy - colored hat over which is decorated with a wide rim of fur covered in the model’s head.
Large size accessories include a watermelon decorated with diamonds, a witch hat and even a pineapple, yet not made to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a collection of strange masks—and right before Halloween.
A lot of different color masks that have their lips sewn up and look like Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
A skuba diving gear-like creation is equipped with snorkels and glasses, while others look like melted ice cream.
And if you keep tracing that great collection of modes-- then you're being lucky.
Fashion observers estimate that the large hat collection will be marketed to the main road near you.
Large sized hats became a very bestseller trend in ‘La Bomba', a straw hat with a two-foot wide rim seen wearing everyone including Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The worship of labels behind very impractical hats splashing from social media makes a huge creation on catwalk beaches of straw almost the same size as a bathing suit - worn with a sash model.
The burnt orange rafia bag, sheared with rafia on the edge with white handle straps, is an outstanding thing from Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity hairdresser Luke Armitage said on FEMAIL: "I hope seeing a big hat and a beachbag arrive on the main road for next summer – since designers are already making a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for such a large accessory'
John Edward: Language skills are vital to global citizens
Scottish private schools keep track records of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with overwhelming test results, which were further strengthened by each student and collective success in sports, arts, music as well as hard work.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Board (SCIS) strive to provide the best services for the students and parents.
The independent school aims to prepare its students for advanced and higher education, careers of their choice, and their role as citizens of the world.
As an education sector that can design and implement the school curriculum as expected, we see modern language continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, your speech will get into his head.
If you talk to him in his language then your speech will go into his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's latest exam, we can see that language is at the top of the league table with the highest grades of graduation in a self-governing school.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn foreign languages get an A Plus.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools that show that 72 percent of students get an A Plus in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent who learn Spanish also get an A.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important skill that will certainly be required by children and adolescents in the future.
Today languages, as a selection of subjects, are held in the same standard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the modern school curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Service in 2014 found that of some reasons why the workmen should continue to struggle to fill the vacancy, 17 percent why is the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are further encouraged to prepare youths for their future careers.
With increased employment opportunities that require language skills, these skills are important in the global world.
Whatever one’s choice of career, if they have learned a second language, in the future they will experience the real benefits of having this kind of lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with residents from a foreign country would automatically make a multilingualist excel in competition.
According to a YouGov poll on over 4,000 English adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct the conversation and French became the only spoken language in two percentage digits, which was 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for children today is important for now.
Having a multilingual ability, especially the language of countries with a growing economy, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach the language considered the most important in England for the next few years, which is 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest may be, there will always be a number of languages that can be chosen in an independent school, with an expert teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are intended to provide learning environments that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be denied that today, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect of determining the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
The self-governing school will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence for Scottish youths.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Self-Employed Schools
LeBron will debut for the Lakers on Sunday at San Diego
The fans' wait to see LeBron James begin his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not been determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play just a few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At the stage of my current career, I don't have to do preseason matches to prepare for," he said.
Trump Public Meeting Schedule in West Virginia, YouTube Canal
President Donald Trump begins tonight's campaign general meeting rush in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This was Trump's first public meeting of five public meetings scheduled for next week, including stops at several fun places covering Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was asserted that the vote was postponed in order for him to vote for the Supreme Court's office, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming half-time elections because the Republicans were at risk of losing control of Congress if the vote was made in November.
What time is Trump's public meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's public meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's public meeting in West Virginia online via a live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss a hearing this week for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is increasingly tense after allegations of indecent sexual acts and estimates of Senate voting will be postponed to one week while the FBI investigates him.
But the main goal of this general meeting agenda is to help the Republican party to gain some momentum in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign it is mentioned that five public meetings in next week are aimed at "engaging volunteers and supporters because the Republican party is trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House," according to Reuters.
"Controversy control is so important for its agenda that the president will as much as possible travel to the states as long as we face a busy campaign season," Trump's unnamed campaign spokesman relayed to Reuters.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling, tonight's public meeting is expected to present supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as attract coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, a state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump tried to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican West Virginia Senate candidate left behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come as an effort to increase his gains in the polls," said Simon Haeder, political expert at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team marches bravely defending its hopes in the face of a single match Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome session was the one that might be required in this Ryder Cup.
The spindle swing of momentum is a concept of sport that is the result of findings fully trusted by the players, and nothing exceeds than in competitions like this.
Where do they think the momentum is right now?
"Before, they were six points ahead and now four, so I think we regarded it as a bit of momentum," Jordan Spieth said as it passed that day.
Surely Europe has the advantage of excelling four points with twelve more games.
But Team America, as Spieth said, felt they had a bit of momentum and they had a lot of things that could be spirited, no exception to the formation of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasted three out of four points.
Spieth has played deadlyly from the tee area to the green area and leads with exemplaryness.
The clamor of the celebrations grew louder as his turn came, doing an important putting punch to make the match a series as he and Thomas lost two to two.
A blow putting from him that won them on a 15 that was greeted with a similar scream, a scream that tells you that he believes America is not defeated.
"You really should try harder and worry about your own matches," Spieth said.
All these players are gone now.
18 holes that need to be marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed tale of the Ryder Cup.
The unique but interesting pairing from Europe is four for four and can do without error.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to do a bogey punch on Saturday afternoon, but they were also spared bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seemed to flow both to and from this boisterous crowd that assured that they were players to be defeated on Sunday, and no player was more famous than Fleetwood nor Molinari who would lock the potential of European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It is better if at the same time both are placed in different holes.
Still, it is too early to talk about European victories.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shorten the work of Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when she is paired with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on a nine front like digging a hole that can never be climbed by this Spanish and Swedish golfer.
Although, on Sunday no one can help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are nice shows to look at closer because of interactions between couples, advice they give, advice they don't give and how strategies can change instantly.
So far, Europe played better as a team and led far enough into the final day, but foursome sessions also showed that the U.S. team had the guts to compete despite some doubts, especially in the United States.
Europe topped 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will capitalize on the advantages of Ryder Cup's final day after rising from a fourball and foursome match Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The Tommy Fleetwood inspired duo and Francesco Molinari took the lead with two wins over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to record their points so far at Le Golf National by four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to retain the trophy they never had in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the mistargeted American team in the morning fourball, making the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in the foursome, winning two games, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team required eight points from 12 singles Sunday games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debutant to win four consecutive points, while she and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, only became the second pair to win four points from their game opening four in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball they became very solid to defeat the embattled Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a firmer 5&4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally performed brilliantly but he had already lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome as well as seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting on the morning fourball, then returned to pair with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2&1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three worlds.
Europe did not achieve it on its own despite the day being pleasant and windy in southwestern Paris.
Three-time main winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a measure for America by two points on Saturday.
They got an exciting 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in fourball then returned again to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing the first two holes.
It has only twice occurred in Ryder Cup history where a team returned from a four-point deficit going into a single game, although as defending champions Furyk's team needed only series points to retain the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday's counterattack looked like it would surpass them.
North Korea says 'impossible' will disarm unilaterally without any trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign Minister delivered to the UN regarding sanctions that constantly deepened their distrust of the United States and it is unlikely that the country disarmed its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho presented to the annual General Assembly of that world body that North Korea has taken "significant measures showing good intentions" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear testing and missiles, dismantling nuclear testing locations, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons as well as nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there would be no confidence in our national security and in such situations it is unlikely we disarmed ourselves first unilaterally."
While Ri repeated the same complaint from North Korea about Washington's resistance on a "staged" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be punished for taking a gradual step, significant statements were delivered that they did not reject entirely as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit meeting between United States presidential officials and the new North Korean leaders this first time held in Singapore on 12 June, at which point Kim promised to strive for "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea had wanted an official end to the 1950–1953 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang should stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected the call to loosen international heavy sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insisted on "denuclearizing first" and increasing pressure by giving semi sanctions achieving their goals by force, and even rejecting "the ultimate statement of warfare,"" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions could get us to our knees is the illusion of people who don't know about us.
But, the problem is that such constant sanctions will deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump highlighted United States leaders in the United Nations earlier this week.
The Minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the troubled party in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, denuclearizing the Korean peninsula will not be up to this kind of dead end."
Nonetheless, Ri's tone of speech was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke to the UN General Court that targeting North Korean rockets on the United States mainland was inevitable after Trump's "Devil President" called Kim "a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year in a UN meeting, Trump who last year threatened to "destroy" North Korea in total, put forth praise on Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but that great work still had to be done and sanctions had to remain imposed until North Korea did denuclearize.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for this, "If this takes two years, three years or five months – no problem", he said.
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the move taken.
However, the United States Foreign Minister, Mike Pompeo, delivered to the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council should proceed decisively and should not fail until we learn that full, final and verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to stop financing Pyongyang's nuclear program and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo meets Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and says afterwards that she will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second peak meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July while saying that there had actually been progress, only that North Korea in a matter of hours stormed that itself was making "ganglike demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this moon to dismantle the missile's location as well as the nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate action."
He stated that Kim had him perform "acts appropriate" with his wishes was the security assurance Trump promised in Singapore and moved towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses about enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year made all S1 students there sleep more, in an effort against macho culture in learning which is developing through caffeine-powered 'human owls'.
An academic finds that students at the world's number one university often know nothing when discussing very fundamental matters about how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine specializing in sleep issues at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which she believed was the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to begin the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
'In the end a girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I just being told now, in my final year?'
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleep—that surprised me,' she said to The Telegraph.
The course launched first this year, explaining to students the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, and improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health care, said that the university decided to introduce this course after finding students who were severely deprived of sleep all week.
This one-hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there was an image of a dorm room, where students clicked on coffee cups, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation for the effects of caffeine and lamps, as well as how athletic results were influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleeptime routines.
On the other hand, participants get an explanation of how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think of their daily routines.
'We knew this would not change students' behavior instantly.
But we are convinced that they have a right to know—as well as you have a right to know the effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes on health,' grew Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride in 'emergence' still exists, he said, plus that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students which means sleep deprivation is an ever-growing problem.
Making sure you sleep enough, with good quality, has to be a 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain activate hunger mode, giving rise to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California resident who studied chemistry and physical biology who helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course had opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire campus.
The next step, she hopes that all graduate students will be instructed to complete a similar course of study before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting the sleep time alarm, also the wake-up alarm, and being aware of the effects of ‘blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which could shift your circadian rhythm out of its layout path causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals Bringing down the mental down of Gerrard's troops
Again, the Rangers felt the grief of the away day during the Dolly Menga attack delivering Steven Gerrard's scattered team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team attempted to record their first win on their way, since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team had just given Gerrard a second loss in 18 games as manager, causing his team to miss eight points from championship leader Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Mending attacked seven minutes before the first half was finished and the witless Rangers players did not seem to compensate.
While the Rangers now dropped to sixth, Livingston rose to third, only missing goal difference from Hibernian.
And there could be further trouble in the Rangers' stronghold after Calum Spence's line guards had to be treated for a head wound after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr to the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Instead, Holt leaves with the same Livi 11 who took one point from Hearts last week and she will be pleased with the costumes that fascinate their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may dominate ball possession, but Livingston utilizes the ball they have better.
They should've recorded the score within two minutes only when the first short bait Menga was bowled by Scott Pittman via Allan McGregor's wicket, but the quarterback drew a big chance it was too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep-seated free kick met captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide in the back position.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than confidence about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have got a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided at the quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected this Colombian citizen's appeal.
Rangers only managed to make two pitches in the first half but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was almost never troubled with Lassana Coulibaly's head sundulan and Ovie Ejaria's easily tamed attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be opposite the course of the match, no one can deny that they deserve it due to their own hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep dead ball tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet choosing Menga for the sake of a simple ending.
Gerrard acted on the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and that turnout almost had an immediate influence as that winger put the ball on Morelos but Kelly who played impressively quickly went out of line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to force the tag team to play the game exactly as they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
Holt's team was supposed to widen their lead in the final stage but McGregor stood well to repel Jacobs before Lithgow spun wide from a corner.
Rangers' understudy, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty as he quarreled with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned face to face.
Almanac: The Inventor of Geiger
And now from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and IT WILL STILL CONTINUE... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, it was an invention that ultimately made the device referred to as the Geiger Scare.
Being a science reliable tool since then, Geiger's printers have also become reliable pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring the less convincing-looking cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What is that thing?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Scare, used to locate radioactive mineral locations, such as uranium.
While using this earphone, you can actually hear the atomic effects released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, it must be popping up right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery kept his name alive.
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to ‘recognize' evil cells
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'recognize' evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize evil cells as part of the treatment
His method involves extracting immune cells from patients, altering them in laboratories.
They can then 'recognize' proteins that are common in many cancers and then inject again
An experimental vaccine showed promising results in patients with a wide range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which is what taught the immune system to recognize evil cells, her ovarian cancer was lost for over 18 months.
This method involves extraction of the patient's immune cell, changing it in the laboratory so that they can "recognize" the protein commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States National Cancer Society in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "encourages the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and colorectals, Prof Berzofsky explained.
The same approach as patient immune cell retrieval and "teaching" to them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West Starts a Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wears a MAGA Hat, After Her SNL Appearance.
Not Running Well
Kanye West was mocked at the studio during Saturday Night Live after performing chaotically where she praised United States President Donald Trump and said that she would run in 2020.
After performing a third song that night, entitled Ghost Town where she wears the Make America Great hat, she challenges the Democratic party and repeats her support for Trump.
"Sering once I talk to white people and they say: "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Yes, if I'm worried about racism, I've been out of America a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with a play starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding claims of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's caci-maki recording was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to make fun of West with the upload.
In addition, West complained to the audience that she was having trouble backstage due to the hat being worn.
"They bumped me backstage.
They say, 'Don't go out wearing that hat.'
They hit me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see a drowning spot?" said that he would wear a Superman robe, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do.
Try to love."
His comments generated scorn at least twice from the audience and the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person noting: "The whole studio was silent."
West was brought in at the last moment as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, Mac Miller's former rap singer boyfriend who had recently died a few days ago.
West confuses many with the performance of his song I Love it, dressed as the Perrier Bottle.
West had the support of TPUSA's conservative group chairman, Candace Turner who tweeted: "For one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR BUYING RAKYAT."
But host Karen Hunter wrote a tweet that West was just "being himself and that's really very nice."
"But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") whom I believe embraces and spews out ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rap singer announced on Twitter that she had changed her name, saying that she is now "a creature officially known as Kanye West."
She is not the first artist to change her name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, known also as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and certainly the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is well known for swinging swords in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
But this actor, 31, refutes the stereotypes of macho heroes, he says that roles on such screens make teenage boys often feel that they must be strong to respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he was convinced 'there was something wrong' and questioned how to deal with the problem of poor masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who had just married his playmates at Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, claimed he felt 'quite strong' in discussing the issue.
'I feel personally, quite strongly, right now - where did we go wrong in terms of this masculinity?,' he said.
'What do we teach men as they grow up, related to the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be in charge of the emergence of poor masculinity with its highly masculine characters.
He carried on: 'Which is the character from birth and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they must have this particular side to be men?
I think that's really one of the big questions in this time - how do we change it?
Because there's definitely something wrong with young men.'
In that interview she also admitted that she would not play in the prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones as this series was about to end the coming summer, saying that she was already 'done with battlefields and horses'.
Since November Kit will star in the True West's return from Sam Shepard, which is a story about the film's producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considered meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to quit the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this show, thereby giving me a family of the future, and from here my life began' she said.
Rose plays Ygritte, Kit's character love flower Jon Snow, in this Emmy award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family residence land in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% surge in new cases
China has announced a 14% surge in its population living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are infected in this country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people with HIV in this way has decreased to nearly zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, over the years the number of those living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is being called increasingly widespread.
Due to the country's conservative value, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men will eventually marry women.
Many infections of the disease come from sexual protection that is not adept in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that staff had leaked GOP senator data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
United States Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of its staff members had sent personal information of three United States Republican senators to the parliamentary Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party asserted that the claim was moved by experts and the "ultra-right wing" website.
"Lies, lies, and many more vile lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that the information released included home addresses and phone numbers of United States Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee as well as Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by an unidentified person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing regarding allegations of indecent sexual treatment of future Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
This leak appeared not long after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the shipment was connected to Waters' office and uncovered information on one of Waters' staff members, Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is completely wrong and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety are threatened as a result of deceptive and wrongful allegations - are not at all responsible for the leak of this information.
This is a falsehood and an absolute falsehood.
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including from a former White House Press Secretary named Ari Fleischer.
"This help means anger," Fleischer wrote.
"It shows he's not fit to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something that does not do it, they should not be angry.
They must not deviate.
They should not question the motives of the accuser.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism regarding Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican party candidate who was trying to shift Waters at the half-time election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned of "the proper authority and law enforcement entities regarding these wrongful allegations.
"We will ensure that the culprits will be revealed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their destructive and dangerous actions for one and all of my staff members."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - a parody of Rowan Atkinson's ill-fated spy
Currently seeking the significance of Brexit in every new film with British biased views is already a tradition and it appears to apply to the reappearance of the Johnny English fight-comedy franchise – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcasm be innuendos as to how clearly we become a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, that glaring, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has renewed his license to screw things up for the second time - his name hints more than anything else that he is a vast comic creation designed for a language cinema region other than England.
Surely he is a mad secret agent who, in spite of his bizarre suppositions, had little of the character of Clouseau, a little of Mr Bean's character and a little bit of a wanderer who contributed little of the notes to the theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Indeed, he was based on the mysterious international travelers and men Atkinson had played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving chaos behind him.
There are one or two sweet moments on this latest JE trip.
I loved it when Johnny English approached the helicopter in his medieval armor and rotor propellers quickly stuck to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy was shown, but his humor felt less powerful and too strange, especially when "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible had been confident to include comedy as material.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and to me the strange Johnny English's various misfortunes are not as novelative and as focused as Atkinson's movie-smiling jokes in Bean's personality.
The premise being warm these years is that the British are in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, uncovering the identities of all British agents in the field, to disappoint the agent on duty – unfortunately only a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This was the last chance for a proud and enemyized prime minister, who had already completely destroyed his political popularity: Emma Thompson played a very good role with the quasi-Teresa-May character but not much to work with from his script.
His intelligent advisor provided information that since every active spy had been weakened, he had to bring a person out of retirement.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English himself, now employed as a principal in some fancy buildings, but gives a secret lesson on how to perform undercover operations: there are some nice jokes here, when English offers a spy academy like the School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with a long-suffering old friend of Bough's, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, the annoyingly high-class female role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat eliminated.
So Batman and Robin make a mistake to his Majesty's Secret Agent back in action, meeting the mysterious beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister alarmingly falls into the influence of charismatic technology billionaires who claim to be able to solve British computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their ridiculous adventures: disguised as servants, they set fire to a French fast-food restaurant; they make a mess by smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury ship; and English triggers anarchy when she tries to use the headset of Virtual Reality to familiarize herself with the interior of Volta's house.
All stops are certainly drawn to the last sequence, but with such hospitality and turmoil, there are few children's TV channels that contain about everything.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And just like any Johnny English movie, I can't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits her talent?
Labor denied planning a plan for British citizens to work four days a week but was paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labor Union considered a radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week – but was paid five days.
The union reportedly wanted the owners of the company to carry on the proceeds of saving through a revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) for the workers by giving them an additional day off.
He would let the employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea would be 'pas' with the party's economic agenda and plans encouraging the country to support the workers.
The transition to four days a week has been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to experience the benefits of economic change.
A source, namely senior from the Labor Union told The Sunday Times: 'The verdict on this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'This will not happen overnight, but four working days a week is an aspiration that conforms to the party's approach in order to rebalance the economy in favor of the workers as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party had already promised four weekdays in a week on the 2017 general election campaign.
However, today the aspirations are not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: 'Four working days a week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labor conference to perfect his vision for the socialist revolution in economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from ‘anonymous directors' and ‘the painters' in utility companies.
This shadow chancellor plan also means, current shareholders in drinking water companies may not be going to regain its entire stock because the government of the Labour party can commit 'reduce' on the grounds of perceived violations.
He also ensured his plans to place workers on the company board and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that would give 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to the employees, which would pocket annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his candidacy in the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raised the question of whether the findings of this bureau could affect senators from the Republican Party to revoke their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could find something that could make them change their minds.
Looks like Kennedy's more open than his South Carolina partner.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I would attend the trial, I told you, I've already spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charges surfaced, and said, 'You did it?'
He's a firm, determined, firm man."
It seems, however, that Graham's voice will not be interchangeable.
"My mind has set a decision regarding Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs bigger charges to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but all I know is: Brett denied it out loud," Graham added, while referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he mentioned his name couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Has It Done Something to Reduce Poverty?
On this Saturday, the New York will hold the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring a row of stars performing very impressively, and a mission that is also memorable; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people coming in droves to Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of this event which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively struggling against poverty.
In order to get free tickets for the event (unless you want to pay for VIP tickets), concert visitors have to complete a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, calling, or other means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been in achieving its goals?
Is the idea of giving a gift of a free concert the right way to get people to perform an act, or is it just another case called clicktivism -- people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has recorded over 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing to set other goals.
It is said that this action has helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to over $37 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group had gathered 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, at least $10 billion of which had been channeled or carried out fundraising.
The group estimates that safe funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and executors committed to "helping children grow to their maximum potential," promising Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments, and the Global Citizen like you, we could make this social injustice regarding malnutrition a footnote in history," The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 acts performed to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions at the General Answers on their website asking "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
However, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that were before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some among the stars performing on this year's show in New York, which will be guided by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy as a "blockade" to impede Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
"If necessary" Washington can request Navy assistance to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, in its place of operation at the legitimate government's invitation - was a pretext for exploring the new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to be energy brokers, just like they did in eastern Europe, southern Europe," he reported.
And according to that official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure open sea passages, and, if necessary, to blockade, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market," he said.
Zinke spoke before the participants of the event conducted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group calling itself the "voice of energy customers" in the US.
He compared the approaches Washington made in the deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
"Economic choices in Iran and Russia are more or less, utilizing and replacing fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as one of "the experts in that field" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
This statement came about while representatives of Trump's government were on a mission in order to increase their export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, attempted to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 "unsuitable" refinery pipeline project, which Trump said, made Berlin Moscow's "arguably".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 refinery project, designed to double the pipeline capacity of this existing refinery up to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denied that Washington's harsh resistance to the project was solely driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
"I'm sure we have the same view that energy can't be made into a tool to do pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This U.S. stance has drawn a reaction from Germany, who have reaffirmed their commitment to this project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the U.S. not to interfere in European Union energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I would face a major problem if the third country interfered with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the latest meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "See the Situation" While Nominating As President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would "examine the situation" while running for president after the half-time election.
While campaigning at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren asserted he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and improve our derelict government, including putting women at the top," as he told The Hill.
"After November 6, I will take a closer look at the situation while running for president."
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning in the town hall, saying that he was "bringing this region in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned with what Donald Trump did to our democracy," he said.
Warren was blunt in delivering his criticism of Trump and future Supreme Court leader Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll released on Thursday, showed that most of Warren's own constituents did not want him running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probably" voters in Massachusetts say it is best for senators not to run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent who supported the candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run for office, with 38 percent in favor of the possibility of running for office and 48 percent opposing it.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed in connection with the possibility of running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD Track Palin at the time of Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering the army in Sept.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's going to be going through when he gets back, I can connect with other families who are also experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers have suffered," he said before the audience who were present at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest like "the elephant inside the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "they came back a little differently, they came back harder, they came back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and the airmen and every other member of the military to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence offences against a woman, coupled with reports of domestic violence and gun possession in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supported the challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia supported legal challenges to the new U.S. policy that rejected asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and this district filed friend-of-the-court briefs on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of plaintiff Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
He said his partner "and his son who is a violent gang member," had harassed him, however U.S. officials rejected his asylum request on July 20.
He's being held in Texas.
The state prosecutor in favor of Grace portrayed El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced large numbers of asylum applicants for the U.S., as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The U.S.'s new asylum policy contradicted the 2014 Immigrant appeals board's decision allowing illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that this new policy "regards existing state, federal, and international laws for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims should be decided based on certain facts and circumstances relating to such claims, and such prohibitions violate principles," friend-of-the court brief he said.
Furthermore the prosecutor gave a brief opinion that policies that refuse immigrant entry harm the U.S. economy, saying that it is likely that they will become businessmen and "employ the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang atrocities.
"It is available to those who leave their country of origin due to persecution or fear caused by issues of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion," Sessions said it in the announcement of this policy on June 11.
The Sanctuary is not meant to alleviate all problems -- although all problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue attempt in Palu as the victims doubled while racing with time to find survivors
For those who survived, the situation grew more dire.
"It's a very stressful feeling," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her baby boy who is demancing in a refugee center in the devastated town of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance comes carrying a body.
Clean water is very rare."
Citizens are seen returning to their destroyed homes, retrieving waterlogged goods, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitalized, the damage caused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, was very chaotic.
Several of those injured, including Double Haris, who suffered from spinal and shoulder fractures, were lying outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to a strong aftershock.
Her tears flow when retelling her feelings as the quake shakes her fifth floor hotel room where she is staying with her wife and daughter.
"Didn't have time to escape.
I think I pinned down the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, he added his family was in the city to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then she fell silent.
I don't know his condition and my son's.
May they be safe."
The U.S. ambassador accused China of 'doing intimidation' with 'propaganda advertisements'
A week after China's official newspaper contained a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily calling US-Tiongkok trade reciprocity profits, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday last referred to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. of congressional elections on the 6th of Nov., an allegation disputed by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election, which marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, was a new phase in the campaign's increase to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently shackled in an ever-increasing trade war, which leads them to raise rates of importation from one another.
China's reprisal tariffs at the beginning of this trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and a former governor who long led Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers, and business offenders in America.
China, Branstad wrote down an opinion on the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubling the intimidation by running propaganda advertisements on our own free media."
"In propagating his propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the tradition of free speech and the freedom of the highly valued press in America by loading paid ads on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the kiosks of street newspaper vendors here, in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and will not see the real reflection over the different opinions that Chinese people may have regarding China's troubled economic trajectory, given the media exists under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent media turned down an offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warn, Republicans Keep Women's Voters Away By Part-Time Election With Kavanaugh Disaster
Due to the barrage of important people in the Republican Party standings and defending future Supreme Court leader Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that they will see counterattacks, especially from women, at the upcoming half-time elections.
Emotions over the matter were very high, and most Republicans were recorded as already indicating that they wanted to advance on the vote.
It could not be prevented," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the encouragement of Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake at the final minute to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to defuse anger on voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for progressive group MoveOn said it on Friday, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators shouted "November is imminent!" as they staged a demonstration in the Senate hallway when the Republicans controlled the Justice Committee to continue to advance in Kavanaugh's candidacy regardless of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will be off the list," non-party political analyst Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
"People say it's high enough; and it's true.
But it could be even higher, particularly among the female voters in the suburban areas and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they disliked the president, often did not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony explaining in detail the sexual abuse of him by that future Supreme Court leader, analysts advised that there was a counterattack that followed if the Republican Party kept encouraging him to come forward with confirmation.
"This is becoming a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Party National Committee, early last week, to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee election or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans handle this issue and how they treat it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to vote for the Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be splitting up as to who to trust after the testimony from Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more favourable option to the latter.
A new poll YouGov conducted showed that 41 percent of respondents actually believed or might believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they actually believed or might believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh might or really lie during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After encouragement from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh who was drunk had assaulted him while he was 17.
Ramirez said that the future Supreme Court chief showed him his cock when they attended a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
Founder of World Wide Web Planning to Start a New Internet to Face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup trying to rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Irrupt, is a company built from Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to start now," he said from startup.
"This is a historic moment."
This app uses Solid technology that lets people create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
These stores may contain contact lists, task listings, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify which are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What's unique about this personal online data storage is that it's really up to the users who can access what kind of information.
In companies it is known as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of establishing an Inrupt, according to corporate CEO John Bruce, was for the company to present the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
It currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a volunteer community of codemakers.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications using tools available on Inrupt websites.
Berners-Lee said that she and her team did not talk to "Facebook and Google as to whether or not to introduce a total change in which all their business models would actually be reversed overnight.
"We didn't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt missions are to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet as he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the neutrality of network debate.
Even when launching the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic of the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorating the WW1 scholar Victoria Cross
The only Church scholar in England who won the Victoria Cross during the First World war as a warrior, was commemorated in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later she was killed by a sniper and never learned that she had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was inaugurated by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said this was a "symbol of intelligence" stone that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's achievement winning awards.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the de Saint-Quentin Canal "penetrating a very thick fog under a string of fire from field guns and engines."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with "the greatest courage" led the front line before rushing using field guns alone and crippling three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I knew that I would not be able to live but it was a very humble act."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to participate in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that many will give."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine this, you have stayed up all night watching an overcrowded Bellator 206 just to be denied the main event.
The bill from San Jose contained 13 bouts, including six on the main card and was being aired live all night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in England was made stunned when its coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some felt unappreciated after their stay up until the early morning special for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the turnover to children's cartoons as "an annoying joke."
"It is government regulation, that at 6 a.m. the content was not suitable for airing, so it was replaced with a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president of Bellator's marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they would improve their scheduling by taking into account future audiences in the UK.
"I think, if we think about the replay, I think we might be able to finish it," Coker said.
"But right now it's six in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to fix it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the turn, there were a lot of texts back and forth and everything was uneducated.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical mistake.
No, it's a government matter.
Trust me, next time it won't happen again.
We'll reduce by just five fights from six fights - as we normally do - and we'll try to avoid excessive screening for fans, and we'll be successful.
This is an unfortunate state."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'lowly' related to sexuality issues
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with a low self-esteem due to his sexuality problems - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he didn't realize it until he entered high school, that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said, she talked about the rights of homos to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him not so concerned about winning the Olympics.
The host who used to host this long - running event, Kirsty Young, was taking a few months off due to illness.
Showing up as people who were knocked out on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "less compared to" everyone else who grew up with her because "it's not a socially acceptable thing to like men and women."
He said: "To this day, the feeling is less than any other, and the feeling is different, has been the real things that gave me power and strength in order to succeed."
She wanted to prove that she was "something," she said, so she wouldn't disappoint everyone as they found out about her sexuality issues.
These two Olympic bronze medalists have become famous LGBT campaigners and used their performances at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
This three-time world champion said he was in love with a man - the filmmaker from U.S. Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley married an Oscar who was 20 years older than him last year, and he said age gap is not a problem.
"When you had so many problems at a very young age" - she attended her first Olympics at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced the same ups and downs.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than winning an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said her father couldn't accept that she was going to die, and one of the last things she asked was whether they had already gotten tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – because she wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'you won't sit in the frontmost row of fathers'," he said.
"I held her hand as she stopped breathing and still hadn't really stopped breathing until she died, I finally admitted that she was invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive before a crowd at the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had already fused with him in his preparations towards the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast broadcast on Sundays at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson changed roles when he was proposed to Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Mickelson would set a record on Sunday when he played his 47th Ryder Cup match, however he had to change roles to avoid unpleasant accomplishments.
Mickelson, who played in the two annual event to record a 12th record, was backed by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball game and group of four on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as he usually does for the United States, this five-time major winner splits his time between being a cheerleader and doing his game on that span, in the hope of fixing what had troubled him.
Never been the straightest golf batsman though while at the height of his career, this 48-year-old man was not fit to take a very tight course at Le Golf National, which routinely provided a lengthy and rough punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own pitch, not scary enough for Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faced highly accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who had teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four matches this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 singles games with four points below, starts with a hot start, then Mickelson's match proved to be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say so many other things.
"He really understands his role on this day, patting me on the back and embracing me, as well as saying he'll be ready for the match tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He was so confident.
He was Hall of Famer and he gave so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagine something else, but that's how it plays out and that's the way we think we should go.
He wanted to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson would pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup games, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in Ryder Cup which would never equal the height of his individual record.
Mickelson bagged 18 wins, 20 losses and seven series, although Furyk said his presence carried some things that could not be said on the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a cool guy in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players are having fun with him, this week too, which is fun enough to look at.
He gave a lot of things, more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knew great superiority could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, learns from experience that someone who leads big enough to his final singles match at Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane debuted his first in the 1997 game at Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point advantage over America, however had just touched the finish line with their nose by the thinnest margin, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get great advantage in Valderrama; we get great advantage in Brookline, where we lose, and in Valderrama, where we win, but just now," said Bjorn, taking pictures, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday by leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll enter a really boring match.
Come out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you get points on the board.
We have a target, and that target is winning this trophy, and that's the focus.
I have long said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are also well aware of what is on the other side - the greatest players in the world."
Glad to see the players playing on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "In this case I will never advance on my own.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players are going forward, and this is a different thing to do.
It's really nice to be out there with a colleague when things go well, but if you're out there playing individually, then your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
That's the message you have to convey to all players, taking out the best of yourself for tomorrow's match.
Now, you leave your colleague and he has to go to get the best out of her."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would ask his players to play better individually than they did as a yatawin, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself had been at both ends of the last day's turn that big game, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending in defeat as Europe performed "The Miracle at Medina."
"I remember every word of it," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players towards the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to start quickly as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When momentum goes one way, it will put a great deal of pressure on the middle match.
We also set up a roster and put people in a variety of ways that we felt, you know, we were trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas had been given the task of attempting to lead the resistance facing Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, the other European players being top.
"I went with a group of these people in this order because I thought I could close all the roads," Bjorn said regarding his single choice.
Germany's new warship was suspended again
The latest German Navy escorts should have begun duty in 2014 to replace an old Cold War-era warship, but it won't be there until at least next year because of the wrong system and the increased cost, local media reports.
The assignment of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class escort, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have already joined the Navy in 2014, but post delivery issues have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships already ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come in place of the elderly Bremen-class escort ship.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft flying missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as several stealth technologies, such as radar erasers, infrareds, and acoustic locks.
Other important features include a longer period of treatment - it should have been possible to use the latest escort ship for two years away from its home port.
However, the constant delay meant this sophisticated warship – which was said to allow the Germans to highlight its power abroad – would be obsolete by the time it began entering its time of duty, Die Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 escort ship had become a preaching last year, as the German Navy officially refused to assign the ship and returned her to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to shipbuilders after shipping.
Few reasons are known behind the ship's return, however German media cites an important number of "software and hardware defects" that render the battleship useless if used for battle missions.
Software defects were crucial because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on older Bremen-class warships.
It was also discovered that the weight of the ship was overwhelming that would reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add future updates.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" with this 7,000-ton weight is believed to be twice the weight of a ship with a similar class that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to the damaged hardware, the production costs of the entire project - including crew training - were also a problem.
It is said to rise surprisingly to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from initially €2.2 billion.
The issue that shackled this latest escort ship became crucial given the latest warning because of a shrinkage in the German naval force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee admitted that the Navy was actually "exhausting the ship with the ability to spread."
The official said over time the problem grew, as the old ships were no longer in use but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class escort ships could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the bat's secret life in secret
New research was being done on a plantation in the Scottish Highlands aimed at exposing how bats use the landscape in their hunting for food.
It is hoped that these findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano peetrelle as well as the long-eared brown bat and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in main locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct cellular surveys using handheld detectors.
Sound experts who analyze all recordings will ensure the frequency of the bat call and which species performs what activity.
Then maps and habitat reports will be made to create images on a landscape scale detailing about their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes this result will uncover which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits come from habitat management work such as grassland creation and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across England declined sharply in recent centuries.
These bats are threatened with development and development work affecting nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper hung to snare bats as well as chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Actually bats aren't blind.
However, because of his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes in terms of catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo location techniques to find insects precisely and barriers in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, cares deeply for bats.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections, and sometimes rescue efforts.
It has also established the first and only nature reserve in Scotland on the Threave plantations in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson said the plantation was suitable territory for bats.
"Here in Threave, we've got a nice area for bats," he said.
"We've got ancient buildings, lots of old trees, and all the nice habitat.
However, there's still a lot we don't know about bats yet, so, the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more and more about what they need to develop."
He emphasized the importance of checking bats before maintenance inside the property, as there was unwittingly the possibility of the destruction of one birthing nest could kill up to 400 female bats and a young one, which would probably wipe out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and killed, harassed, or disrupted, or destroyed their nests are illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bats Trust Conservation, has encouraged the general public to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species that we don't yet know what the fate of their population is."
Ronaldo who rejected the rape claim was preparing a lawyer to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claim on him a "fake news," and said that people "wanted to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer would sue German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
This Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was later alleged to have paid him by giving $375,000 in order to keep his mouth shut regarding this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram live video to 142 million of his followers a few hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
All they're saying today is fake news," this five-time Ballon d'Or winner said it to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers were preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they called a "report of suspicion in the unacceptable field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said it would ask for compensation as "a compensation of morale in the amount corresponding to the weight of the offence, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident was said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly returned to the player's room, a place where he is alleged to have raped her, according to a report filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga says Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was a disappointing "good guy" was just "one percent."
Documents say that Ronaldo justified that they both had sex, however it was on the basis of mutual desire.
Majorga also said she went to the police station and had committed a visum over her injuries at the hospital, however later agreed to resolve the matter outside the court because she felt "fear of getting retaliation" and feared "would be publicly humiliated."
This 34-year-old woman says now she is trying to undo the peace settlement because she is constantly experiencing trauma over the alleged incident.
Ronaldo had almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the assault being accused, and this summer he moved to Italian giant club Juve with a 100 million euros deal.
Brexit: England ‘will regret forever' for the loss of the automakers
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as a world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added "about" Toyota, England had told the BBC that if the UK quit the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily cease production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
That Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays if there was no deal, would cost Brexit in terms of job costs.
The factory in Burnaston - which made Auris and Avensis production of Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars in the past year which were 90% exported throughout the European Union.
"My opinion is if the British exit the European Union at the end of March, we will see a cessation of production at our plant," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British automobile manufacturers have expressed their concerns regarding his exit from the European Union without agreement on how cross-border trade will run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini factory in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem associated with what the automakers said was the risk of supply chains if there was no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production line was run based on the "timely" production principle, with parts coming in every 37 minutes both from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for cars made on order.
If the UK were to exit the European Union without agreement on March 29, there would probably be disruption at the border, which industry says could lead to tardiness and lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's supplies at its factory in Derbyshire, said the company's representatives, and thus production would be discontinued.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for relations with the future European Union was "calibrated appropriately to avoid checks on the border."
"We have to have a deal. we want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only enjoy success at this point, but for us to reach this opportunity," he told the Today programme of BBC Radio 4.
"It's not just from Toyota but other manufacturers as well, that we really should be able to continue what's already been a supply chain that's already going very well."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be halted, but that clearly in the long run, warned that the added cost would reduce the Saing power of the factory and would ultimately be detrimental in terms of the cost of employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who had worked at Burnaston for 24 years and was Unite's union steward at the factory, said his members were already growing concerned: "According to my experience, once this job is off, it will never come back again.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have submitted a proper and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may return pending, the White House said
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed back in a week" because the fight of future supreme court leader Brett Kavanaugh is still continuing, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in elections, relations among Trump and Russia's helpers, as well as potential obstructions of justice by the president.
Whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general or not, which would jeopardize Mueller's freedom, has sparked gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using a telegram to record conversations with Trump and possibly depose the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday last she went to the White House, amid reports that she would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "chosen not to" fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was again postponed to avoid clashing with a Senate justice committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, would both give testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, which went on to delay full Senate voting.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date for the meeting is not yet set, so in this week, I can see that reversing it to another week is good also considering the other things that happened in the grand court.
But we'll see and I've always wanted to deliver the latest news to the press."
Some journalists will oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the rarity of meetings was not due to the dislike to TV reporters "who are trying to attract attention," though, he said: "I disagree with the fact that they are trying to attract attention."
Then he proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be increased.
"The president did more direct question-answer sessions than the previous president," he added without mentioning the evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting will still take place, Sanders said, however "if the press has a chance to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it more often and you've seen us do it a lot in the past few weeks and it will replace the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump routinely asks questions while leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting high officials.
A solo press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably show you why, perform a free and sometimes bizarre performance before the press gathers.
The health secretary wrote a letter to European Union workers in NHS Scotland regarding concerns over the Brexit issue
The Secretary of Health has written a letter to European Union staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and hope they will still remain working here after the Brexit issue.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until the British withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to meet the cost of filing a steady status for citizens of the European Union working in the transferred public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union regarding this withdrawal are still continuing, approaching the expected decision this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for possible scenarios of no agreement.
I know this must be very disturbing for all of you.
That's why now I want to reaffirm how much I value the contribution of every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union, and others, brought valuable experiences and skills that strengthened and improved health care work, and benefited the patients and communities we served.
Scotland is really your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Underwent Emergency Operations After Had Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury to a 31-27 defeat of the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ of Tennesse reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the round was over.
"He came to the sidelines and fell unconscious there," Reed said.
Coaches and medics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further evaluation.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was already out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there has been no detail yet about the type/level of injury experienced" and the State of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this red-shirted sophomore, was in his first season with the State of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He earned a total of five teakels on Saturday before dropping out of the game, which made his total tekel during this season to 18 tekels.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher expenses when purchasing property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher costs when they buy property in England, along with extra money to help the homeless according to the new Tory plan
This move will withstand the success rate of the Corbyn movement in attracting young voters
This increase in cost will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Department estimates that it will collect up to £120 million a year- to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher customs as they buy property in England - along with extra money that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce it today.
This move will be seen as an attempt to withstand the success rate of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts in attracting young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high income.
The increase in cost will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, along with additional money that encourages the Government's efforts to combat vagrants.
The additional cost - which is an additional cost on the current cost of materai, including a higher level introduced two years ago on second home purchases and purchases of homes for rent - could reach three percent.
The Treasury Department expects this movement to go up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London were purchased by non-English residents, which led to price increases and made it increasingly difficult for the first buyer to set foot on residential steps.
Many of the country's wealthy areas - usually in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the multitude of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for a cost cut to help more young people own their first home.
He accused a large construction company of maintaining the property prices to stay high by buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to ignore quotas for affordable homes to improve the "unsustainable housing" in the UK.
Corbyn has announced a series of reform proposals in the field of attractive housing, including rent supervision and ending "no guilt" evictions.
He also wanted to give the council greater power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I promised I would dedicate the post of prime minister to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our derelict housing markets.
England will always be open to those who want to stay, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not appropriate for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to buy homes as easily as British residents who have already worked hard.
For many people the dream of having a home becomes something very far away, and indecent treatment of on vagrants remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My main assembly is leading the Scottish team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "main ambition" was to become Scottish manager at several stages.
This 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One, a three-point difference from the top position.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to defend my country as a player.
I get a B cap and that's him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I was great and often watched the Scottish team in Hampden with my father as a child, and it was always something that attracted me to return.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
This former Alloa Athletic boss said he did not feel dread following in the footsteps of big names at clubs of that size, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, current success will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Due to the existing structure and facilities at this club, there is no doubt to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to be there, but I would probably just see myself as the man who made it here, if I could bring this club back there."
Ross' career in team management was only three years, after some time as an assistant boss at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as a coaching staffer at Hearts.
Then she helped Alloa recover from degradation to third place, and turned St Mirren from the abyss of degradation into the championship title winner in the following season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"This may be the crossroads I have to go through," he recalled while taking over Alloa.
"I'm absolutely sure management is the right thing for me, more than play.
It does sound strange because I'm okay, making a living in a reasonable way, and enjoying some natural things.
But play can be difficult.
A lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still experiencing the pressure of work, but in management it feels fine.
I've always wanted to lead something and now I'm doing it, the most comfortable taste I've ever felt in my adult life."

Survey finds, the right time for a beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
Summer heat waves have increased pub-pub revenues in the UK that are struggling to survive, however more put pressure on the restaurant network.
The numbers show, pub groups and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but the income in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, the CGA's business consultant, who compiled the numbers, said: "The sun shines hot and British participation in the World Cup is longer than expected to mean, July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where pub revenue increases by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that get a hard hit.
The decline in the restaurant trade by 1.8 percent in June will get worse in July.
The sale of pubs and bars selling drinks has thus far performed most strongly compared to what happened to the downed restaurants.
Pubs selling food also suffer from the heat of the sun, although not as severe as restaurant operators.
Looks like people are just out drinking.
Sales across pubs and managed bars that sell beverages are up 6.6 percent for this month, with that selling food down three percent."
Paul Newman, RSM recreation and hospitality analyst said: "This result continues the trend we have seen since April.
The weather and impact of large social or sporting events remains the biggest factor that concerns outdoor market sales.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales over the years would be painful over the pressure the cost is taking place.
The long summer should not come at a time when operators selling food are having bad times, and time will tell if the good enough temperature we've enjoyed in August will give the little needed rest."
Total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a slowdown on the brand's launch.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
The survey revealed, one in five children - some of whom are still 11 years old - had secret social media accounts they were hiding from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the development of the page "Fake Palace"
This news has raised concerns about posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "primary" account to show to parents
One in five children - some of whom are still 11 - make social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid development of the "falseista" account - a reference to the photo sharing site on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they operate "primary" accounts that are already cleared to be shown to parents, while also having a personal account.
A mother who discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who asked someone else to "rape me."
Research conducted by the British Digital Awareness and the Men's Principal Conference" as well as the Headmistress" (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students had two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep personal accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It bothers so many teenage children who seek to create online space that parents and their teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of stewards.
Doyle was Scotland's most highly honored track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described this movement as a great opportunity for those leading the field of sports to benefit from his various experiences at international level over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we are confident athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by taking him on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for athletes and I hope to be able to actually contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
American athletic athletes, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre run at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic gold medals and are now this BBC expert, are now unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said that only time would determine if I could recover and to what degree his recovery would be.
It is a very tiring job to recover fully, to relearn how to walk, and to do today’s dexterity exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Breast pump ads that compare mother to cow have split opinions in the online world
Breast pump companies have split opinions in the online world with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product said to be "the world's first wearable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a humorous music video to show the freedom this new pump gives to express a mother.
Four moms danced in a barn containing cow straw following a song that included lyrics like this: "Yes, I blushed myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you don't notice it this isn't a tossed, these are my breasts."
Continued with the refrain: "Pump out, pump out, I feed them dear, pump out, pump out, I milk my woman."
However, advertisements that have been published on this company's Facebook page, have caused controversy online.
With 77,000 times seen and hundreds of comments, the video has received diverse reactions from viewers, with many saying this makes "drag" in the dairy processed industry.
"A very bad decision is using cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows also have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, unless the baby is stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.

Another comment: "An understandable trauma is good for mothers and infants.
But yes why not use it to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have to look after their babies?"
Others added: "A lost advertisement of meaning."
Someone else defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "funny."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still breastfeeding.
Blackmailing makes me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad was kind of crazy, but I accepted it for what it was.
It's a genius product," one wrote.
Others commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who squeeze (often at their workplaces or toilets) and who feel like "cows."
It's not an ad that's praising or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all feel dancing with hidden pumps tucked inside their bras.
The basic concept of this campaign comes from the insights of many women who squeeze breast milk who say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes and fitting inside the breastfeeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while extorting.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is a pioneer product worthy of launch by convincing and provocative.
By equating the picture between expressing women and milk cows we want to pump breast milk and all its challenging obstacles, and showing them by way of entertaining and fun with the full freedom presented by the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie's pumps have made headlines.
In the London show Fashion Week, a mother with two children performed on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved Quietly to Tent Camps on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children being detained is increasing even though monthly border crossings remain unchanged, partly as a result of the harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump government that make it difficult to raise children with sponsors.
Basically, most sponsors themselves are documentless immigrants, and fear endangering their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to save children.
Risks were increasing in June, as the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household had to hand over fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor abandoned minors.
The agency later ensured that 70 percent of those arrested had no record of a crime.
"Almost 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of sponsorship societies are in this country illegally, and most of them are evil foreigners.
That's why we keep hunting those people," Mr Albence said.
Aiming to process children faster, officials introduced a new rule requiring some of them to be present in court within a month of being detained, not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, the speech of shelter workers.
Most of them appear via video conference calls, not directly, to plead their legal status cases to immigration judges.
Those deemed unfit for help will be immediately deported.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are increasingly anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape attempts, the speech of shelter workers and systems reports received in recent months.
Lawyers said the concern was increasing in larger facilities such as Tornillo, whose signs were on a struggling child tended to be ignored, due to its size.
They speak that moving children to a camp town without providing enough time preparation for them emotionally or saying goodbye to his friends can exacerbate the trauma that has already been fought much.
Syria asks 'the occupying forces' from the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking in the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces occupied Syrian land illegally, on the grounds of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with properly."
"They must step down immediately and without filing any terms," he revealed to the assembly.
Moualem asserts that the "war on terror is almost complete" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with over millions fleeing their homes.
He asserts that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territory" of terror groups and "the illegal presence of foreign soldiers."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, particularly training and influencing Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in war - torn territory.
On the issue of the refugees, Moualem insisted they should return immediately, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading tremendous fear" that drove the refugees further away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politicized what was supposed to be a complete humanitarian issue."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until it was agreed a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel stronghold of Idlib has resulted in opportunities to continue political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented massive attacks from Russian-backed Syrian forces in that province, where there were three million people living.
But, Moualem asserted that the agreement had "a clear time gap" and led to the hope that military action would target mujahids including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "would be sacked."
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hoped to quickly call the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to create a post-war Act for Syria and pave the way to elections.
Moualem laid out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, asserting that panel work should be restricted "to reviewing the recent chapters of the Act," and warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to that logic, Trump will win the general election again in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators hope, prosecution and scandals end his presidency early on.
No one doubted, "The most dramatic end of the presidency ever!"
To this day, there is no sign of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's primary hour ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers of the main hour, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" had topped the cable TV ratings with 3.5 million viewers on headline nights.
"It's a spirit that attracts people because it's something that hasn't been understood yet," said Neal Baer, host of ABC's drama "Designated Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He is reminded of taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said that he would give Trump his vote.
Why? He asked.
"She said," 'Cause she made me laugh," "Miss Scovell told me.
There is the value of entertainment in a mess.
Certainly, unlike other TV shows, the storyline that emerged from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families could reunite and restore the global economy.
Switching from that, a luxury that only the most privileged audience can experience.
Nevertheless, it's not just being a knowledgeable citizen at six o'clock that you find yourself watching a panel of experts debate the use of Bob Woodward's "background" source for his book "Fear," wearing Paul Manafort's $15,000 ("a thick suit with vanity," reveal The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' horrific description of Trump's anatomy.
This time, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"The part of the policy he does makes it the same as a reality show that entertains you every night," said Brent Montgomery, Wheelhouse Entertainment's chief executive and creator of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's daily show scene and storyline players (choting hostile to the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

When I met Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was hiding while watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He was unable to free himself, not with Brett Kavanaugh being prepared to face the Senate Justice Committee and subsequently the Supreme Court according to his balance.
"I remember when we had all these crazy shows that day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

A lot of money from the outside flooded the most rigorous half-time election competition in the White House.
It is only natural for Pennsylvania 17 to gain a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of a congressional district that gave two losses in the same seat fight.
Pittsburg's recently reorganized district, filed Conor Lamb from Rep. Democrats - who won a seat in another district by-election special last spring.
Lamb advanced against another disaster, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which overlapped with the new Pennsylvania 17 district.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally siding with the Republican party.
The rivalry on Pennsylvania's new district 17 has resulted in large campaign funds between the major party's financial side, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in the March special election which was monitored generally for the 18 Pennsylvania Congressional District.
The seat had been occupied by Republican officials over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts sending Democrats is a little superior.
U.S. Weighing Up El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Retreating
The diplomats ensured that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, by putting little pressure on Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the management team of the Trump Organization.
State Department officials decided to retract the head of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, laid out in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, who had received about $140 million in aid from America in 2017, including for narcotics control, development support and the economy.
The proposed penalty, which includes trimming of financial aid and restrictions on targeted visas, will hurt the Central American state and rising unemployment rates and killings.
When internal meetings took place, North American and Central American officials delayed high-level conferences focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on the same meeting last year which was considered a step forward in order to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, high-ranking government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to continue, in order to effectively end consideration of punishment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech in the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal the government was performing at the meeting, revealing diplomats.
And the three American envoys quietly returned again to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing new reprimands or harsh punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate displayed by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations regarding these unclear circumstances.
Their statements were corroborated by outside analysts close to the government and also spoke of these unclear circumstances.
The Story of Studies
Another shocking story is Robert Mueller's special advisory report on the possibility of Mr. Trump's judicial barriers, which currently there is very important evidence in the public record.
Mr Mueller's report also discusses his investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our elections.
When Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable for himself, just as he's preparing to leave again in front of the voters, and may end up judging his partners.
That's why there's still so much to do, and I don't mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump's government is inevitable - or his equality in Europe.
There are choices that we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West fought him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed opportunities in avoiding the years of the subsequent massacre.
The beginnings of history centered along the point of such deviations, and an accelerated or postponed democratic march was inevitable.
Now Americans are facing some point of change.
What are we supposed to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested that secretly record the president and argued that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account wasn't true.
"How do we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's newly requested F.B.I. investigation is incomplete or fair - or if he's filed with the Supreme Court despite strong accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to vote at halftime for Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail that test, democracy will worsen for a long time.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once inhabited my embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with a swastika.
By leaving that legacy to me, how do I lose hope about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans was optimistic ahead of the game facing Rapid Vienna
The Rangers entertained Rapid Vienna on Thursday, stocking a victory over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, going on to strengthen their position to escape the European League G Group.
A knee injury left midfielder Graham Dorrans unable to perform in this first season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, however he was convinced the Rangers could utilize the result as a stepping stone towards greater hope.
"This point is really good for us because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old player.
"In this match we were sure we could get something and go by bagging one point.
In the end, we may be able to do so but, we think, the draw may be a fair result.
In the first half, they may perform better but in the second half, we got up and became a better team.
Stepping on Thursday, tonight becomes another great European day.
We were hoping to pocket three points even though it would be a tough match because they had good results in their last game, but, with the support of the supporters behind us, I'm sure we can keep going and get positive results.
In the last year, we had a hard time, because of what happened to my injury and the change in the club itself, but right now there is a very good hope in this club.
This squad is good and the kids are really enjoying it. It's a good exercise.
Hopefully now we can thrive, put the past behind us and achieve success."

Although surveyees have a clear idea of how they want to be treated, there are just not many people who discuss it with their family members.
Approximately half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of them say they're discussing this with their kids.
"They wanted family members to provide care, but there was no step whatsoever to start the discussion," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
This is where it starts.
Start talking to your spouse and children: you won't be able to prepare your own family for treatment if you don't tell them what you want first.
Discuss with your advisers and your family where and how you get treatment, because the one you choose will be essential in determining the cost.
Involve your financial adviser: Your advisor can certainly give you his help in showing you how to pay those costs.
The funding you choose for long-term care includes a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash insurance policy that guarantees these costs or insures yourself with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Show your legal documents: Face the legal debates that stand in the way.
Show immediate power for your health care, namely someone you trust to ensure your health care and guarantee that your wishes are carried out by professionals when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, a letter of power in regard to your finances should also be considered.
Someone who's trusted to take care of all your financial decisions, you have to choose, in addition to making sure you pay your bills in case you can't.
Keep in mind every detail as small as possible: Just imagine when your elderly parents are in emergency health and are on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer questions about both medication and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to answer.

A man was shot by an air rifle in Ilfracombe.
A man was shot with an air rifle on his way home from a night party.
The 40s victim was in the area of Oxford Grove, Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots hit her chest, stomach, and hands.
The event of the shooting was described by officers as occurring around 2:30 BST, and was said to be a "random act."
The victim did not see who attacked him.
The injuries sustained by the victim are not life-threatening and a number of witnesses have been filed by police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis hit Indonesia
An earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu, last Friday, where at least 384 lives were lost, officials were revealed, and the death toll was expected to increase.
The cutoff of communications made it difficult for the relief workers to obtain information from Donggala County, a region north of Palu city closer to the epicenter that struck at 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, after the disaster, over 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below a number of major facts regarding the towns of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the narrow end of the bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the quake and tsunami hit, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a district over 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline northwest of Sulawesi island.
It, which is an administrative area under the province, was estimated to have 299,200 in 2017.
The eye of the reliable economy in the province of South Sulawesi is to fish and grow crops, especially on the Donggala coast.
Nevertheless, the existence of nickel mining played an important role anyway in this province, although it was largely central in Morowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
Noted in the past 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis, based on data from the Indonesian Disaster Countermeasures Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in the tsunami and hundreds of homes in Donggala were destroyed.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami disaster in western Donggala.
Seismically, Indonesia lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire and hence earthquakes will occur regularly.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunamis that have hit the last few years are as follows:
In 2004: December 26, Indonesia was struck by a massive earthquake, just on the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, thus eliminating 226,000 lives along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, and more than half of the dead were in Aceh.
2005: Late in March and early in April, a series of also powerful quakes have hit the west coast of Sumatra.
On the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds were recorded dead.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most congested island, triggering a tsunami on the south coast and resulting in nearly 700 deaths.
2009: There was an earthquake with a strength of 7.6 near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
The death toll was over 1,100.
2010: One of the islands in the Mentawai archipelago, off Sumatra, was struck by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, triggering a 10 - foot - high tsunami that instantly devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya County, Aceh, also suffered a shallow earthquake and resulted in destruction, as well as panic from people who remembered the destruction caused by last 2004's deadly earthquake and tsunami.
Although this time did not have the potential for a tsunami, more than 100 people died because of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Lombok, nicknamed a tourist island, also experienced a major earthquake that killed over 500 people, where most on the northern side of the island.
The quake devastated thousands of buildings and temporarily spread thousands of tourists.
Son of Sulung Sarah Palin Arrested for Domestic Violence
Track Palin, eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on the pretext of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest attempts, as was the release of an Alaska State Police report on Saturday.
According to police reports, when an acquaintance of a woman tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she seized a phone call from the woman.
Palin was handed in the Mat-Su Pretrial Prisoners, with a $500 fine without bail, as reported by KTUU.
As news networks reported, Palin attended a trial on Saturday, declaring himself "innocent, as confident" when asked about his defense.
Palin faced three Class A misdemeanors, which could have him sentenced to one year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
In addition, she was also charged with Class B criminal charges, with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
For Palin, criminal charges this is not the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assault on his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, who called the police to make a report on the alleged assault.
Currently the case is filed with the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was prosecuted for domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence crimes, and possession of a firearm in a drunken state, which also related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received denunciation from a veteran group for associating her son with PTSD as a result of her duties in Iraq.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of victims died
On Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was struck by a severe earthquake until at least 384 victims died.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake that could have triggered a tsunami has devastated thousands of homes.
Power grids and communications lines are down, as well as the death toll is expected to continue to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake at that time struck central Sulawesi, which was northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos showing how powerful the moment of disaster is are circulating widely through social media.
Hundreds of people were gathering crowding out a beach festival in the Palu city at the time, when a tsunami broke up the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for suspected terror attacks in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York sought the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- the sentence included rare and has not been committed in the state related to federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, allegedly committed an assault by crashing a truck he rented from Home Depot into pedestrians and cyclists on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death sentence, the prosecutors had to provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" also caused serious bodily injury, based on a statement of the will to sentence him to death, which was filed to the Southern District of New York.
Based on court documents, then both indictments allow for a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury framed Saipov with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder in the act of extortion, which federal prosecutors usually use in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and attempted destruction of motor vehicles.
According to the prosecution, the attack required "substantial planning and early maturation," as an image of Saipov's crimes committed with "disgusted, cruel, and savage."
Expressed in a statement of the will, "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has resulted in injuries, dangers, and loss to the family as well as friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims at the incident were tourists of Argentine origin.
Counting a decade since the Southern District of New York dropped the death penalty last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, the murder defendant of two drug suppliers, was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The execution of the death penalty was last in New York federal court in 1953, handed down on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married couples found guilty in an espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed dead with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Based on court documents, Saipov, of Uzbekistan origin, showed no remorse as the day and month went on after the attack.
When asked by investigators, she said that she was happy with what she had done, revealing the police force.
Saipov revealed also to authorities that his attack was inspired by an ISIS video watched from his phone, as was the contents of the indictment.
He also requested that ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He found not guilty on 22 counts laid against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, expressed "clearly disappointed" against the prosecution's decision.
"According to us, the decision to execute death rather than accept a guilty plea for life imprisonment without bail of release would only extend the trauma of those involved in the incident," Patton described.
Earlier, Saipov's defense team had pleaded with prosecutors not to sentence them to death.
NIGEL FARAGE was responsible for the Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for a 'movement of the people's army' today in protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should 'feel the heat' of Eurosceptics - because one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested participating in negotiations with the EU.
Supporters of the conservative group, Peter Bone, told road action in Birmingham that the British 'should be out' today if only Farage served as Brexit Secretary.
Nevertheless, the challenges facing May in the reconciliation of her divided position have been underlined by supporters of Remain Tories who joined separate protests denouncing Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan to stay in his path despite the attacks on the Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union.
Allied nations stressed that he would be encouraged to move forward to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite his poor reaction - and force Eurosceptics and Labor to have to decide the choice between his proposed package and 'the chaos'.
Bone told a mass of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that she wanted to 'get rid of Chequers.
His proposal, that Farage should appoint associates to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If his charge remained him, we'd be out by now," he said.
Wellingborough Members of Parliament pitched additionally: "I am ready to stand in favor of Brexit, yet we need to get rid of Chequers."
Reveal it, as it shows its contradiction to the European Union: "We do not fight in a world war in order to become submissive.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.'
Bone dismissed the proposal that public opinion could potentially lead to change since the 2016 vote: "The gaze that states that British people's thinking has changed and wants fixed conditions, it's not at all true."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns who was also in the mob action, presented to reporters: 'Simplely, I would like to say: O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers were unpopular in general, whereas the Opposition would not vote for him, on account of being unpopular with the party and our activists who earnestly went down the street and got us elected first.
Our plea, get rid of Chequers and start listening to us.'
Through a message addressed to May, it added: "The Prime Minister retains their work when their promise is kept."
Farage said that demonstrations of politicians had to be rallyed in order to 'feel the heat' if they wanted to renege on the 2016 referendum decision.
‘The most valuable moment is the trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he expressed.
'They tried to deny Brexit and here we are today, asserting to them that 'we will not get you out of it'.
He added in a message to the enthusiastic public: 'I want you to make our political class, who are preparing to deny Brexit, also feel the heat.
‘We are moving the people's army of this country that will win us in Brexit and will never give up until the realized United Kingdom is self-governing, self-government, and proud.'
Meanwhile, the Remainers mob moved through Birmingham before staging an action downtown for two hours.
The activist row appears to be flying the Tories Against Brexit banner after sparking its lineup this weekend.
A partner in the Labour row, Lord Adonis, ridiculed the Conservative group regarding the security issue of their party application as the conference opened.
‘It was these people who told us that they could master the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for the sake of an anti-scratching border, in order to trade unrestricted free in Ireland,' it turned out.
‘What a joke show.
There's no good Brexit at all,' it turned out.
Warren's planning a serious run-in in the presidential nomination.
United States Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she will "rather the presidential nomination" after the election moment in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic party declared its future at city hall in western Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently denounced President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against state GOP representative Geoff Diehl, Trump's 2016 deputy campaign chairman in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, she was already marked as opposed to Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, held with the city hall format since Trump took office.
A participant asked him questions, whether there were plans to run for president.
Warren answered, that it was the right time for women to enter Washington's circle to recover our broken government, and that included the time when women topped."
Caught the shooter Sims, an LSU player.
On Saturday, Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced the arrest of the suspected shooter to the point of causing the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested at 11 a.m. in an ET press conference.
They released a video of a shooting on Friday, in which a man was identified as asking for help as seen on tape.
Friday morning, Sims, 20, was shot and found dead near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died," said police chief, Murphy J. Paul, to media on Saturday, through 247sports.
Wayde then wanted to protect his friend and Simpson opened fire on him.
While interrogated, Simpson claimed he was indeed on the scene of the crime, wielding a firearm, and fired it at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested unopposed and sent into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot 6-inch junior player, growing up in Baton Rouge, that's the Sims figure, having played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 ball bounces in each game.
The Grand Prix event in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after the team conceded his victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear by the time Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in the qualifying event on Saturday that would bring the Mercedes team orders had a great role in the race.
From pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton because she maintained her position at the first two turns and pulled Vettel to attack her teammates.
Vettel became the first to drive into the pits and allow Hamilton to move in in density at the end of the crowd, something that should have been very decisive.
Mercedes went in the pit one lap after and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to drive after some chase action that showed the reluctance of Ferrari drivers leaving the inside blank at the risk of holding out after a double move to hold out in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the start in the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead in most races because he held off a tire change to target a quick completion and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth.
He eventually got into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to improve his pace at the remaining eight laps as finally Raikkonen took fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man let me.
The team has done a tremendous job of having one two," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday through his insistence, she did not divulge a letter from Christine Blasey Ford regarding the sexual assault of future Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement delivered by Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, instead of commenting on what was going on in the senate showing people who were "evil and obscene and dishonest."
"Something can happen and beautiful is happening over the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and obscene and dishonest," he said.
"When you see a break-in and a leak and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the documents - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we leak...No, we didn't leak it," he added, as the senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and it had leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein refuted the leak did not come from his office.
"I'm not hiding the allegations of Dr. Ford's, I'm not leaking his story," Feinstein said against the committee, delivered Hill.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as secret as he requested."
But his rejection seemed disapproved of by the president, who remarked during a rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's really a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the future Supreme Judge, who became accused of sexual abuse of three women, the president was impressed with assuming Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power in various ways.
You see crime, obscenity, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to walk in order to achieve power and oversight," the Mediaite reported on the president's speech.

Air Traffic Drivers Died to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers On Plane Survived Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after his death while ensuring the plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
Over 800 people have died and many others disappeared after a major earthquake struck the Sulawesi islands on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
A continuous strong aftershock rocked the region and many were trapped in ruins in the town of Palu .
But even though his colleagues fled for their safety, 21-year-old man Anthonius Gunawan the Great refused to leave his post in a hard shaking guide tower at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He chose to hold on to ensure Batik Air Flight number 6321 which at the time was on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumps from a traffic control tower as he feels the tower is starting to collapse.
He died afterwards in the hospital.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Aviation Navigation Services Society, Yohannes Sirait, delivered his decision to save hundreds of lives, reports from the Australian ABC news.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Borneo to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached the hammer.
"We are all saddened to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities concerned the death toll could reach thousands after the National Agency of Disaster Countermeasures delivered access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong difficult.
"The casualties are believed to still continue to grow because many of the bodies of the victims are still covered in ruins and many others are unattainable," said national body spokesman for the disaster relief Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves reaching six meters have melted the hammer down which led to a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes brought aid and various supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother delivered to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
Clean water becomes scarce.
Minimarkets everywhere looted"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, delivered to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Palang worked hard to help the survivors but we didn't know what they would find there.
It has been a tragedy, but it can probably get worse"
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the entire evacuation-related task.
Ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia earlier this year was also struck by an earthquake in Lombok that killed over 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini delivers one missing person after lagoon plane crash
The air airline operated a flight that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia delivering one person had disappeared, after it had been delivered to 47 passengers and the crew had been evacuated safely from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini delivered in a release on Saturday afternoon, his party unable to identify a male passenger.
The airline said its side had been working with local authorities, hospitals and examiners to find the man.
The airline did not quickly respond to requests for more detail regarding the passenger, such as his age or citizenship.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew, after the plane struck the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline relayed the remaining six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the complete sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. naval parties both declared the aircraft landed in the lagoon around the runway.
Some eyewitnesses feel the plane is beyond the runway.
American citizen passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
"That's really something good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to wade through waist-high water through the emergency exit on the sinking aircraft.
He delivers the flight attendants frantically and screaming, and he suffers a slight head wound.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working close around the repaired docks also helped rescue using rubber boats to transport people ashore before the aircraft sank at a depth of about 30 metres (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Aviation Security Network indicates 111 people have died in a PNG-egistrated airline crash over the past two decades but none involving Air Niugini.
Analysts exposed the timeline of the woman of the night who was burned alive
Prosecution charges that took place on Saturday in a re-examination of a man accused of burning alive against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made an outline for the jury as to how he used cell phone footage to collect the various movements the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, made on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that show Tellis was at one location with Chambers the night of his death, rather than reverse the defendant's previous statement, rumored to be Clarion Ledger.
When data indicated the defendant's cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford followed the trial on Saturday and she testified that she was not in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth as he said that he was in a Sanford truck the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies delivered by Tellis was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks until the victim's death.
Cell phone records indicate they knew each other within a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, sometimes Tellis erased messages, calls and contacts Chambers' information from his phone.
"He removed the victim from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge stated he hoped the trial would lead to a jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of hip hop trios wanted to challenge the genre's negative views by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who is from Bristol, claimed the hip hop movement away from the origin of political messages and ran into social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make the hip hop spirit popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK through several artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?!
NY nanny sues partner for assault after issuing a "racialist" message
A New York nanny sued one couple for discriminatory assault after receiving an indirect message from a complaining mother and claiming she was "another black person."
The couple refused if they were considered racialists, and considered it more like "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed concern when she realized that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day at work in 2016.
"TIDAAAAKKKK KKK ANOTHER BLACK," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Anyway, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
Upon realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, stating that they had issued a nanny, who was an African-American mixed citizen, for having done an ugly job and he was more expecting Filipinos, based on the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home using Uber.
Now, Maurice is demanding that the couple compensate for the dismissal, and ask for compensation of about $350 a day for a period of six months, in exchange for the job of the nanny that he had to do at first, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, see, you can't do something like that," he told the Post on Sunday, then added "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple countered claims claiming they were racialists, stating Maurice's fired workers were a reasonable thing to do, they feared they could not believe it after alluding to it,
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racialist.
We're not racialists,", Joel Plasco's husband said to the Post.
"But will you allow your children to be cared for by someone you have abused, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As wrapped in "extortion," said Plasco his wife had just two months given birth to her baby and was in "a very difficult situation."
"You're going after someone in that condition?
That's not a good thing to do," investment banker added.
While legal cases are still underway, public opinion justices have made quick recognition of the couple on social media, blaming for their attitudes and logic.
Paddington's publisher worried readers wouldn't be related to talking bears, new newspapers revealed
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born not far after her book had been received, was explained in the letter. "It's very difficult to just talk without knowing the position she was in, reading it first before it was published.
It's funny knowing as we know about Paddington's great success."
Said her father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspiring through child book writing with bear toys, who were very optimistic of her work that had been rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the book's publication that was flavored "sweetly bitter" after her father's death last year .
To Paddington, who he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father was quite proud of the end of his success.
"He's a pretty quiet guy, and he's not a snob," she said.
"But since Paddington means so much to him, it's like you have a child who has achieved something: you're proud of them even though it's not your whole endeavor.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was a result of his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her over the phone.
By the time it had already landed, her daughter was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors failed to rescue her.
"Nad made the call calmly to deliver it was so bad. that he was likely not to survive," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad stating he was going to die within the next two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors have given to keep his heart beating are slowly running out and leaving his system behind.
He's been dead for a while now handling the process and everything feels deadly.
I can just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can't groan, or scream or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold it all back."
Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently grieving the loss of her daughter, boards a plane along with the other passengers - unaware of what she has been through.
"No one knows it," he said.
"My head is down languid and my tears keep dripping all the time.
It's very difficult to explain, but while on that flight I felt such deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her."
The grieving women posted cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones tried to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspiring messages and numbers that can be contacted for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when she began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel as I do every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son is a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knows him by his smile.
They always say that her smile brightens the mood."
But, she stopped working before she died, like she was "there in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I constantly worry that there will be ongoing effects."
Mrs. Davis made the cards, "to tell people that there are others out there that you can approach and talk to, even if they are a friend.
Don't sit there and shut up - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who befriended Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, her spouse for 15 years, shortly after her mother died.
"He didn't say if he was feeling sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed there was a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day - as the kids opened their presents he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said his death was a major trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "It made a pit in the family.
It separates us.
But we had to get through it and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future was in uncertainty when the FBI began its investigation.
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking – a timed, restricted investigation of his coverage – we may be able to bring a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "destroyed" amid a stalemate of the council's ruling.
Why doesn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans want the FBI to investigate?
Their rejection is all due to time.
The legislative elections are five weeks away, on November 6th - if, as expected, Republicans do it badly, they will become very weak in their chance to get the person they want elected to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush has contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI filed the report?
There will be an election in the Senate, in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear if Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes among the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors ‘collapse' under Kim
The number of people who defected from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, said a Korean Partition MP.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern United Ministry data, said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the border controls between North Korea and China and the higher rates picked up by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang gave no public comment.
Most defectors from the North were ultimately offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says over 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most blur through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return home.
Relations between the North and South - which are technically still in the war - have greatly increased in recent months.
Early this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on pending denuclearization negotiations.
This occurred after a historic meeting in June between United States president Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a broad sense to work together regarding the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of development since.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in the situation, there is no way we will drop our weapons unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accused Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical," saying he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
Opposition Party Chairman Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said he was not temperamentally fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I cannot avoid the thought that if a woman of her performance were like that, they would say ‘hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that she had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, several times almost screaming and having trouble talking when discussing regarding his family and his years during high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, saying the allegations against him were "unreasonable and coordinated character killings" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi says he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't serve in the Supreme Court because he's biased towards Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi expressed objections if she would try to indict if she was approved, and if Democrats gained more votes in the People's House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if he hadn't told Congress or the FBI the truth, then he wasn't fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the courts where he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential ruling against the Health Services Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as an adherent of conservative justice.
In an appointment hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not time for someone hysterical and biased to go up to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
And women need to handle it.
It was an ethical insult, anger for months and years, and he couldn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry,: Miss Steinem says to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, what do you think?"
He continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person who was talking to her, "You probably think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he went on.
And I think it's brilliant."
Tears were issued as a solution to anger partly because he was essentially misunderstood.
One of my most powerful memories of early work, in a man-dominated office, one time I cried with inexpressible anger, was my neck gripped by an older woman—a cold manager I've always been a bit afraid of—who dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they think they made it."
Patricia Schroeder, a congressman from Colorado, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair outside of marriage on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned the election, Miss Schroeder, was frustrated, understanding that there was no reason for herself not to run for president.
"That's not a carefully thought decision," he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was too late in the campaign, he was left behind in the fundraiser, and so he vowed he would not contest the election unless he managed to raise 2 million dollars.
It was a fight that led to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the man only gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he wondered.
As he gave a speech announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overpowered by emotions – gratitude to those who supported him, frustration with a system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger towards sexism – made it difficult for him to speak.
"You'd probably think that I was too nervous," Miss Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write on my headstone?
"He's crying?""
How the U.S.-Tongkok trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening shot of trade competition between the U.S. and China was so desperate, and when the fight was far from over, the crackdown between the two countries might have been profitable for Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese export goods including solar, steel and aluminum panels.
A very significant rise was imposed as of this week at a new rate affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) goods, effectively enacting a tax of half of all goods coming into the U.S. through China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, recently imposed rates to five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pleaded to equal the US one-by-one, and the world's second largest economy will not change in the near future.
Telling Washington to step down means following will, but publicly yielding to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards appropriately, U.S. trade competition pressure can favour China positively in the long run by reducing dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could make conditions that spark economic movement in both countries is actually more dangerous than what observers had previously known," said Abigail Grace, a research fellow focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert agency.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of the refugees, according to the Foreign Secretary
Syria said that they were ready for the return of volunteer refugees and offered help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in his country improved.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and safe thanks to progress in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government went on to rehabilitate areas that terrorists destroyed to restore it to its original state.
All conditions are now present because of the voluntary return of refugees to a country they have to leave because of terrorism and a thorough economic decision that makes their daily lives and their livelihood a target.
The United Nations estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have been displaced from their countries since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not accept the help or conditional aid of countries who supported the rebellion.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the Ryder Cup defeating the U.S. Team by a final score of 16.5 and 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its trophy as the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who attempted almost throughout the tournament, hit his tee punch into the water on a 16th-hole par-3, conceding his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golf athlete Molinari shined along his rounds, becoming 1 in 4 players who have ever got 5-0-0 since the format in effect in the tournament began in 1979.
American athlete Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest-ranking player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top order player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who might have played in his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia of Spain became a European with an overall win with career points of 25.5 at this tournament.
"I don't usually cry but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the trophy back.
It's about the team., and I'm glad I can help," Garcia said who was emotional after the European victory.
He gave his responsibilities to his fellow countryman John Ram who defeated legendary U.S. golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"The amazing pride I felt, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record .
Statistics are bizarre by one of the best players of all time, having won 14 major titels only under Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to get fairway with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after the performance let his team down, "I'm proud of these guys, they fight.
There was a time this morning when we were making Europe difficult.
We had a fight.
Salute Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll reconstitute, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll step forward.
I love these 12 people and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to pay your respects.
We're losing the lead."
