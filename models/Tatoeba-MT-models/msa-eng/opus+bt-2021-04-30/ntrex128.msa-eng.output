Councillor (AM) Wales is worried 'looks like a doll'
There was concern among some AMs over their title proposals to be changed to MWP (Members of Parliament Wales).
It arose because of a plan to change the name of the conference to Wales Parliament.
AM's entire political spectrum worries it can invite scorn.
An AM of the Labour Party said, his party cares ‘he rhymes with ‘Twp' and ‘Pwp'.'
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, ‘twp' means ‘mad' and ‘pwp' means ‘natured.'
AM from Plaid said, his party as a whole was 'unhappy' and had suggested an alternative.
A Conservative of Wales said his party was ‘open-minded' about the name change, but stated he was a brief oral leap from MWP to Doll.
In this context, the letter ‘w' in Wales is called the same as the Yorkshire English term for the letter ‘u.'
The council's commission, which was drafting the law to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any reviewer called the Councillor must be a matter for the members themselves."
The 2017 Wales Royal Act authorized the council of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission notified the results of a public negotiation that received extensive support to call the council as Parliament of Wales.
Regarding AM titles, the Commission favored Members of Parliament of Wales or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in public negotiations.
AM seems to suggest an alternative option, but it's problematic to reach an agreement and could upset the head of Honorary Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft of the law regarding changes within a few weeks.
The law on renewal of the entry of other changes according to the way the ceremony works, including rules regarding the loss of AM credentials and the design of the committee system.
AM will get a final vote on what to call it when they discuss the law.
Macedonia made a vote in the referendum on renaming the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to ‘North Republic of Macedonia.'
A popular vote was set up in an effort to settle a few decades of disputes with neighboring Greece, which had its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long asserted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly denied its membership offer for the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who voted against the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was just a price to pay to join the EU and NATO unions.
St. Martin's Bell was silent because the churches were grumbling in Harlem
"The old man I met said, according to history, there are bars and churches on every corner of the street," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, both are gone."
He said losing the bar was understandable.
"People are socializing in different ways these days," he said.
"The bar is no longer the living room in the neighborhood where people will always go."
For the church, he's worried the money from the sale of assets won't last as long as the leader expects it, "and eventually they'll be back where they started."
The churches, he said, could be replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums inhabited by people who don't want to help keep the sanctuary still in the neighborhood.
"The majority of the people who are going to buy condos in this building are white people," he said, "and therefore are going to get these churches shut down altogether because there's no way that most people who enter these condos are going to be members of churches."
Both churches were built by the whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
Jemaah of Methodist origin moved in the 1930s.
The black sheep who had been worshipping nearby had taken possession of the building.
St. Martin has been taken over by the blacks under the Honored John Howard Johnson, who led a sales boycott at 125th Street, a major street for shopping in Harlem, which opposes taking or promoting blacks in employment.
The fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Pastor Johnson made plans to rebuild, they ordered the tower bell.
David Johnson, son and successor to Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly referred to the tower bell as ‘the bells of the poor.'
The expert who played the carilone in July called it something else: ‘Khazanah culture' and ‘the historical instrument that cannot be replaced.'
Expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first bell in the world to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played at St Martin's for the past few months has become a hassle to architects and contractors, some brought by church leaders, others by Episcopal bishops.
The chamber of Vestri--the congregational administration, made up of public leaders--described the bishop in July with concern the bishop "will strive to pass the cost" for the chamber of vestry, although the chamber of the vestry was not involved in the taking of the architect and contractor brought in by the bishop.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Sharks hurt 13-year-olds while diving for coral shrimp in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13 - year - old boy on Saturday when he was diving for coral shrimp in California on the opening day of the coral season, said officials.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing along with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a fun scream catching the reef shrimp, but he "realized that the kid was screaming, "I got bit!
I've been bit!"
His entire collarbone was torn open and opened," Hammel said he noticed when he found the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!"" added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that sharks were found in the area a few weeks ago, but it was confirmed to be a harmless shark species.
Giles added a trauma wound to the top of his body.
Officials are shutting down coast access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for purposes of investigation and safety.
Giles claims that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's design to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury took Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams from a beauty style room in a versatile building controlled by an expert maid.
As part of the hard work of entering the £2.8 billion beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow while fashion sales and home appliances return, a larger beauty room will be tested in 11 buildings across the country and taken to more buildings next year if it comes to success.
The investment in beauty comes when the supermarket finds ways to use the shelf space that used to be charged with TV, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury said she would double her beauty offer size to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Multiple existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the same branded parts as those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched Boutique's various makeup products to make the majority of its products vegan-friendly - something that young buyers are increasingly asking for.
In addition, perfumed oil trader Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury fair markets, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, late this year.
Shopping online and turning towards buying a little food every day at a local convenience store means the supermarket has to work harder to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, executive chief of Sainsbury, said the branch would look like a multi-purpose building since the market chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl's big business with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury put the Argos branch in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several places since it bought both chains two years ago, said to have increased grocery sales and made earnings more profitable.
The previous supermarket wanted to modify the beauty and pharmaceutical parts that ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested the Boot effort in early 2000, but the partnership ended after a debate on how to split the income from the pharmaceutical store in his supermarket.
A new strategy came about after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical store businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmaceutical chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds played a part in the show, adding a variety of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four buildings.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury commercials, said: "We have changed the look and appearance in our beauty room to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested with specially trained friends to offer advice.
Our various brands are designed to meet every need, and the interesting environment and comfortable location means that we are now a fascinating beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'the beaver' after Holly Willoughby withdrew an offer of £11 million
Peter Jones, star of Dragons' Den, 'the beaver' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrew a £11 million deal with her lifestyle branding business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for house items and accessories from Truly Brand.
The couple's business was likened to that of Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning provider, 37, uses Instagram to announce that she will quit.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones, in a fit of rage by withdrawing from the lucrative lifestyle branding business at the last minute - to focus on his extraordinary new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones ‘the beaver' when the successful TV woman admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer – worth up to £1.5 million – meant she had no time to devote home goods and accessories from Truly brand.
The business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's worth £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his vacation homes.
Sources say: "All along, Truly was Holly's priority.
It will be his long-term future that can watch him through the next few decades.
The decision to pull out everyone involved was really surprising.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow's headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe the departure of this Morning operator, who is one of the most acceptable stars in a bank in Britain, could cost the firm millions due to a large investment in products consisting of cushions and candles up to clothing and household goods, and potentially to suspend its launch.
And it could be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children and husband of Dan Baldwin has been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, accompanied him as chairman in Mac.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin, a TV publishing firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV's attorney on I'm A Celebrity' program.
Sources close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business dealings."
Firm conversation 'and then we fell in love'
He joked about the criticism that the news media would receive for making a review that would partly consider ‘unseemly to the president' and very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said by encrusting the voice of ‘newsreaders.'
"I never give up."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June was crowned by Trump as a big step towards the stop of North Korea's nuclear program.
But negotiation of nuclear program stops is delayed.
More than three months after Jun's summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations Grand Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see "a similar response" from the United States about the early North Korean armistice movement.
On the contrary, he said, the U.S. continues its restrictions on maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his meeting speech.
"Our relationship is good with North Korea," he said.
"We are going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to repair relations with Kim had brought positive results - ending rocket tests, helping to free hostages, and bringing the bodies of American soldiers back to their homeland.
And he maintained his extraordinary approach in talking about a relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this solid arena, we'll have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing out the crowd in front of him directly.
Indonesian Tsunamis and Earthquakes Destroying Islands, Killing Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, the non - foreign government said that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, as a condition for international aid.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they clearly don't ask for international help, so it's quite challenging," said Ms. Sumbu.
While Save the Children were together on a team going to the Hammer, it was uncertain whether foreign personnel could work at the scene.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Based on the earthquakes that Indonesia has faced frequently, the country remains unwilling to face natural disasters.
Although a tsunami shelter was built in Aceh, it's no ordinary sight on the other coast.
The shortage of tsunami sirens in the Hammer, even though the warnings are in effect, is like contributing to the loss of life.
At the best of times, travel between the islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the quake was heading to Palu, but it took at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made poor infrastructure improvements a major issue in his election campaign, and he's given high allocation to highways and railroads.
But lack of funds has hit Jokowi's administration because he's dealing with the election again next year.
Jokowi faces pressure rather than mazhab tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majorities members have accepted a more conservative understanding of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes because Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, and other weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player, Daniel Sturridge equalised against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Prime League by netting a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal with his team ahead 1-0.
He kicked the ball to the left before punting towards a distant goal net.
The attempt soared high above goal when he hovered towards the top right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball fell over Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always carry the ball as far away as possible, so I tried to buy as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come in and make a kick and don't think long and then make a shot at it."
Chelsea took 1-0 at halftime after getting networked in the 25th minute from Belgium's star, Eden Hazard.
The Blues' attacker sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before bouncing in midfield and running into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic gives and delivers can quickly in the middle.
He then unleashed a beautiful kick, bringing Hazard into goal.
Danger passes defense and scores away goals with a left foot kick past Liverpool player Alisson Becke.
Liverpool fought Napoli in the Champions League rankings at 3pm Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faced Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths caused by earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, said the country's disaster agency early on Sunday morning.
A lot of people are reported to be trapped under the collapsed building in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit Friday and triggered a 20-foot wave, a spokesman for the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency told a press conference.
The pallu airport, which had over 380,000 people, was filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32 years old, for suspected murder after a woman stabbed to death
The murder investigation was made after a female body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab marks at Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested for murder.
Police have urged the crowd in the area to see or hear anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The situation is still at an early stage but I beg anyone who is around John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious in order to contact us.
I also beg anyone, especially the taxi driver, who may have recorded something on the board camera futej to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed the woman found the body was a local Birkenhead and she was found inside her house.
In the evening, friends who believed they knew the woman had arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police say the investigation is under way, they're in the process of informing the heirs of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment but was told by the police no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He became bitter when he found out what was going on.
Residents were told the investigation took hours until they were allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He kept repeating "it was so terrible."

The statue of Cromwell Parliament became a recent memorial plagued by 'rewriting history'
Its elimination will be poetic justice for the destruction of its Taliban with so much artefact culture and English religion carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as ‘stupid' and ‘tried to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the discussion now concerning the removal of the statues to which the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
Iconoclasm of the English civil war was either not ordered or run by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestors in the past century.
The beautiful representative of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft against Cromwell is 19th-century evidence and part of the history of the man who many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was regarded as crowded, more populous at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, in his situation certainly the monarchy.
Whether it is a full representation becomes the subject of an ongoing historical discussion.
What's certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped our country's next development, and Cromwell is a person known as a figure representing a divided section.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also well-received and commemorated."
Pigs Beat Chinese Farmers to Death
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified by his surname "Yuan," was found dead with severed arteries, covered in blood near a market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou region of South China Morning Post reporting Sunday.
A pig farmer prepared to inject a vaccine into a pig on May 30, 2005, in Xining Qinghai County, China.
He is reported to have wandered with his cousin from the Yunnan region on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and found a pig door next to open.
He said in the pigsty was a big pig of a man with a bloody mouth.
Forensics confirmed that the 550-pound pig beat the farmer to death, according to the report.
"his family" Wu," said, as picked by Guiyang's Evening News.
Security footage shows Yuan entering the shop at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed the pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed that man doesn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One market manager told the Night News that pigs had been locked up to stop him from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reported to be making compensation negotiations for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon farmers were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not always aggressive but the taste of blood could act as "pences."
They're just playing.
They're nipper, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to pay the right amount of respect,' he said.
More of Rosa’s hurricanes brought extensive rains to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa was weakening as she moved into the cool water waters of Mexico’s northern shore.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains north of Mexico and southwest of the U.S. on the coming day.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, Category 1 storm, until 5 a.m. east Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough that began to form in the Pacific Ocean and moved east towards the U.S. West Coast when Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she began to resist the tropical north southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture interacts with the approaching trough that creates heavy rain in the Southwest the following day.
Within the country, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, splinter streams and soil collapses possibly in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rain levels to near 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
A total of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially more than Arizona.
Flash floods may be in bad shape due to tropical rain distributions.
He was strongly advised to plunge into the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause canyons for the river to rage and thunderstorms that will bring the country strong winds and dust to blow.
The nearing Trench will bring heavy rains on the shores of Southern California.
The amount of rain over half an inch may occur, which could cause a stream of small splinters and slippery streets.
This became the first rain in the region in the dry season.
Some tropical rains will begin near Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become further late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
On October it can see some intense changes in temperature across the U.S. when the Arctic gets colder, but the tropical area remains a little warmer.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes with short distance temperatures.
There's a great example of a temperature difference through the U.S. center on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the warmth of the summer will continue to try to build and expand again.
Most U.S. centers and east are expected to witness a warm start to October with 80s extending from the Plains South to the Northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which estimates 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance of temperatures above average for eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people witnessed the shocking testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of being sexually assaulted was charged in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political standoff continues, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for a last minute touch Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh groped him and tried to undress him at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his statement, says 100 percent is definitely not the case.
It's probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers are not available immediately for other networks indicating PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching in the office.
To put in perspective, it's the size of an audience equal to a football game or an Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, which thinks the host has endorsed Kavanaugh's appointment, heads all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers while listening throughout the day, says Nielsen.
ABC is second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen says.
Fates stay high after listening.
Flake is the main character in this Friday's play.
After a simple Republican office issued a statement he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested as a CNN camera and CBS on Friday morning was yelled at by the protesters as he tried to board the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
He was standing with less effort for a few minutes while he was preaching, live on CNN.
"I stand here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power when many women don't have power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, he would say a lot on the hearing of the committee.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered the clock live later, when the Committee of Justice voted to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would see the charges against the naming next week, an urgent minority democrat.
Flake believes he was part of a conversation with his partner, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons.
After the Coons and some senators' conversation after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice does have power, because it's clear Republicans won't have a vote to pass Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused the critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for Conservative Participatory Conference in Birmingham, Britain, 29 September 2018.
In another interview along with him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister, Boris Johnson emphasized his said attack as Checkers for Brexit, saying Britain and EU's reserves should collect tariffs of each "completely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooter: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson with the death of LSU player
Police have arrested the suspect in shooting dead Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed in prison on a two-degree murder charge, says Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he claimed Wayde shot physically to death.
The bill has been set at $350,000, D.A.'s report.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's office issued a report early on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
This department credits the Louisiana State Police's wanted officer team, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police and the area residents in aid of the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for "sufficiency and justice effort".
Sims is 20 years old.
Six-foot-six grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 increases last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "great" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about all the time," Wade said said.
Volcanoes exploding in Mexico City
Dust spewed from the Popocatepetl volcano all the way to the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and it registered 183 releases of gas and dust for 24 hours.
This center monitors various tremors and quakes.
Images on social media show thin layers of car windshields covered in ash in residential areas of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity in the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake rocked Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police encounter with the followers of Catalan's understanding towards the anniversary of independence voted
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a pro-liberated protester ran into a riot police, and thousands joined demonstrations to signify the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization election.
A group of masked pro-separators held by riot police threw them with eggs and released paint powder, making dark clouds in the streets that travelers used to come to.
The struggle also took place later with the police using their staffs to fight.
A few hours later the pro-liberated group chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness" face-to-face with a unionist protester who shouted, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in protest, local media reported.
Tensions remained high in the area of independence a year after the October 1 vote was characterized as illegal by Madrid but welcomed by the Catalans' separation.
The voters choose their sense of freedom, even though the percentage of votes is low with those who oppose segregation, most of them boycott lots.
According to the Catalan authorities nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop the election taking place at polling stations across the region in a violent battle.
Pro-liberation group camped yesterday on Friday to prevent demonstrations supporting state police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separation protest with his wife said he no longer hoped for the prospect of Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we went through one of our best moments of life.
I saw my parents crying with joy at being able to vote but now we're stuck," she said.
While management is crucial if it comes to victory in the nominal election last December, Catalan pro-liberate parties have fought to maintain the momentum of this year with well-known leaders who are both in exile or in custody to await trial for their role in organizing a referendum and a declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded protests against police support on her phone, saying the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison before the trial since the end of last year, announced he will compete in the European Parliament elections next year.
"To compete as a candidate for the European election is the best way to condemn regression in the democratic values and oppression we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man detained after house run over by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the same car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Detective Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the doors and the building itself.
Cross Whirl A may also have opened fire on the train at one time.
Menger's attack gave Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly's first goal Gives up for Livingston earns victory
Livingston's rise shocked Rangers to hand Steven Gerrard over to a second defeat in 18 resistance as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly's attack proved different when Gary Holt's team moved in with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team remains winless in the Premiership this season and face the head of Hearts, which they will trail with eight points next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston lengthened the run unbeaten in this section to six games, with coach Holt still feeling the defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a chance against the other side.
Holt's team was supposed to be way ahead before scoring, with their involvement causing the Rangers any trouble.
Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his attempt past goal, but Alan Lithgow could only give up his efforts after lengthening to Craig Halkett's horn.
The host is eager to let the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they can trouble the opposing party with a set cut.
And that's the way in which important goals exist.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston opened the curtain, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set Menga, who took the touch and goal network from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers have taken possession but have found a home defense that cannot penetrate Liam Kelly's goalkeeper Liam Kelly's largely no problem.
The pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos insisted on rescuing Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow netted goals from one more Livingston match.
Crosses went straight into Livingston's box and kept cleaning, while two penalty demands - after Halkett's substitute Glenn Middleton's challenge, and one for a handball - bounced away.
'The Phenomenon' of Livingston - analysis

His outstanding achievements and results were for Livingston.
To men, they were brilliant, continuing beyond expectations on this ascending trajectory.
The style of the game and their staff has been virtually unchanged since returning to the top level, but large credits have been forced to go to Holt for him to launch the team since he came.
He has many heroes.
Captain Halkett is extremely brave, manifesting a superbly regular defense, while Menga keeps Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over the toes.
Rangers lack inspiration, though.
Good as they sometimes are under Gerrard, they fall away from that standard.
The last ball was quite lacking - just once they cut off the home team- and it was a call for the awake Rangers, who found themselves at the mid-table.
Erdoğan received numerous responses in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdoğan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at repairing relations with NATO allies.
They talked about issues including human rights, freedom of press and Turkish inclusion into the EU.
Erdoğan then heads to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
It is the home of Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to keep the people 25,000 strong from gathering in front of the mosque, but many nearby supporters wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – most of them Kurds – also made their voices heard, condemning both the basis of Erdoğan and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The war resistance described the happiness of a visitor who was hailed as a hero by some Turks and fired as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: Bicycler dies in car collision
The cyclist died in a crash involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, south-east of the airport, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The incident occurred a few months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police say the officer is trying to identify the man and inform his heir.
Road closures and bus diversions in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disorder
Six prison officials were injured in disorder at a high-security male prison, said the Prison Office.
A disturbance occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at approximately 9:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
Officer "Tornado" was brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involved eight occupants and had one wing.
Officers have been treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "The soldiers of the well-trained prison have been assigned to deal with the happenings taking place at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and obviously they're responsible for referring to the police and can spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June he was reported the governor of the prison receiving hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officials were called to prison to deal with a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With a Flash Flood
It's rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what might happen next week when Hurricane Rosa's wind power track crosses Desert Southwest, the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa was expected to take her way up Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late yesterday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet only "ten tropical tornadoes remain storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest model of the National Typhoon Center predicted 2 to 4 inches of rain to fall, with a remote amount of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of Desert Southwest include the center of the Rockies and the Great Basin will probably get 1 to 2 inches, with a remote amount of so that it may be 4 inches.
For them, from the risk of a flash flood, Rosa may rain grace from the time the region is dry.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some rain will benefit since the Southwest is now in a state of drought.
According to U.S. Monitoring, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from the worst drought, the second highest category, "reported by weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to the mainland on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, having hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north by 12 miles an hour.
The storm faced cold waters in the Pacific and therefore generated a descent.
So it's expected the ground collapsed in Mexico on the strength of a tropical storm in the evening or evening on Monday.
Rain across all parts of Mexico could be heavy, causing a huge flood risk.
"The amount of rain 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, so it's probably 10 inches," reported by weather.com.
Rosa will track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then will track through Arizona and south of Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The ultimate expected danger of Rosa or debris is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and desert U.S. Southwest," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to produce life - threatening flash floods and debris in the desert, and the ground collapses in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found injured in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, approximately 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a stable state.
A 17 - year - old man, two 18 - year - old and a 20-year - old man was arrested yesterday in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officers are begging who may have cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh 'suffered, meaningless, angry' Democratic Party
"Undian Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the cruel and outrageous tactics at the Democratic Parties," said Trump at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia..
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered a very bad, angry" Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, emphatically and emotionally denying the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford he sexually assaulted in the decade while they were teenagers.
Ford also testified to hearing about his allegations.
The Tresident said on Saturday "the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage" Kavanaugh on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds at the moment, a lawman who has a brilliant record in public service," he told the public who supported West Virginia.
The President simultaneously referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of Republican elections at elections.
"Five more weeks, one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm in a fighting spot for a great candidate."
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "disregard and obstruct."
The first major procedure vote in the Senate on the naming of Kavanaugh was expected not to be late than Friday, the leadership of the GOP's right-hand assistant told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, tsunamis, with toll rates rising
At least 384 people were killed, many were swept away by giant waves crashing on the beach, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in Palu city on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) crashed ashore at dusk, sweeping many deaths and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami followed the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the threat of a tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and not running and they ended up falling prey to, "Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster arrest agency BNPB said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged a car, balak, home, it attacked its smua on land," said Nugroho while adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before it hit the edge.
Some people climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people have been moved to 24 centres in Paluu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The shaking of the end continues to rock the city by the shore on Saturday.
Several aftershocks were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Research and Application Agency says in one statement that the energy released by last Friday's earthquake was about 200 times more than the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city located at the end of a long, narrow bay may have increased the size of the tsunami wave, says the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as ‘extending' and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He said that the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the building collapse and that another 540 people were injured and 29 people are still missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and destruction may be greater along a coastline 300 miles (190 km) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is near the epicenter.
"Communications are completely disconnected without any information' from Donggala," Nugroho said.
"About 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross Army in one reality by adding that their staff and volunteers were heading to the affected area.
"It's a tragedy but it could be even worse," said the Red Cross.
The agency was severely criticized last Saturday for not informing us that a tsunami hit Palu despite officials saying that the tsunami occurred within the warning period.
In an amateur video that's turned on social media, there's a man on top of the building screaming at people on the street about a tsunami.
Within minutes, a tsunami wave swept the coast and pulled together buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the authenticity of the videotape.
The quake and tsunami caused a massive power leak that cut off communications around the Hammer and it made it difficult for authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military had sent aid by cargo plane from Jakarta and other cities but many more residents were in need of food and other basic necessities, authorities said.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's Tsunami Death Rate Increased To 800 People.
It's really bad.
When the World Vision staff from Donggala had safely reached Palu city, they went through the scene of the disaster, and workers took refuge under the tarpaulins set up in the front yard of their office in Palu, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's a very bad situation.
Although relief forces began to provide disaster relief in the dark, some say foreign aid workers with deep experience were prevented from heading to the Hammer.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supply of materials and shipping workers from overseas can only be run if disaster areas are declared a disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the region stage," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross Force.
"When the government says "OK, this is a country disaster," then we can receive help from abroad but for now there is no status."
When the second night came in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami last Friday, the friends and families of the missing victims hoped that their loved ones would be a miracle that appeared and cheered them up from feeling sad.
On Saturday, a boy was found in a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued the victim of a woman trapped under a rock for two days with her mother's body next door.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian team of skaters has trained two skaters who were lost to the quake for the Asian Games which had ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi said.
"As a senior in the field of skaters, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told how he was seriously sending WhatsApp messages to the skaters in Palu who joined the beach festival after several hours of news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel scattered among the skaters' community.
The sent message has only one gray rait mark compared to the two blue rait marks.
"I guess the message didn't reach," he said.
The thief robbed $26,750 while recharging ATM money at Newport on the Levee
The thief robbed $26,750 of Brink's employees who filled in the Newport on the Levee ATM last Friday, according to a news release by the Newport Police Department.
Brink's employees emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and were ready to send in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink’s employees were busy doing their job, a man ‘ran to his back’ and stole a bag full of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene based on the report, but police did not state how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information on the thief should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rap singer changed his name to Ye
Rap singer Kanye West changed her name - to Ye.
Announcing his name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "This man is officially known as Kanye West."
Kanye West, 41, was called Ye for a while and he used that nickname as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The conversion occurred during his appearance on the Saturday Night Live show where he was expected to launch Yandhi's latest album.
"She replaced singer Ariana Grande who cancelled her appearance in the show over ‘emotion issues,'" said the design's creator.
Before this, Kanye West said that the name has religious significance and also stands for his current professional name.
"I believe ‘ye' is a common word often found in the Bible and it means ‘you,'" said Kanye West earlier this year when discussing his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So am I you. I am we. We are we.
It turns from Kanye meaning only one, to Ye - an image of the reflection of our good, our vices and mistakes and all.
The album is more of a reflection of our own true image."
He was one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year he announced that he preferred under the names Love and Brother Love.
Kanye West's former co-operation partner JAY-Z can also accept it without or with a dash and capital letter.
President of Mexico, AMLO has vowed not to use military action against civilians.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military action against the public as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of a bloody tragedy retaliation against the student.
AMLO pledged at Plaza Tlatelolco on Saturday to "never use an army to curb Mexicans."
The military opened fire on a civilian who had a peaceful demonstration on the plaza on October 2, 1968, which left 300 civilians dead during the left-hand student movement beginning in Latin America.
AMLO vowed to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to become involved in criminal gangs.
The United States should be doubling artificial intelligence funds.
"The United States should double the amount of funding in the field of artificial intelligence because China is becoming increasingly active in that field," said investors and inventors of Kai-Fu Lee's artificial intelligence who have worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view was expressed after the U.S. government made an announcement about artificial intelligence even though the United States itself as a whole lacked the official strategy of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year by aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovations ahead of 2030.
"Multipling the allocation of artificial intelligence research is a good start since all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to achieve our next success in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"By doubling the funds could increase the next great chance of artificial intelligence achievement (AI) in the United States," Lee said in a CNBC interview this week.
Lee's book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order' was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO of Synnovation Ventures who invested in one of China's most famous companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that defeated American Othello players who were in the best position while still studying at Carnegie Mellon University, and then he became an executive at Microsoft Research and the president of China's Google branch.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's previous technology competition as a Robot challenge from the Defense Research Project Agency and wanted to know when the next competition will be held so that he can identify new talents.
"Investigators in the United States usually have to work hard in order to win government aid," Lee said.
"It is not China that takes academic leaders but corporate enterprises," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have appointed great talents from universities to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said a change in immigration policy could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to PhD graduates in artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued a forward generational artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
"The Chinese State Science Foundation provides funds to people at academic institutions, which equals the way the State Science Foundation and other government organizations divide funds to U.S. researchers but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center aimed at gathering partners from industry and academies, the White House announced a select committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF also invests over $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. bill that's trying to establish a National Security Commission for Make-Intelligence has not been carried out in the past few months.
The people of Macedonia voted to change the name of the country.
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday to determine the conversion of the name to ‘Republic of North Macedonia'. An act that would settle the dispute with Greece that had persisted for a decade in which Greece had prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty (NATO).
Greece, which has its own territory, Macedonia, insists that the name ‘Macedonia' represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed to resist the inclusion of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments came to an agreement on the proposed name change in June but nationalist dissidents said the exchange demeaned the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority of its inhabitants was Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the vote and that the nomination raises doubts as to whether the vote will reach the minimum of 50 percent of the vote required in order for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper says, "Do you agree to join NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change included Prime Minister Zoran Zaev saying "The acceptance of the new name is a price worth paying to join the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia so that they could live freely under the European Union because that meant our lives were safer," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
Although not legal, the members of the parliament said that they would comply with the vote to make it final.
Changing the name requires two thirds of the majority in parliament.
The state's election commission said there were no reports of anything that didn't go according to the rules from one p.m.
However, the attendance vote was 16 percent over 34 percent in the 2016 parliamentary election after 66 percent of voters registered to cast lots.
"I've come to vote because of my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko cast a ballot in Macedonia for the exchange of the country's name which will pave the way to Macedonia to join NATO and EU in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was setting up a small stage and putting the chairs before the tent erected by the men who boycotted the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to accompany it with pride and not in this way," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor citizens but we have dignity.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn towards China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said the participation in NATO would give Macedonia a sufficient investment where the unemployment rate exceeded 20 percent.
I believe the great majority will accept because more than 80 percent of our population voted for EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting the vote.
He said the ‘yes' result was ‘an assertion of our future.'
A vote was published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Police Studies which says between 30 and 43 percent of the voters will take part in the vote - below the required amount.
Another vote, run by Macedonian TV Telma, found as many as 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, as many as 70 percent said they'd vote yes.
For a vote it's a success the number of voters coming in must be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure in voting will be considered the first serious slap to pro-Western royal police since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City does navigation through the entire Brighton defensive line to get a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent off as Brighton's defensemen at Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at Stadium Etihad in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look very easy on his network in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a shipment in the center of the field at the start of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenses, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He turned down a defenceman before chasing several more men on the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he pushed the shipment to the left, looking for Sterling.
The English forward uses his first touch in the box to send back the ball to Aguero, who uses his right boot to beat goalkeeper Brighton Mathew Ryan by one kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is grappling with his leg problems," City Pep Guardiola manager told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Prime League match.
The goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area at the match.
He made a pretty pass ball pass through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling towards a distant position.
The Sky Blues forwards soccer into the network before sliding out of bounds.
City fought Hoffenheim in a collection of Champion League plays at 12:55 noon on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play only against the Rockies.
With the Nationals knocked out of the game, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the very helpless Scherzer hopes to face the fort on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are run out play implications for the Rockies, who hold one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies embrace at least a special opportunity spot with 5-2 wins over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock down their first part champion.
"Even though we're just playing, at least we can know the mood in Denver with people and other teams will play at the highest level that I'm about to face this year.
Why don't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals still have not announced a novice for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to justify Scherzer making a throw in this situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, holds a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw his usual Sunday break.
The driver who used the right-handed from Washington was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 punches just in 220 2/3 inning this season.
Trump Meeting in West Virginia
The President does not directly refer to the situation surrounding the High Court elect Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the number of Republicans coming at the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to face the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not competing but I'm very competing and that's because I'm in all places fighting for a great candidate," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this awful group of Democratic radicals, you see it happening right now.
And they are eager to take power back by any means necessary, you see cruelty, evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to hit to gain power and control.
Democrats, he said, were on a mission to ‘reject and stop.'
"And you saw that for the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats ‘angry, evil and untrue.'
He referred Senator of the Justice Committee to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who has received a strong boo from the audience.
"Remember his answer?
Did you leak the documents?
Uh, uh, what.
No, I'm waiting for one - it's a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen"
Labor is no longer a vast church.
It is not tolerable for anyone who speaks out their views.
When Momentum activists at a local party I vote to identify me, it's not surprising.
After all, my latest in the AP Labour line was told that we were not welcome - all for speaking out our views
My parliamentary friend Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment as she supported the anti-yakudi.
In my case, the censure movement has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interests of economic policy, about national security, about Europe, which is ironically the same issue as what Jeremy disagreed with the former leaders.
Notice a meeting for the Nottingham East Labour party on Friday said that "we want a meeting that includes all and productive."
For almost eight years I've been a local AP Labor, the GC meeting on Friday night really covers all that.
Sadly today, it is not the tone for many meetings and political promises ‘better, gentler' has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It becomes more evident that the difference of views is unacceptable in the Labour party and each opinion will be judged whether it is accepted by party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as a previous colleague, I thought sharing almost the same political views began expecting me to make a U round and take a position that I would not agree to—either on national security or a single EU market.
When I speak outside - and no matter what I say - then it will be followed by denunciations of abuse on social media, told not to vote, denounce political centers, order me out of the Labour party.
And it wasn't just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm luckier than my colleagues because comments against me are more political.
I was amazed by the professional attitude and persistence of my fellow workers who had been bathed in sexist and racist curses every day but never gave up.
One aspect of the political disappointment of this era is how the degree of abuse has become accustomed.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour party cultivate cultural tolerance.
The fact is we are no longer a broad church and with every ‘no-believe' proposal or change in election rules, the party becomes increasingly narrow.
I received a lot of advice two years ago urging me to keep quiet, not to be too prominent and then I would ‘be good.'
But that's not why I entered politics.
Since I was a member of Labor 32 years ago as a student of the school, raised by the neglect of Thatcher’s government, who let my entire class be destroyed, I have tried to make a better public service for those in need — whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including on the off-selection.
No one in Nottingham East could possibly be confused about my position and the conflicting division with the leadership right now.
To those who support the motion on Friday, what I want to say is that when the state rejects Brexit, it will explain the contents of our home, business and public services, I don't understand the feeling of wasting time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour party.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my voter, whether the Laborers or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise you the unelected threat or the appropriateness of politics doesn't prevent me from acting in what I believe is in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unmatchable Ayr climbs to the top
Two slow tries may make a skewed final decision, but no doubt Ayr deserves success in this exciting and entertaining Premiership Tennent match.
They are now at the top of the schedule, the only one who has never lost to 10 men.
Finally, their superior defense, as much as they took the opportunity, made Peter Murchie's home team and coach happy.
"We've been tested on our game so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Praise be to Ayr, they take better chances than we do."
Grant Anderson conducted an experiment in the 14th minute, a conversion by Frazier Climo, putting Ayr ahead, but, a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, issued for a match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to create a network and Jason Baggot captured an unconversioned try.
Climo ahead of Ayr with a penalty, before, at half the time, he got the point then a solo conversion attempt to make 17-5 to Ayr at recess.
But Melrose started second well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the chasm to five points.
There was a long delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken out, and from the beginning, Ayr went straight ahead again through the trials of Stafford McDowall, the conversion by Climo.
The replacement captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose countered the extra player with an unconverted try of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a time of fierce pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card due to Climo's unballed take, from the outside of the penalty line, MacPherson was a little behind hit by the forward Ayr.
Climo conversion, as he did almost as it began, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent away Gregor Henry's flanker for the fifth attempt of the home team.
The star Still Game was seen ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran was seen to be ready to move into the hospitalization industry after he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis on a famous BBC show, where he wrote and starred with old comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple had announced that the ninth series to come was the last on the show, and it appears that Kiernan was planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to the official record report, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun's sources cast a shadow that Kiernan wanted to involve in ‘the growing restaurant business.'

Throughout mainland Bolivia, the memory of losing shore to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still clear - like one yearning to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is probably the highest in the century, since Bolivia is still awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1st after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and certainly hopes for a positive outlook," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will side with Bolivia's demands - after centuries of talk - Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign exit into the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversy match for the next year's re-election - is also of much interest in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a decision that sided with Bolivia - and if it happens a little bit much will change.
The U.N. Agency in the Netherlands does not have the power to give up territory to Chile, and has decreed that it will not decide for possible discussion.
Regarding the decision of the ICJ which would come out just after six months the final argument was heard suggesting the case was "uncomplicated," said Paz Zárate, Chile's international legal expert.
And not to delay the Bolivian foundation any longer, for the last four years there may be obstacles.
"The issue for the entrance to the sea has been seized by Bolivian administration now," Zárate said.
Morales' rhetorical hostility had reduced Chile's compassion a little bit of it, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at one time continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to have a discussion after this.
Both countries haven't changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in Hague, rejected the idea of making court decisions usually quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to open new era relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop the 139 years of fighting for the greater good," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America - used maritime issues as political aid.
"Bolivia never gave up on her right to get a direct route to the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we need to forget the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons will not happen unless it trusts the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country wouldn't do their nuclear weapons first if he didn't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the Great United Nations Assembly.
He asked the United States to carry out promises made during the summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came about because U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to want to restart nuclear diplomacy which ceased more than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri said it was ‘just a dream' that the ongoing ban and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is careful to agree to a declaration without Pyongyang once making an important action of gun massing.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is as serious about launching a weapon which is seen as the only way to ensure the safety of his country.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit hearing.
The Paris Fession Show introduced the latest design of a large headpiece on its way to the main road near you.
If you want to add a collection of your hats or block sunlight completely, then you don't have to look far.
Valentino and Thom Browne's designers revealed a variety of oddly sized headpieces for their SS19 collection on a show stage that garnered a fashion set on Paris Fession Sunday.
The impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and the designers have sent their designs to the show.
A notable design by Valentino is that the water - yellow great hat is decorated with a thick artificial feather that broadly covers the head of the model.
Other large accessories include pottery decorated with gems, smart hats and even pineapples - but it's not designed to make your head hot.
Thom Browne also revealed the choice of a strange mask - and the perfect time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have been sewn on his lips and more worn by Hannibal Lecter than a graceful dress.
One design resembles a scuba diving device equipped with snorkels and gogals, while the other looks like a liquid ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the big fashion statement--you're lucky.
Watchers predict that a very large bonnet may be heading to the main road next to you.
The large, warm hat of 'La Bomba', the two-foot-wide straw hat has been seen wearing everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label king behind the highly impractical hat had featured in social media sending another large design to the straw beach - bag theater almost as large as the model covered in the bathing suit it wore.
The bag of burnt orange rafia, decorated with rafia edged and coupled with white holders, which is prominent in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in the Paris Fesen Week.
Celebrity style expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to be able to see a big hat and a beach bag arrive on the main road for the coming summer – because the designers have made a very large and difficult impact to let demand for a large accessory."
John Edward: Language skills are vital to global citizens
The private schools of Scotland maintain a record of performance for academic brilliance, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of brilliant exam results, reinforced by individuals and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students all over Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Society (SCIS), strives to provide services at the best level to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students for higher studies, careers of choice, and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that they can and carry out an earlier school curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be well known and the subject of choice is wanted within the school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it will get into his head.
If you speak to him in his native tongue it will enter his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can't just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exam, we can see that language is the top subject in the league table with the highest pass rate in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages got higher A's.
This data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, shows 72 percent of students getting higher A's in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them studying German, 69 percent of them learning French and 63 percent learning Spanish also getting A's.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Language is now, as a subject of choice, being held just as is the subject of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
Research by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found the reasons employers struggle to fill vacancy, 17 percent linked to lack of language skills.
That is why, again and again, language skills become a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities in need of language, this skill is very important in this global world.
Whatever career one chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have the real advantage in the future by having a lifetime skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country will put someone who knows many languages automatically ahead of competition.
According to YouGov's vote of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough for conversation, with French as a conversational language spoken only by two-digit percentages, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language today is important for children these days.
Having multiple languages, especially the country is building its economy, will complete children with better opportunities in finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the language they learn.
Some schools will focus on more modern languages, while others will teach a language that is seen as vital to the UK when they look forward in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there are often many languages that can be chosen from within a private school, with an expert teaching force in that section.
The private schools of Scotland are dedicated to providing an atmosphere of learning that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It's undeniable at this time, in a global business environment, that language continues to be very important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern language should be considered ‘the skill of international communication.'
Private schools will continue to offer this option, variety and brilliance for the young in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Council of Private Schools of Scotland
LeBron will make the first appearance of the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for a fan who wants to see LeBron James make his first start for the Lakers of Los Angeles.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening match before the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes will he play yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell says that James may be playing in a limited minute.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a table of six games prior to the Lakers season.
"I don't need a game before the season to be ready at this stage of my career," he said.
Trump Meeting Time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a hasty rally campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five Trump meetings scheduled next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote of confirmation withheld for him to vote to meet the vacancy in Federal Court, Trump was aiming to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans risked losing control of Congress when the vote was decided in Nov.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's meeting at Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET on this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online via stream live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be handling this week's trial for Federal Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is becoming tensed over the prosecution of sexual misconduct with the confirmation of the Senate vote that is expected to be held for a week during the FBI investigation.
But the primary target of this hasty gathering is to help Republicans gain momentum in the face of November's elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign says the five meetings in the next week are to "enforce volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and develop the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so critical for his agenda that the president will go to as much of our inner state as possible towards a busy campaign season," Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month Trump has visited West Virginia, the country he won over 40 percent of the points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is following him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey until the president has to come to support him," said Simon Haeder, political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team shows courage to fight in ensuring hope still exists heading to the individual match on Sunday
After the three-party match, the corner game on Saturday afternoon was probably what the Ryder Cup needed this time.
Momentum swinging is the concept of a sport that is a creation but it is truly believed by the player, and especially in a match like this.
So where would that momentum be right now?
"They had an advantage of six points and now it's four eyes, so we brought a little momentum, I guess," said Jordan Spieth as he walked at the end of the day.
Europe certainly has the advantage, four eyes ahead with twelve more points to take.
American players, as Spieth said, felt they had little advantage and a sense of encouragement, not just from Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and had three out of four eyes.
Spieth displayed venomous games from start to green and set an example for other players.
The cheering grew louder as he continued to march, doing an important glue shot to match the four eyes when he and Thomas were left behind after two points.
The stroke that gave them the victory on the 15th hole was greeted with the same cheer, which tells you that he believes the Americans are still fighting.
"You just have to try harder and worry about your own matches," Spieth said.
That's all there is to all these players right now.
18 holes to show power.
Only two players with more eyes than Spieth and Thomas since two days ago are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the story of an indisputable Ryder Cup.
A pair of different role models from Europe, who love four eyes out of four, and don't seem to make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple that didn't do the bogies on Saturday afternoon, but they also dodged the bogies on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The period and the way their energy is given and demonstrated by supporters is that they are players to be defeated on Sundays, and there is no more popular player to block the possibility of a European victory at sunset in Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best both of them in different holes.
However, the conversation about winning the European team was too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it easier for Sergio Garcia, the hero of four players this morning, when he was in league with Alex Noren.
One bogi and two doubles in the first nine holes to raise the Spanish player and the Swedish player.
However, on Sunday, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are interesting to watch more closely because of the interaction between couples, the advice given and not given and the strategy that can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team so far and ahead on the last day but this fourth session also showed the U.S. Army had the courage that many had previously doubted, including local fans.
European team ahead 10-6 to the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe brought a comfortable advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after rising from a four-ball match and four players with 10-6 points over the United States.
Both great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari were ahead with two wins over Tiger Woods who were struggling to bring their wins at Le Golf National to four eyes.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn attempted to maintain the captured trophy at Hazeltine two years ago, taking control of the wrongful American team in the four-ball morning session, with a 3-1 series of eyes.
The U.S. team gave more competition in game four players, won two matches, but couldn't close the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 points out of 12 points in an individual Sunday match to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first new European player to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend were the second couple to win four points out of their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then jointly defeated Woods and American new player, Bryson Dechambeau in a 5&4 match.
Woods, who went through two tough matches on Saturday, exhibited brilliance but has now lost in 19 out of 29 four-ball matches and four players and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not play a rest during the four-ball morning session, re-joined Henrik Stenson in a four-player match to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 – taking place one and three in the world.
Europe had no luck on a quiet, relaxed day in southwestern Paris.
A three-time major championship winner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became the gauge wood for America with two points on Saturday.
They earned a 2&1 win defeating Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and then again defeating Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4&3 match in a game of four players who were killed in the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did a four-point team go into the individual match, even as the Furyk Army's defending champions need only a tie to maintain the trophy.
After taking the second place for two days, the Sunday counterattack seemed out of reach.
North Korea says 'no way' they'll disarm voluntarily without trust
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday, the continuing ban has caused their deep distrust of the United States and it is unlikely that his country will release nuclear weapons voluntarily in the situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual Grand Assembly of the world body, North Korea has taken important steps in the past year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missiles, closing nuclear test sites and promising not to expand the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't see any appropriate response from the US," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there would be no confidence in the safety of our country and under such circumstances, there is no way we would have disarmed ourselves in the first place."
Although Ri reprimanded the complaint against North Korea about Washington's opposition to the "staged" approach to the end of the nucleure in which North Korea would be rewarded because it took a vehement step, in fact it seemed important because it did not resist voluntary rejection as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit hearing between the president of the United States and North Korean leaders in Singapore on 12 Jun, when Kim promised to strive for a "nuclear end of the Korean peninsula" while Trump granted assurances to North Korea's safety.
North Korea was trying to find an end to the Korean War of 1950–1953, but the United States said that Pyongyang should release his nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to follow advice to loosen international restrictions on North Korea.
"The U.S. asserts "first-time termination" and increases the pressure level within the restriction to reach their goals by force, and even opposes "the declaration of war's end," Ri said.
"The perception that the partition could weaken us was the empty dream of those who did not know us.
But the problem is that the continuing partition is further worsening our distrust."
Ri didn't mention the plan for the second summit hearing between Kim and Trump that the leader of the United States of America held during a United Nations conference earlier this week.
The minister mentioned only three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party in this issue of the end were South Korea and not the U.S., the nuclear end of the Korean peninsula would not have found a standoff."
However, Ri's tone differs dramatically from last year's, when he told the U.N. Supreme Assembly that targeting large U.S. land with North Korean rockets was inevitable after Trump's "Evil President" named Kim a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year in a United Nations trial, Trump, who last year threatened to "destroy completely" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said a lot of work still needed to be done and the partition needed to remain until North Korea ended its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are arguing that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the partition of the Security Council must proceed vigorously and without fail until we feel the complete end of the nuke, final and confirmed."
The Security Council has been unanimously raising restrictions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dismantle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo meets Ri outside the United Nations Grand Assembly and says after that he will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit hearing.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours of it had condemned him for making "ganglike demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to reveal missile sites as well as nuclear complexes if the United States took "the appropriate steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "same measures" Kim was looking for were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and was heading towards a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard students have taken courses to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all of its students more sleep in an effort to combat a learning culture that's getting worse through caffeine-based 'all night.'
A teaching force finds students in the world's number one university often unable to understand the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, provided the course he believed was the first such in the United States.
He got inspired to begin the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation during his study.
'At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said: ‘Why am I only being told about this now, in my senior year?'
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep—and that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students the need for good sleep habits to help with academic and sporting achievements, and improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university health service said, the university decided to introduce the course after finding the students were sleep deprived all week.
That one-hour course involves several interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm room, where students click cups of coffee, curtains, coaches and books to be told about caffeine and light effects and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of sleep routines.
In other parts, participants are told how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Campus maps with interactive icons, then encouraging attendees to think about their daily routine.
'We knew it wouldn't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the effects of health when choosing to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
The proud culture of ‘keeping awake all night' still exists, he said, as he added that modern technology and increased pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Making sure you have sufficient quality of sleep, it should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat pressure, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation puts the brain into a starving mode, making it always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old California student who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design this course, after taking his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to develop the course across campus.
The next step, he hoped, was to ask all graduate students to complete the same learning program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler suggested that students should consider using the alarm clock before and after bedtime, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' released by electronic screens and LED lighting, which could damage your circadian rhythm from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Mengan killed Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another defeat in opposing place when Dolly Menga's network tied Steven Gerrard's weak army with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox were still looking for a first victory in the opposing place since a 4-1 February victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 resistance as a steward to cause his army to miss eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership's league predecessor Hearts.
Blowing up in the seventh minute before the first half time and the Rangers seemed to have no idea of equalizing.
With the Rangers now down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third ladder and was just behind Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers may be facing yet another problem after the line, Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after having thrown the object from his team's area.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team's advance to the final half of the Betfred Cup after defeating Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, maintains a team of Livi 11 who stole an eye from Hearts last week, and he's certainly happy with the way his team plays that worries their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have mastered the game but Livingston did more tries on the goal.
They were supposed to score just after two minutes when the first touch gave Scott Pittman space through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed.
A free kick from behind Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only send the ball behind the goal.
The Rangers managed to repossess mastery but it stayed just hope for the last thirty minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a penalty kick in the forty-fifth minute while he and Steven Lawless ran into but referee Steven Thomson let the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers only managed to give two precise tries in the first half but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily fended off Lassana Coulibaly's horn and Ovie Ejaria's weak kick.
Even though Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be against the beat of the game, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers once again failed to face Jacobs' premeditated move.
Scott Arfield was just stiff when Declan Gallagher tilted the ball to Scott Robinson who calmly sent it to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard made the exchange during recess by switching Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and it almost had an effect immediately when the winger gave the ball to Morelos but the amazing Kelly got out of his area to block.
But Livingston continues to make it difficult for the opposing team to play the game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sending away a long shipment.
Holt's team was supposed to widen the chasm in the final half but McGregor held out well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow's horn missed from goal angle.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton pleaded another penalty kick while he ran into Jacobs but once again Thomson ignored him.
Almanac: Creator of Geiger Fans · Global Voices
And now, the page from our Almanac Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and HIGHING... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Cineator.
As the main foundation of science since then, the Geiger cauter became the backbone of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring unknown scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Cinema, used to search for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear this earphone, you can actually hear the atomic effects given by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: Well, it sounds now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the creation that carries his name continues to last.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to see bad cells.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to look at bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify evil cells as part of the treatment
The involved method is to extract immune cells from the patient, change them in the lab.
It can look at proteins that normally occur to many cancer cells and then re-inject them.
Experimental vaccines show the results of the patient with different types of cancer.
A woman was treated with a vaccine, which taught the immune system to recognize evil cells, recovering from her ovaric cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab so that they can look at the proteins that are common to many types of cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our exam decision shows that we have a very good vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colorectals, explains Prof Berizofsky.
The same approach to taking immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating the type of leukemia.
Kanye West joins the Pro-Trump Ceremony, wearing a MAGA Hat, after his SNL appearance.
He Was Not Well Accepted
Kanye West was ridiculed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a great performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he'd compete in 2020.
After performing his third song that night called Ghost Town in which he wore the ‘Make America Great' hat, he continued to oppose the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"Many times I asked white people and they said, "How can you support Trump, he's racist?"
Look, if I was worried about racism, I'd moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh confessed in front of the Senate Justice Committee about allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, Kanye West's footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
Not sure if Rock's trying to taunt West with the shipment.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he's been having trouble backstage about his hat.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They're bullying me!
Then they said, I'm in a place that doesn't matter," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "Do you want to see that insignificant position?" by saying that he's going to "wear my superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love"
His comments invite ridicule at least twice from the audience and the SNL actors look embarrassed, reports Variety, with one there telling the publication: "The whole studio is silent."
West was brought in instead of singer Ariana Grande, where her ex-boyfriend, singer Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West surprised a lot of people with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as the Perrier Bottle.
West had the support of TPUSA's conservative group leader, Candace Turner who sent a citation: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR YOUR CHILDREN OF CERITICS."
But from the interview hosts, Karen Hunter said West was just "becoming her and that's great."
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") whom I believe accept and share an ideology that endangers my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Prior to the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now known as "the man once known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, a rapper, Snoop Dogg once changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course his song refers to the legendary music, Prince, which changed his name to a symbol and later also as the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in a stabbing incident at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred at Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be present at the Court of Majistret Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star, Kit Harington bids toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his sword hero Jon Snow in HBO's medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31 years old, has been mistaking the macro hero's stereotyping, by saying his role played on screen means young people often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something was wrong' and questioned how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, recently married to the gaming star of the Games of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she felt 'very strongly' about handling the matter.
'I think it's pretty strong in person, in the present - where did it go wrong with our masculinity?' he said.
'What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problems we see now?'
Kit believes television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He added: 'What is natural and what is taught?
What's taught on television, and on the street, that makes boys feel like they have to be these guys?
I think that's one of the most important questions in the present-- how do we change it?
'Cause obviously there's something wrong with young men these days.'
In the interview, he also admitted he wouldn't play any beginnings or follow-up games of Thrones when the series was over in the next summer, saying he was done with the battlefield and the horses.
In November, Kit will be starring in the re-worked film True West by Sam Shepard which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed he thought meeting with his wife, Rose, was the best thing that happened at Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this plan, so that way, it gives me a family future and my life starts here,' she said.

HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in this country, says health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are sexually transmitted, signaling a change from earlier.
HIV generally spreads rapidly through parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfer.
But the number of people with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the Yunnan region.
Over the years, however, the number of HIV and AIDS sufferers in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be getting worse.
Because of the country's conservative value, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most disease spreads are due to insufficient sexual protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaked GOP senator data, banning 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegations of a staff member who has presented the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the law-governing Wikipedia site.
The Los Angeles Democrats confirmed the claim had been spread by members of the ultra-right wing and website.
"Feeding, fraud and more severe fraud," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
This information was reported to include home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, broadcast by an unidentified person at Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing about sexual misconduct allegations against future Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report IP addresses identifying the cause of the shipment attributed to Waters' office and disseminating information on Waters staff members, Hill said.
"This unfounded accusation is a sham and a lie," Waters said again.
"My limbs--where his identity, personal information, and security have been compromised due to these false allegations--are of absolutely no connection to the leak of this information.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and form a fraud."
Waters' statement quickly invited online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This takeover is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This shows he has no description of being a Congressman.
When someone's accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
They can't resist.
They can't question the accuser's motives.
They must feel calm."
Fleischer said in comparing Waters’ reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics who appeared to be overly angry on Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who contested to kill Waters in mid-election, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great news if it's true," he tweeted.
In reality, Waters said his office had informed "the relevant authorities and entities of law enforcement regarding this false indictment.
"We will make sure the perpetrators will be exposed," he said, "and they will be responsible for all their actions that can destroy and dangerous to any and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - Rowan Atkinson's weak intelligence fraud
It's common now to find signs of Brexit in any new film with British slanga and it seems to apply to the resurgence of Johnny English's action-comedy fraud franchise – which began in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is satira a joke about how badly we become the nation's new export opportunities?
In any case, Johnny English's dull-eyed, bored-faced chance to ruin things for the second time - the name of that signal that's more than all the things that he's a widespread comic creation designed for the territory of non-English movie viewers.
He's certainly a strange covert agent who's acting like he's relaxed by the glamor of Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and a musician who contributed a note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the 2012 London Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He was also inspired by the mysterious international adventurer and spy agent Rowan Atkinson who once appeared in Barclaycard's now forgotten television commercial, leaving the chaos after that.
There was a great time or two in JE's latest film.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter while dressed in medieval armor and fan blades attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy was being shown, but his jokes felt very weak and strange, especially "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offering comedy as their material.
Joke feels like it's highlighted for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's accidental mistake is not innovating and focusing on Atkinson's films in Bean's persona.
The main premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's secret web network, exposing the identities of every British agent in the field and disappointing the agent in charge - a very small character for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a proud prime minister who's struggling with political collapse and unpopularity: Emma Thompson gave her the best with Teresa May's side character but there's nothing good in that script for her character.
His intelligence advisor told him every active spy was compromised, and he had to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is awkward and now works as a schoolteacher in some fancy places, but gives an inappropriate lesson to be a secret agent: some good jokes here, because English offers spy science at academies like the School of Rock.
English was brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former assistant Bough, played back by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, engaged to a submarine commander, a fiery character hosted by Vicki Pepperdine who is quite adverse.
So, the Batman and Robin, who were caught in the Secret Service Under Your Majesty's Highness, are back in action in the face of the beautiful female temptress Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being affected by a charismatic technology millionaire who charges he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their adventure with a small task: disguised as servants, lit fires and set fire to French restaurants; laboriously smuggled themselves into Volta's fancy yacht; and English sparked chaos as she tried to use Maya's Reality headphone to familiarize herself inside Volta's house.
All of the funny scenes were well-placed for the final round, but as it seemed friendly and low-lying there was a bit of a feeling like a children's television show about it.
It's a pretty simple movie.
And just like the other Johnny English movies, I kept thinking: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that really suits his talent?
The Labour Party denied planning for the British people to work four days a week but paid for five days
The head of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn considered a radical design that would watch Britain work four days a week - but get paid for five days.
The party reportedly wanted the company's bosses to channel the savings made through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day's leave.
It will watch the staff enjoy the weekend for three days - but still bring home the same salary.
Sources say, the idea is 'suitable' to the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country to the side of the workers.
Moving on to work for four days a week is supported by the Congress of the Union of Work as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A right source from the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: 'The base study is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
'It won't happen overnight but working for four days a week is an aspiration appropriate to the party's approach to compensate for the economy and to take sides with the workers and the industry strategy of the entire party.'
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party promising four days of work in the election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not thoroughly supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day work week is not the basis of the party and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell used the Labor trial last week by advancing his vision for a socialist revolution in economics.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from 'faceless drivers' and 'catchers' at utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plan also means that the shareholders while in the water company may not be able to recover their entire stock because the Labour government can make a cut based on why they're considered guilty.
He also authorized a plan to place employees in the company's board of directors and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 percent of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether an FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can change their mind.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises questions as to whether the bureau's discovery could affect Republican senators to provide their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy looks more open than his South Carolina partner.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told you to attend the trial, I told you, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, who the charges surfaced, and said, 'Did you do it?'
He's firm, determined, clear."
However, Graham's vote has already been decided.
"I've already made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and he's going to take the heavy charge," she said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know about this: Brett persistently denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone he named couldn't confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any change."
Have People’s Parties Worldwide and Have They Done Something to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host a worldwide People's Party, an annual musical event that has an amazing array of stars and an equally great mission; an end to world poverty.
Now in the seventh year, the World People's Party will see tens of thousands of people gather at the Central Park Home Page to not just watch shows like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Party, started in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international support group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively opposed to it.
To receive free tickets to this event (unless you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), visitors to this concert need to complete several tasks, or "acts" such as volunteering, e-mailing world leaders, making phone calls or any other meaningful means to help increase awareness about their goal of exterminating poverty.
But to what extent has the Worldwide People’s success left 12 years to reach their goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert a sincere way to persuade people to demand an action, or just another "clicktivism" case - make somebody think they've done something by just signing an online petition or by sending a citation?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has said they have recorded 19 million "acts" of its supporters, which urge movement with different goals.
They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and foundations worth more than $37 billion that will bring changes to over 2.25 billion people ahead of 2030.
By the beginning of 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements that resulted from their actions, and at least $10 billion of them had already been collected or had already been collected.
The group also estimates that this identified fund has affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some important committees include the Food Power, a share between investors and screening based in the UK that is committed to "helping children taste their potential fully", promising to contribute $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate uneven eating in that country after receiving more than 4,700 intake from Gobal Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, federal and Global Citizens governments like yourself, we can make this uneven eating social injustice a past tale in history," said Ambassador Tracey Ullman at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said after receiving more than 5,000 calls for the UK to repair the feeding for mothers and children, the government has demanded to finance a project, the Food Power, which will now reach 5 million women and children who need it.
Answers one of the most common questions on his website that says, "What makes you think we can end poverty?"
The Global Citizen has replied: "This is a difficult path and will take time - sometimes we will be disappointed and desperate.
But, just as the movement demands public and antiapartheid rights before, we will succeed, because when we work together we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe were among several artists who shared in making offerings at this year's show in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a "partner" to prevent Russia from exporting oil - Secretary of State
Washington could "if necessary" use his Navy to prevent Russia from selling its oil on the market, including in the Middle East, said U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke according to a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke charged the Russian embalming in Syria - as it is known, involving themselves in the Syrian government's invitation - supposedly to find a new oil market.
"I believe their presence in the Central Tmur is to master the oil supply as they have done in eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the officer, there is a way to address this issue.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea route is open, and if necessary, to prevent it from making sure their oil cannot be marketed," he said.
Zinke said that when he made a speech at a Consumer Energy Alliance encouragement event, an unprofitable group that calls itself "the voice of oil users" in the U.S.
He also compared Washington’s actions to that of Russia and Iran, and stressed that action was the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is roughly the same, affecting and replacing oil," he said, while referring to Russia as having no other choice and with its economy being so dependent on oil.
This statement was issued during Trump's administration on a mission to increase natural export of liquid gas to much cheaper Europe to users in Europe, replacing Russia.
Therefore, Trump's officers, including the U.S. President, Donald Trump himself tried to persuade the German state to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that was "sided", which Trump said would have led Berlin to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project worth $11 billion is going to mark the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters and it's a mere economic project.
The Kremlin refuted Washington so strongly in defiance of this project because of economic causes and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we have an opinion that the power supply should not be used to suppress and that users should be free to vote." said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with U.S. Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This U.S. action has led to the discontent of the German nation, who have reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organization of industry in Germany, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has requested that the U.S. not interfere in the EU's power basis as well as on the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when there's a third country interfering with our national energy supply." said Dieter Kempf the head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladmir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Think Cooking" for Bertanding As President in 2020, Says Massachusetts Senator.
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Senator said on Saturday that she would "think about it" before becoming the presidential candidate following the midterm elections.
When questions opened up with the people of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider a match.
"It's time for a woman to head to Washington and fix our broken government and this includes putting a woman at the top of it," he said according to The Hill's report.
"After November 6th, I'm going to think about it as a presidential candidate."
Warren expressed concern for President Donald Trump when the question opened up, saying that Trump "is driving our country in the wrong direction.
"I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren strongly criticized Trump for nominating Brett Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Federal Court.
In a piece on Friday, Warren said "surely we need an FBI investigation before the vote is made."
However, a review of Thursday’s greetings shows that the majority of the population in the area represented by Warren felt Warren should not compete in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters in Massachusetts said the senator shouldn't compete, according to the University Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center review.
Thirty-two percent support him running.
The review also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to compete, with 38 percent supporting him potentially to compete and 48 percent disagreeing.
The names of other high-profile democtratic members discussed as potentially competing in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden said he was going to decide officially by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin centers on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Track Palin at Trump assembly
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on a Monday night.
"What my own son faced, after returning home, I could feel the feelings of other families facing this PTSD problem and those returning home with injuries," he said at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his son's arrest was "a significant one" and he said of his son and other war veterans as, "they went home different, quite hard and wondered if they would be honored for their sacrifices to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic assault on a woman, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of a gun while drunk, according to Dan Bennet, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18th state, Washington is in favor of the new policy of asylum.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are in favor of opposing a U.S. policy that prevents asylum to victims fleeing terror groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts made the registration of friends to the court on Friday in Washington to support an asylum petitioner who opposes this policy, reports the news of NBC.
Full name plaintive in the case of Grace v. Session of the suit created by the American Civil Freedom Union filed in August on federal grounds has not been disclosed.
He said his partner and "his son's violent group" had tortured him but US officials had refused his asylum application on July 20th.
He's locked up in Texas.
State prosecutors in favor of Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who have the largest number of people applying for asylum in the U.S., as a country filled with the problems of crime and domestic violence.
The new basis for the U.S. asylum application returned one decision made in 2014 in which the Surviving Rayuan Society had justified immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, Columbia Attorney of Justice in a statement on Friday said the new basis "doesn't ignore the state, federal and international laws that existed decades ago."
"Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be decided based on the facts and circumstances that lead to the application, and prevent it from violating that principle," according to a friend's statement to the court.
The district attorneys have also contributed to the dispute that preventing the entry of immigrants would devastate the U.S. economy by saying it is likely that these immigrants will become businessmen and "be necessary labor."
Attorney Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing for domestic violence crimes and due to the violence of an evil group in June.
The Sanctuary will be given to those who leave their homeland for fear of being oppressed for racial, religious, religious or for belonging to certain social groups or for holding to different political handles," Sessions said when announcing this policy on June 11.
The Sanctuary is not meant to solve all problems -- although all problems are serious -- that everyone in the world faces every day.
Rescue work is on the rise in the hammer while the death toll is increasing.
For those who have survived, the situation has become more critical.
"It's very stressful," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who is desecrating her feverish baby boy in the city center of Palu who has collapsed.
"Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
There is very little water to drink."
The residents were seen slowly returning home to their collapsed homes, searching for their belongings in the water while trying to save what they could.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospital was damaged by an earthquake at 7.5 magnitude which was too severe.
Among the injured, including the Double Haris who suffered spinal and shoulder injuries, rested outside the Hammer Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside because there was still an aftershock.
Her tears flowed when she scanned back as the earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel she shared with her wife and daughter.
"none to save ourselves.
I'm pinned to a collapsed wall, I guess," said Haris to the Associated Press, who added that his family is in this city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife's voice asking for help, and then it kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they're safe.
U.S. ambassador indicts China ‘bulging' with ‘propaganda advertisement'
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four - page ad in the U.S. newspaper detailing the common good of trade between the U.S. - China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused China of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a pay-per-view Chinese Daily ad in the Des Moines Register - the most-sold newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing the Chinese state of attempting to interfere in a congressional election on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's allegations that Beijing is attempting to intervene in the U.S. elections explain what U.S. officials reported to Reuters as a new phase in the campaign to press the Chinese state.
Being a regular practice for foreign kingdoms broadcasting advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now contending in one increasingly bad trade war with each charging on their imports.
China's initial action in this trade war was to target exporters in countries like Iowa who supported the Republican Party represented by Trump, say Chinese and US national experts
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China said that Beijng's move had troubled many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in one newspaper room in the Des Moines Register on Sunday wrote, "it is now more bullying by broadcasting propoganda ads in our own free newspapers."
"In broadcasting this propoganda, the Chinese government received the freedom practiced by America, a tradition that puts the freedom of speech and freedom of the press first," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the Beijing press, it's very less of a dissident voice and you can't see the public's true view of China's economic destination which is disturbing because their media is closely controlled by the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He also added "one of the major newspapers in the country of China avoiding an offer to publish" his article, even though he did not state which one.
Republicans Turn Women's Voters Toward Mid Elections Due to the Story of Kavanaugh, Warning By Analysers
Although many well-known Republicans support and side with Brett Kavanaugh the Federal Court candidate facing sexual harassment charges, analysts warn they will invite response in particular from women, in the upcoming mid-election.
High emotions cloud this story and most Republicans say in their records they will continue with a vote.
Those things should not be changed," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science from the Maxwell Study Center, Syracuse University in an article published on Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher wasn't sure Senator Jeff Flake's move to force the FBI to start an investigation was enough to bring in angry voters.
"The women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, right counsel and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters cheered "November is coming!" while expressing their feelings in the Senate building when Republicans in control of the Justice Committee voted to proceed with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic passion and motivation will explode," said Stu Rothenberg a free political analyst to news pages.
"People say this too high; true.
This may be higher especially for women voters who will vote from the suburbs and young voters, 18 to 29 years old, these people don't like the president and rarely vote.
Before Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault against him by a potential Federal Court candidate, analysts thought it would be an outrage if the Republicans continued with confirmation.
"This has become very complicated for the GOP," said Micheal Steela, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC news.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh succeeds as a federal judge, it's also about how Republicans handle this problem and the way they treat him," said Guy Cecil director of USA's priorities a group that helped select Democrats to the newscast.
However, the American people seemed to be split in half and didn't know who to trust in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony with more than half of Ford's side.
Recent YouGov review shows 41 percent said they would believe or might believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed or might believe Kavanaugh
Meanwhile 38 percent say they think Kavanaugh may or may not be lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent talk the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other charge, reports Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian newspaper.
Last week Ford made an oath before the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh abused him drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez also said the Federal Court candidate also showed his dick in front of Ford at a party while he was suing at Yale University in the 1980s.
The Creator of the World Web Page Plans to Start a New Internet Network to View Google and Facebook
World Web Page creator Tim Berners-Lee launched a startup company to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that uses open resources based on Berners-Lee's Solid software.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be entitled to access information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's real purpose was "to rule the world."
"We have to do this now," he said of this initial company.
"It's a historic moment."
This application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, daily work listings, calendars, playlists and other personal professional completeness.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that are available in one browser and simultaneously.
What's unique about storing data in this private tellan is that it's up to the user for who can access the required type of information.
This company calls it "personal mastery through data."
This Ihlam for the Inrupt, according to its Chief Executive Officer John Bruce, is to bring in certain resources, processes and expertise to help people enjoy Solid.
This company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several builders who are contracted to work in this project and a community of volunteer codewriters.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own free applications without focusing on any location using the completeness found in the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee also said he and his team had no discussion with "Facebook and Google to introduce or not introduce a change in which all their business models would change instantly.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In an issue in Medium on Saturday, Bernes-Lee wrote, Inrupt, "the mission is to provide a business energy and ecosystem to help protect the intergrity and quality of new websites built using Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Web Page Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been arguing loudly about the need for websites to be free.
While launching the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as Founder and Director of the World Web Page Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
‘I'm very optimistic for a new era of websites,' Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: First World War Victoria Cross Recipient Fathers celebrated
The only priest from the Church of England who received the Victoria Cross award during the First World War as a combat soldier was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Pastor Benard Vann who received this gift on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an sniper four days later and did not at all know he had ever known that he had been given the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was erected and unveiled by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, says it's "glory symbolic" because it's been opening even 100 years since his grandfather's brave act.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann carried his battalion across the de Saint-Quentin Canal "filled with thick fog and endured a severe machine gun attack."
Then he stormed to the border and with his "great courage" and led him before running around with his own rifle and shooting three people.
Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72 said his grandfather's actions were "something I couldn't possibly repeat and were so moving."
He and his younger brother Dr. James Vann also placed a bouquet of flowers after the act which was headed by the Brentwood Imperial Young Band.
Micheal Vann said "it is a great honor to share in this campaign" and also added "the true courage with the support so many people have given."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they were given Peppa Pig
Imagine that you stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 but were disappointed to see the main event.
The list of San Jose's 13 matches, including the six main matches that will be shown live every night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, the viewers in the UK were astonished when the broadcast turned to Peppa Pig's show.
Some of them were angry because they stayed up all night watching this fight.
One of the fans said the exchange to the children's cartoon channel was "an unsavory joke" through its crack.
"The government rules show broadcasts at 6 a.m. are not appropriate for the fight by which they are forced to broadcast broadcasts for children," said Dave Schwartz, the right deputy president of marketing and Bellator communications when asked about the transmission.
""Peppa the Pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they were trying to reschedule the broadcast so that the UK audience could watch it.
"I think, when I talk about reruns, I think we can do something," said Coker.
‘But at six in the morning on Sundays, there was no way we could do anything until our Sunday time, which was their Monday time.
We're working on it.
Trust me, when the broadcast was changed, there were a lot of retexts and everything was not good to hear.
We're working on this problem, we think it's a technical problem.
But no, it's more of a government issue.
I promise you this won't happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five matches instead of six - as usual - and we're trying to do something that can't possibly be done for fans.
It's a poor situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "lowly" towards sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexuality - but that was the motivation for his success.
He's a 24-year-old who doesn't realize anything until he goes to high school and feels "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he's talking about the right of gays to give other people hope.
He also spoke after his father's title, and he was not so focused on winning the Olympic Games.
A regular performer on this long-running show, Kris Young took a few months off due to illness.
Suddenly appearing in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less than" his peers growing up because "he wasn't socially accepted as a man or a woman."
He said: "To this day, feelings less than others and feelings different from others are things that have driven me and given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his sexuality.
This two-time Olympic sports bronze medal winner is now a high-profile campaigner for the LBGT and has used his appearance in the Commonwealth Sports this year so that more countries will no longer make homosexuals a crime.
He said he spoke this way because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any problems and wanted to give "hope" to others like him.
This three-time world champion said events fell in love with a man - U.S. filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "unprecedentedly"
Daley married that Oscar winner who was 20 years older than he was last year, but he said that their age gap was never an issue.
"When you went through so much experience at such a young age"--he entered the first Olympic sport at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years afterwards--he said it was very difficult to find someone in this age link who went through the same challenges.
The couple became fathers in June to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said "all the perspectives" of his life have now changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's only about ‘I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"There's actually something more than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic sports gold medal is Robbie."
His son's name was after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after he was diagnosed with cancer in the brain.
Daley told his father he didn't want to accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether their London 2012 ticket had been bought - because he wanted to sit in front of him once.
"I couldn't help but say ‘dad wouldn't be there to sit in the front row'." he said.
"I was still holding my father's hand when he stopped breathing and not until my father stopped breathing and was legally dead and I realized that my father would not live forever." he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I realize this is what I've dreamed of all my life--to jump in front of my fans in my own country in Olympic Sports, no other notice could match this," he said.
It was also a source of inspiration for his first choice of song - "Proud" by Heather Small - who echoed with him during preparations for the Olympics and still made his roma fur dim.

Mickelson is not so willing to face the Ryder Cup this Saturday will be rested
American player Phil Mickelson will create a new record this Sunday when he plays for the 47th time in the Ryder Cup competition, but he needs to be prepared to pay back the performance of the game in order not to end in grief.
Mickelson who will play in this bi-yearly event for a record 12 times, has been rested by captain Jim Furyk for the "fourballs" and "foursomes" game this Saturday.
Behind being a regular focus for the United States, the winner of these five major games spends time as a cheerleader and training in hopes of improving the quality of the game.
A man who can't hit the ball straight even when he's at the top of his game, this 48-year-old player is not the right choice for the Le Golf National golf course, where the distance is very difficult for a hit that doesn't hit the target.
And if this golf course is just difficult, Mickelson in the ninth match this Sunday will meet the winner of the British Open, Francesco Molinari who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If an American player, missing four points starts with 12 individual games, starts with a fierce start, then Mickelson's game is definitely very important.
Furyk was so sure of his players, that's all he could say.
"He understood his role today, and patted him on the shoulder and put his hand on my shoulder and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"His self-confidence is very high.
He's been famous and has contributed a lot of service to this team for a long time, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he'd play in two games.
I imagine it's more than that, but that's the way and the way we think we should do it.
He wants to be a part of it, like everybody else.
Mickelson will outlast Nick Faldo's record for the most appearances in the Ryder Cup this Sunday.
This may be the last time he'll be in the Ryder Cup that never compares to his personal record achievements.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost 20 times and seven series, although Furyk said his presence brought one injection of spirit to his army.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to play around, he likes to pick people up and it's really fun if he's in the team room," she said.
"I think all the young players are having fun with him, this week, and it feels good to see him.
He not only played but more than that.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knew their position ahead would be slowly lost.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knew from his experience that a position far ahead of his could disappear in the last day of the Ryder Cup and make things difficult.
This Danish player first entered the 1997 game at Valderrrama, where Seve Ballesteros was driving as captain and ahead of the American team with five points but only managed to win with a very thin score of 141⁄2⁄1⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself after a forward position at Valderrama; we also got the lead at Brookline but we lost and at Valderram we won, but won thinly," said Bjorn after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to be ahead by 10-6 points at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on that team that this game isn't over yet.
We fight our way out tomorrow.
Go out and play hard and make no mistake.
It's not over until the eyes are picked up and inscribed on the sign.
We have this goal of ruling out this trophy, and we're going to focus on this goal.
I told you, I'll focus on the 12 players on our team, but we all need to know who we're up against -- they're the greatest players in the world.
So happy with his men's achievements on the golf course so difficult, Bjorn added: "I can't possibly guess.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow's individual achievements have to shine and that's something different to do.
It's great to be out there with a friend and when things go well, but when you're alone, your full capacity as a golfer will be tested.
This is the message that all players need to hear, give it their best tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he should give the best in himself too."
Contrary to Bjorn's views, his opponent Jim Furyk would expect his players to play well as individual players compared to team events, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to get three points out of the fours.
Furyk himself had an experience on the last day where the position changed, while on the winning team at Brookline before losing suddenly when the Europeans performed "Miracles at Medina."
"I remember every word," he said while answering the question the way Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999 burned the player's spirit on the last day.
"We have 12 more events tomorrow, but if you want to get started quickly as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When the momentum starts, it puts pressure on the event in the middle.
We'll line up our players according to one rule that we feel is appropriate, we'll try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of fighting back and meeting Rory McIlroy in the main event, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, European players in the top part of the first.
"I made this rule because I think it's going to be true and include all of it," Bjorn said regarding the individual player's choice.
Germany's new warship is delayed again.
The German Navy should receive its latest frigate in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but the ship won't be ready until next year because of system damage and growing costs, according to local media reports.
The broadcast of the warship "Rhineland-Pfalz", the first ship under the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate now has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit who picked up a military spokesman.
This warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, unfortunately post-harvesting problems hit the fate of this big project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates forged by the Navy in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class frigate.
It's understood, it will contain properties such as high-powered cannons, various antiship and antiship gear and some invisibility features such as reduced detection by radar, red lights and caustic capabilities.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance duration - this latest frigate must be able to sail for up to two years from its base.
However, the various obstacles mean this sophisticated warship which is said to be capable of highlighting German power abroad - will be outdated by the time this ship joins the Navy service, according to Die Zeit
This unfortunate frigat F125 became a headline last year, when German Navy officers refused to lecture the warship in and return it to the Blohm & Voss shipbuilding company in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to its builders after shipping.
Not much is known why the ship was repatriated, but the German press mentioned some of the damage to "security and devices" rendered this battleship useless when sent to combat missions.
The damage to the software should be taken care of because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warship will be handled by only 120 sailors - half of what is needed to handle the old Bremen-class frigates.
There's also a thing where this warship is too heavy and this will reduce the performance and limit the Navy's ability to make any improvements in the future.
The 7,000-tan warship "Rheinland-Pfalz" was believed to be twice as heavy as the same class of warships used by the German army during World War II.
In addition to the damage to the device, the overall price of the project - including training for sailors - is also an issue.
The project is said to have reached €3.1bilion ($3.6bn) - increasing than its original price of €2.2 billion Euro.
The problem with this latest frigate warship shows how much the German naval capabilities are missing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee in parliament admitted the Navy was indeed facing the problem of lacking a capable warship.
The officer also said that the issue was getting worse, since the old warships that had been stopped had not gotten an alternate battleship.
He complained none of the frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships could join the Navy.
National Trust settles the life of the bat
The latest study being conducted on an estate on Scotland’s highlands aims to explain why bats use the shape of the face of the earth to hunt for food.
It is hoped that this study will lead to recent discoveries regarding the behavior of unique mammals capable of this flight and can be a guide to conservation activities.
Research by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow regular bats, and bat soprano peetrelles as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in specific locations around the estate to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also make mobile reviews using mobile detection devices.
The expert on the sound of all recordings will identify the frequency of every kind of bat and its specie and the actions of this bat.
A map of the habitat and a report will be produced to create a picture of the face of the earth on a scale of the bat's behavior.
Rob Dewar, an advisor to the NTS, hopes that the results of this study will show the most important habitat area to the bat and the way it is used by every species of bat.
This information will help identify habitat management benefits such as creating a field of doubt and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined considerably since the past century.
Bats are threatened by building and construction work that disrupts the spot of the bat and loses its habitat.
Wind turbines and lamps are also the same risk to bats as flytrap paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials and pet cat attacks.
The real bat isn't blind.
Because bats hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use location detection techniques to use sounds to identify the position of insects and obstacles while on flight.
The NTS responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 acres of land all over the country are concerned with bats.
They have ten well-trained experts who often run surveys, check the place for sores and sometimes save bats.
It has also established one bat protection center in Scotland in Threave estet in Dumfries and Galloway, which is where eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland live.
David Thompson the manager of the estate said this estate is the best place for bats.
"At Thereave we had a very suitable place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of big trees and suitable habitat.
There's a lot more we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what the bat needs to live and grow.
He stressed how important it is to conduct an examination before starting maintenance work in the real estate because there's a chance we could accidentally destroy the bat's nest that would contain the bat's cubs where this could kill 400 female bats and the bat's child, and possibly destroy an entire population of local bats.
Bats are protected and are wrong to kill, molest or disrupt or destroy a nesting bat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer for the Bat Conservation Trust encouraged the public to help.
He said: "There's still a lot we have to learn about bats and for many species we don't know how their population develops."
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape while his lawyer prepares to sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of raping himself as "fake news" and said some people were about to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer will sue the German magazine, Der Spiegel, who published these allegations.
This Portuguese front-runner and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Then he was said to have paid $375,000 to keep the victim's mouth shut according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to 142 million of his followers a few hours after these allegations were reported, the 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced this report as "false news."
"Not true.
What they said today was fake news," said winner of the 5 award Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
Get used to it.
They want to be famous by saying my name, this is part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," said the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue De Spiegel on this charge, which they call "an unfounded and disturbing report," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would sue for damages for "moral damages that directly affect his personality, which may be one of the most serious abuses of personal rights in recent years."
This incident was reported in June 2009 in a luxury suite of the Palms and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly returned to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of stalking the woman without permission, according to an investigation paper registered at the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Major claimed after the incident the player knelt before him and said he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and only fell down because "one percent."
The document authorized Ronaldo to confess to having sex, but on the basis of his liking.
Major also claimed he filed a police report and took pictures of the injuries suffered at the hospital, but later agreed to settle them outside the court because he was "fear of response" and worried about being "disrupted by the public."
The 34-year-old woman now wants to undo her previous solution because she's still traumatized by what happened.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester when these allegations occurred, and this summer he has moved to the Italian football giant Juve for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever' for losing a car manufacturer
UK "will regret forever" if it loses its world leader status in automobile production after Brexit, said Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
He also added this is a bit of a "disquiet" because Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without a solution, it would stop the production of the car at Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
"We need a solution," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effects of this would result in shipping problems at the border if there was no solution to Brexit and this would cause job loss.
The factory in Burnaston - which issued the Toyota Auris and Avensis - installed nearly 150,000 units of cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my view if Britain leaves the European Union without any solution at the end of March, we will stop the production of the car at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota affairs at Burnaston.
Some other car manufacturers in the UK include, Honda, BMW and Jaguar and Land Rover as well as saying their concerns if the UK leaves the European Union without a solution on how the border crossing trade will work.
For example, BMW said they'd shut down their Mini-car factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern with car manufacturers is the risk to the supply network in case of Brexit without any solution.
The production of Toyota cars depended on the installation basis based on timely acceptance of supplies without having to be stored with car parts brought into the factory every 37 minutes from the entire UK and European Union of booked cars.
If the UK gets out of the European Union without any settlement on 29 March, there will likely be a commotion at the border that industry players predicted there would be a delay and a shortage of replacements.
Toyota couldn't have kept inventory supplies for more than a day at the Derbyshire factory, said the company was concerned, so production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said the future plan of Finance Minister Theresa May's two-way relationship with the European Union "needs to do precisely to avoid any inspections at the border."
"We need a solution. "We want a solution that will allow not just success for the present but for us to experience this opportunity," he told the BBC on Radio 4's Today programme.
"Not only from Toyota but also these other producers indicate we must continue this very successful networking network
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be stopped, but for a long time it warned it would increase costs and reduce the cost of this factory and so on would result in loss of employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a unionist responsible for union management at this factory, said the unionists are already beginning to fret: "Following my experience, the lost work will never come back.
A spokesperson for the government said: "We have come up with a very precise plan for future relations between us and the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and deputy attorney Rod Rosenstein may be "rejected to next week" because of Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy as a continuing federal court candidate, according to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein, who oversees the investigation of special attorney Robert Mueller, is connected to Russian interference in the election, the relationship between Trump and Russian assistants and the possibility of obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney or not and further disrupting Mueller's freedom to continue the investigation has become the warmest rumor in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein was planning on using a secret recording device to record his conversation with Trump and possibly to replace the president by using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on last Monday, he went to the White House, behind reports saying he would resign.
Instead it was announced one meeting on Thursday with Trump who at the time was in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was "not willing" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was postponed to avoid him meeting Kavanaugh's confession and Dr Christine Blassey Ford one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of molesting him, in front of the Senate's judicial committee, both of which they gave confessions.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the indictment against Kavanaugh, which has suspended full voting in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date hasn't been set yet, probably in this week, I think it might be delayed another week given some of the things that are going on in federal court.
We'll see about that and I'll keep the press updated.
Some of the reporters will argue: Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10.
When his host, Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said he didn't hold many press conferences not because he didn't like TV reporters trying to find "attention" but he also said: "I don't agree because they do want attention."
Then he said the relationship between the press and Trump would grow.
"The president has held the most question-of-answer sessions compared to the presidents before him," he said without giving any evidence. "We've done the math."
The press conference will still be held, Sanders said, but if the press had a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it would be better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and this will replace the press conference when you can speak directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answered questions from the press on his way out of the White House or while taking part in open - question sessions or during media meetings with distinguished guests.
The media congregation as a person is very rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he sometimes makes appearances freely and strangely in front of the gathered reporters.
The health secretary wrote to European Union workers in NHS about their concern for Brexit.
The Secretary of State has written a letter to all European Union workers working in NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to this country and to hope that they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to the cost of the application of European citizens of the Union who work in its public sector.
In her letter, Miss Freeman wrote: "In the summertime, negotiations between the UK and the European Union regarding the resignation have continued, and are heading towards a decision ahead of the fall.
But the UK government has increased preparations to face one scenario without a solution.
I know this is something that concerns you all a lot.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each one of you, regardless of your citizenship.
Fellow workers from all over the European Union and other countries, bringing along many experiences and expertise that strengthen and improve health care and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you all to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Underwent Emergency Surgery After Having Injured Head
Tennessee State Tigers defenseman Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury after losing 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Coach Rod Reed told reporters the injuries occurred just before the second half.
"He approached the edgeline and suddenly collapsed there," Reed said.
The interns and health officials gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting him in the stretcher and taking him for further treatment.
An officer from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had finished surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added "no information on the type/how deep the injury is at the moment" and Tennessee State is trying to identify when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-year red-shirt prosecutor, played the first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He's already done five times on Saturday before he's out of the game, his total desperation this season is 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp duty when they buy real estate in the UK and this extra money will be used to help homeless people under the Tory's latest show.
This move will invalidate Corbyn's success to attract young voters
This stamp duty will be imposed upon those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is expected to collect up to £120 million a year - to help vagrants
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher stamp duty if they buy real estate in the UK - money than this will be used to help homeless people, says Theresa May today.
This move looks like it's going to blow Jeremy Corbyn's success to attract young voters with the promise of providing affordable housing and making high-income people a target.
This increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, money from these results will help the government solve the problems of people who do not have a place to live.
This addition - is an addition to the stamp duty that has already been worn including a higher duty that has been introduced two years ago to a second house and a house purchased for rent that may be worn three percent.
The Treasury is expected to collect up to £120 million a year by this step.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new estates were bought by those who were not UK citizens, causing prices to rise and make it difficult for those who wanted to buy their first home.
Most luxury areas - especially in the capital - have become "silent" because many of the owners are foreign owners who spend a lot of time abroad.
This new policy was announced only a few weeks after Boris Johson demanded that stamp duty be reduced so that more young people could buy their first home.
He accused the large construction company of deliberately maintaining high real estate prices by buying land but not waking it up, and petitioning Mrs. May to remove quotas upon the affordable home belonging to overcome Britain's "disgrace housing problems".
Mr. Corbyn has announced several interesting series of housing renewal proposals, including rent control and abolishing "not guilty" evictions.
He also wanted more power given to the council to build a new house.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my term to the prime minister to restore the dream of Britain - this life must improve for every generation to come.
And that means fixing our poor housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to stay, work and build a life here.
However, it's not fair because it's very easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as companies that are based abroad to buy homes compared to the hard-working British population here.
For too many people, the dream of having a home of its own is so far away, and the fact of living all over the place with humiliation is true.
Jack Ross: ‘My main goal is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa said his "primary goal" was to become Scotland's manager one day.
The 42-year-old citizen of Scotland is looking forward to the challenge of reinvigorating the North-East club on the third ladder in League One, less than three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Prime League last season.
"I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for B cap and so far," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there was something that always drew me there.
That chance will only come, if I succeed as manager at the club level.
Ross' replacements as steward of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athetic manager said he didn't feel anxious about following in the footsteps of such a famous name in the big clubs, as he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"For me the meaning of success at this point is ‘can I bring this club back into the Prime League?
Because of the structure and facilities that exist in this club, it should really be in the Prime League," he said.
"It's not easy to reach, but I'd consider myself successful if I could get this club back into the Prime League."
Ross was only three years in management, having been assistant manager at Dumbarton and coached at Hearts' for 15 months.
He later helped Alloa return to level three after being demoted and changed the fate of St Mirren rather than being demoted to the next season's Champion.
And Ross says he's more comfortable now than he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's an option," he recalled, when managing Alloa.
"I do know management really suits me, rather than playing.
Maybe it's weird because I'm successful, able to have a good life and enjoy some interesting moments.
Playing's tough.
There's a lot you have to go through every week.
I still went through pressures and pressures as a player but as a manager I was more comfortable.
I've always wanted to take care of it and now I'm doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something I've liked all my adult life."

The best time for a beer is 5.30pm on Saturday, according to studies
This summer heat wave brings luck to Britain's pubs facing problems but the chained restaurants also experience pressure.
The pub and bar groups showed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but at the restaurant it dropped 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consulting firm who collected these numbers, said: "The ongoing heat weather and longer England World Cup campaigns mean that July will follow the pattern of June, where the pubs are up 2.8 percent, unless the restaurant drops worse.
The fall of 1.8 percent of the business at the restaurant in June got worse in July.
The pub's achievements that put drink and bar first are very strong compared to those of a downed restaurant.
Pubs that put food first also suffer bad luck because of the heat, but they are not as bad as restaurant controllers.
Looks like most people just want to go out for a beer.
Pub-pubs and bars accounted for a 6.6 percent increase in sales for the month, while food dropped by 3 percent.
Paul Newman's entertainment and food analyzer from RSM said: "This decision seems to be the same and continues since the end of April.
Weather and social events or sports events are still a major factor in the increase in sales on the market outside the home.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups continue to crowd, selling down 4.8 percent in comparison to this year would be even worse with the cost pressure.
Long summer heat strikes the restaurant handlers at a bad time and only time will determine if cooler weather like ours in August will bring relief."
The amount of increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, 2.7 percent in July show moisture in newly introduced brands.

Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice to athletes" in the Scottish Athletics institution
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to the Scottish Athletics board as non-executive director at the general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most famous race athlete and chairman Ian Beattie explains that this step is an opportunity for those who have taken the sport to benefit from Doyle's experience at international levels for more than a decade.
"Ilidh is very respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athlete community and we're sure the athletes in Scotland will get a big deal by inclusion of him in this institution," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice to all athletes and I hope to contribute and help guide this sport at Scotand
This American sportsman who won a gold medal for the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta now owns four Olympic gold medals and now does coverage for the BBC, after not being able to walk through a heart attack.
He made a citation: "On this day last month I contracted a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor said only time can determine where I can recover.
It's not easy to be who I am, I have to learn to walk again and today I have to do intelligence training!
Thank you for all your support!"
Mother's milk pump advertisements that compare cows bring conflicting opinions online
A mother’s milk - pumping company received a variety of conflicting opinions online because their advertisements compared breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked for milk.
To launch what the silent, wearable mother's milk pump in the world, Elvie's technology company released a joke-shaped music video to show the freedom that mothers can feel using this new pump.
Four mothers danced in a barn full of straw to a song where the lyrics read: "Yeah, I pump my own milk, but you can't see any tails" and "if you don't realize this isn't my nipples, it's my boobs."
The chorus goes: "Pam out, pump out, I'm breastfeeding kids, pump out, pump out, I'm pumping my boobs."
However, this ad published on the firm's Facebook page has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, this video has invited a lot of reactions from the general, many say it gives a cheerful picture of the "horrible" tenus industry.
"An unnatural decision to use an ox to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows need to be pregnant and have to give birth to children to produce milk, but unfortunately the calf is divorced from the calf within days they are born," said one writer.

Another commented: "It's a trauma for cows and calves.
"But how about using them to advertise milk pumps for mothers who can save their children"?
Another added: "One missed ad."
Someone else defended the ad, with one woman claiming that she found the song "very ludicrous."
"I think this is a genius idea.
I'll buy one if I still give you body milk.
Pumping makes me feel really like a cow.
The ad was definitely a little crazy but I thought of it as shown.
This is a product of genius," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad addressed to a pumping mom (always at work or at the toilet) and feels like "a condiment."
This is not an advertisement that praises or assesses the tenusu industry."
At the end of the video, a bunch of women reveal that they've all been dancing with pumps hidden in their underwear.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the notion that most women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, Pam Elvie was completely silent, had no wires or tubes and could be loaded hidden in a milking shirt, giving women the freedom to move, holding their babies, and also going out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Pam Elvie is such a revolutionary product, it does deserve a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing the pumping woman to the milk cow, we want to place the pumping of milk and all the challenges associated with it as a primary focus, showing us how to comfort and relate to the feeling of independence through the use of new pumps.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has been a headline.
During London Fession Sunday, a mother of two children appeared on the show stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Children's Servants Switched Quietly to Camp Camp Camps on the Texas Border
The number of migrants detained increased even though the transfer of monthly borders did not change much, as by the rhetoric and heavy policy known to Trump administration, making the placement of children with guarantors increasingly difficult.
According to tradition, the guarantors are undocumented immigrants, and they're afraid of damaging their position to stay in the country if they take a child.
The risk escalated in June, when federal authorities announced that there would be guarantors and other adult members in the family would have to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the right-hand officer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified in front of Congress that the agency has detained dozens of individuals who have applied to be guarantors to unguarded children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the same individuals whether guarantors or family members are here unlawfully and most of them are unauthorized immigrants.
With that, we will continue to hunt the individual," said Albence.
In order to process children faster, authorities introduced new rules that require some of them to attend court within a month of detention, not after 60 days according to previous standards, according to protective workers.
Many will attend by video conference calls, rather than personally present, to plead their case for legal standing before immigration judges.
Those deemed unfit for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are under arrest, the more likely they will be to become anxious or moody, and this will lead to an act of anger or an attempt to escape, according to protective custody and according to reports released by the system in the last few months.
Supporters say that such concerns are higher in larger facilities like Tornillo, where a sign that children struggling with feelings may not be detected, because of the size of the place.
They added that by moving children to a camp town without making time for them to be emotionally prepared, or saying goodbye to friends it might be worse for the trauma they face.
Syria's U.S., French and Turkish troops are retreating immediately.
Speaking at the United Nations Supreme Court, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, urged the Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in the country had reached the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as deputy prime minister, said foreign soldiers on Syrian soil under the trick of fighting violence "will be subject to appropriate action."
"They shall stand down immediately and unconditionally," he told the conference.
Moualem insists that the "war on violence is over" in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been homeless.
He said Damascus will continue to fight this holy war until we wipe out Syria's territory from both violent groups and "any foreign occupation".
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, specifically for training and advising the Kurdish and Arab Syrian army against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the planet.
On the matter of the escape, Moualem said, the conditions were appropriate for them to return, and he accused the "half-country abroad" of "spreading irrational fear" which caused the refugees not to return.
"We have called upon international communities and humanitarian organizations to help this return," he said.
"They're politicizing what should be humanity's sole issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given rebuilding aid until political agreements are held between Assad and the rebels to end the war.
UN diplomats say the agreement between Russia and Turkey to provide a military-free zone in the Idlib rebel-controlled area has created an opportunity to continue political discussion.
The Russian-Turkey talk has diverted a major attack by the Russian-backed Syrian army in a region where three million people live.
Moualem however asserted, the agreement had "a real deadline" and expected military action would target jihadists including rebels from the Nusra Front associated with Al Qaeda, who "will be abolished."
U.N. special envoy, Staffan de Mistura hopes to arrange the first meeting of a new committee, which contains governments and dissident members to assess the post-war development and pave the way for elections.
Moualem stated the terms of the Syrian government's inclusion in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "checking current institutional articles," and warning against interference.
Because Trump Will Win the Second Excavation
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, as expected by liberal observers, allegations of dismissal and scandal ending his presidential visit before his time.
In an undisputed situation as "The most dramatic finale for a presidential visit!"
Right now, there's no sign of lethargy.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have increased more twice as much to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average prime time audience of 2.4 million, an additional 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has preceded cable ratings, up to 3.5 million viewers on the eve of the premiere.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's not something that we understand," said Neal Baer, the ABC drama publisher's "Designated Survivor," the story of the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack on The Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," had another theory.
He recalled a taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he'd vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
She said, "Because she makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is a value of entertainment in chaos.
Right, unlike what's on TV, the storyline from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite or global economic health.
Not following developments is just a pleasure for a fortunate audience.
However, it slips away from being a knowledgeable citizen when you find you're watching a panel of experts arguing over the use of a ‘deep background" by Bob Woodward' in search of the source for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin bomber ("a thick, magnificent cotton," says The Washington Post) and a sensational description by Stormy Daniels of ah, Trump's anatomy.
I won't see Super Mario with the same view again.
"In part what he does is as if in a reality program that looks like he's bribing you up something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive chief of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars," about Trump's story with an actor exchange and daily plot exchange (starting a fight with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).

When I visited Fleiss this week, the weather outside his home north of Kauai was clear 80 degrees, but he was holed up in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He can't leave TV, not when Brett Kavanaugh is set to face the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is still uncertain.
"I remember when we used to do this crazy show and people used to say, "This is the beginning of the end of western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke but it was real they were tinged."

External money floods into a fierce contest. Mid-election hall.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th election showed a flood of money, given the resumption of congressional districts showing two visitors now competing for the same seat.
The area of Pittsburg subcity redrawed matched Democrat Conor Lamb's representative - who won his seat in the special elections of the previous spring.
Lamb is competing with another current pioneer, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of old Pennyslvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The map was redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district had been gerrymandered on Republican sides.
The new 17th Games has started a fierce financial campaign competition between the financial machinery of the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a commonly heard name in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in Mac's special election for the 18th Congressional District of Pennyslvania watched by the crowd.
The chair was won by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
The clever political class has given the Democrats an advantage.
The U.S. Counts to fine El Savador for support of China, then withdraws.
Republican diplomats Dominica and Panama have recognized Beijing, with little negative response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until a partner drove off the Trump Organization's management team.
Government officials decided to call back the U.S. diplomatic representatives from El Salvador, the Republic of Dominica and Panama because of "the latest decision not to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the department said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fine was only imposed on El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including narco control and economic support.
The fines suggested, including cuts to financial aid and intended visas, will have a negative effect on the Central American country with high rates of interference and murder.
After an internal meeting was held, North American and Central American officials intercepted a high-level conference that focused on safety and economic prosperity, for the aftermath of a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in preventing immigrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid - September, top administrators decided that they wanted the trial to continue, effectively halting any consideration to fine El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, as an import signal for administration at the meeting, according to diplomats.
And all three American representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Republic of Dominica with no strict message or fine from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officers, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on the condition of anonymousity.
Their description is supported by external analysts who are close to the administration and also speak anonymously.
History Studies
The next thing that's gonna happen may be the report of the special attorney Robert Mueller against the possibility of a obstruction of justice by Trump, which is now solid evidence in the general record.
Mueller will also lead an investigation into whether Trump's campaign has joined the Russians in an attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face responsibility on the party, as soon as he's ready to face the vote, and maybe finally a jury that contains his equal partner.
This is everything if, and I'm not saying that Trump's fall is bound to happen - or people like him in Europe.
There's a choice that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long this struggle is going to take.
In 1938, German officials were ready to attempt a coup against Hitler, in case the West did not follow Hitler and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We've failed, and we've missed an opportunity to avoid the brutal killings that occurred in the next few years.
The course of history revolves around such a point of inflection, and the path of an unstoppable democracy will be accelerated or suspended.
The American people face some point of this inflection now.
What are we gonna do if Trump fires Assistant State Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been having problems since this newspaper reported that, in the past year, he has planned to make a recording of the president and speculate that the president is unfit for the position.
Rosenstein said the Times didn't say exactly.
"How are we going to act if the FBI's request for a new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he's passed into the Agong Court despite the real accusations of sexual assault and evidence of fraud?
And moreover, are we going to vote for the Congressional cesspool to which Trump will be accounted?
If we fail the test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was banished to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regim who had conquered my embassy home.
He survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table with a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against Austria, following from the series with Spain in opposition to Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a solid position to qualify them in Group G in the European League.
An injury to the knee prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his eventual appearance this season until a 2-2 series with Villarreal, but he believed the Rangers used this decision as a stepping stone to a great victory.
"It's a good point because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We played in this match with a belief that we would get something and we had got one eye.
We may be able to win by the end of the match, but the series may be a fairer result.
They probably played better in the first half and we played better in the second middle and in the nicer side.
On Thursday, another great European night.
We hoped we'd earn three points but the competition was difficult because they got good results in the previous game but, the audience supported us, I'm sure we'll play well and get positive results.
Last year was tough, between everything that happened with my injuries, and the fight in the club but there's a fun factor about this place right now.
The squad is good and the team is happy; training is also good.
We hope we can do our best, leave last season and succeed."
Women can't sleep because of this pension savings concern
Although the review of the participants had a clear idea of how they would like to be maintained, some had discussed it with their family members.
Half of the induviduals in the study of the whole country claimed that they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long - term maintenance.
Only 10 percent talked to their children about it.
"They want family members to take care of them but not take steps to discuss," said Holly Snyder, the vice president of the entire country's insurance business.
Here's a way to start.
Talk to your spouse and your child: You won’t be able to provide care for your family if you don’t tell them first.
Working with your advisers and your family to discuss where and how to get care, for that choice will be an important factor in knowing the cost.
Bring your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you find ways to pay for such expenses.
Funding for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash life insurance policy to help protect these expenses or self-insured insurance with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Complete your legal documents: Settle legal warfare at a time.
Set a health care representative in place so that you can appoint someone you trust to watch your health care and keep professionals in line if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, a representative’s letter of authority for your finances.
You will choose someone you trust to make a decision for you and make sure that your bill is paid if you are not able to.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only is finance set, but who is his doctor?" asked Martin.
"What is medicine?
Who's gonna look after the dogs?
Set it slow."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 have been killed by strong earthquakes and tsunamis hitting the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the number of deaths is expected to rise.
With the lack of communication systems, the authorities were unable to get information from the Donggala government, a northern area of the Hammer close to the epicenter with a magnitude 7.5 concussion.
In the Hammer more than 16,000 people have been moved after the disaster.
Here is the main fact about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary during the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala government area 300 km (180 miles) northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The holding area, the administrative region under the territory, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and breeding became the economic spine of the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala watershed.
Nickel mining is also important in this region, but it is only concentrated in Morowali, on the coast in opposition to Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by Tsumani several times in 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami sacrificed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami had also struck west of Donggala in 1996, sacrificing 9 people.
Indonesia is located seismically in the Pacific Fire Circle and has always been hit by earthquakes.
Here are major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake in the western surveillance of the Acheh region of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 Dis has triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, costing 226,000 people along the waters of the Hindi Ocean, half that number in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, sparking a tsunami that hit the south coast, sacrificing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang City, the capital of the West Sumatra region.
Over 1,100 people have died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, in Sumatra, sparking a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and sacrificed in 300 people.
2016: A simple violent earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya government area of Acheh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the massive earthquake and tsumnami events in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered at the time, but over 100 were killed by building collapses.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Lombok, sacrificing over 500 people, especially in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of travelers stranded for the time being.

This is not the first time a criminal charge has been made against Palin.
In December 2017, you were accused of assaulting your father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the allegations of the attack.
This case is mentioned in the Alaskan Military Court.
In January 2016, she has been accused of domestic assault, interfering with reports of domestic violence crimes and possessing a weapon in a drunken state related to the incident.
Palin’s girlfriend claimed the man punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veteran soldiers in 2016 after associating her son with PTSD following her service in Iraq.
Tsunami of the Indonesian earthquake: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical supplies and communications networks are also affected by the expected death toll rising within the next day.
Gepa earth struck outside Tangah Sulawesi located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Videos were distributed on social media showing the time of the incident.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate a feast in Palu when a tsunami struck the coast.
The prosecution demands an unusual death sentence for a NYC terrorist attack suspect.
New York prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the New York City suspect of a violent attack that killed eight people -- an extraordinary sentence that hasn't been executed in the state mention for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using a rental Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle route along Westbound Highway in Lower Manhattan, crashing into pedestrians and bikers in his tracks on Oct.
To justify the murder sentence, prosecutors have to prove that Saipov "intended" to kill eight of the victims and "intended" to inflict serious bodily harm, according to an intent to prosecute the death penalty, filed in Southern District, New York.
Both charges lead to the death penalty, according to the court's doctrine.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury has charged Saipov with 22-per-view charges including eight counts of murder due to illegal activity, which has always been used by prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "discussive planning and planning", according to the prosecutor, determining how Saipov carried out the act as "dumb, cruel and despicable."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, pains, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to intentions.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Been as close as the Southern District of New York to the death penalty case.
Defendant, Khalid Barnes, had been charged with murdering two drug dealers but had finally been sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed on a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death using the electric chair on 19 June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, felt no guilt in the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He made a statement to the investigators that he was happy with what he was doing, following the police.
Saipov said he was compelled to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS video on the phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "really disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We feel the decision to prosecute the death penalty rather than to accept a confession of guilt for life imprisonment with no possibility of release, only to extend the trauma of this event to all involved," according to Patton.
Saipov's previous defense, asked the prosecutor not to demand the death penalty.
According to the Tory Member of Parliament, NIGEL FARAGE should be accounted for running Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to 'move the people's army' today during the protests at the Tory conference.
Former Ukip chief said, politicians should 'feel the material' of ‘Eurosceptics' - because one of the MPs of Theresa May, recommending he should be given the responsibility of handling negotiations with the EU.
Conservative deputy Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would be out by now if Farage became Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge May faced was to resolve the divisions between members who supported the Tories Remain Members who joined the protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is working to ensure Chequers' compromise plan remains in the middle of an attack from the Brexiteer, Remain and EU.
The allied strong May conduct negotiations with Brussels despite the effects faced - and the power of Eurosceptic and Labour to choose between his package or 'trouble'.
Bone told the gathering out meant getting out in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of Chequers.
He recommended Farage be made a nobleman and was given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
'If he had been given that responsibility, we'd be out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough members of Parliament added: 'I support Brexit but we must remove Chequers.'
Setting up objections against the EU, he said: 'We are not fighting in a world war to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Bone rejected the suggestion that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain incorrect at all.'
Brexit Tory's supporter, Andrea Jenkyns who also followed the march, told reporters: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people's voice.
'Chequers are not popular among the public, the rebels won't vote in support, it's not popular in our parties and the activityists who are on the street and who have voted for us.
Please drop Chequers and start listening.'
In a message addressed to May, she added: 'The Prime Minister will continue to take their positions if they keep their promises.'
Farage said political experts need to 'feel the material' if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'Now this is the trust between us - the people - and the political class,' he said.
'They tried to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them 'we won't let them get away with doing so.'
In a message to a passionate audience he added: 'I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, to feel its material.
‘We are depriving the people's army that gave us victory in the Bexit and will not rest until we make United Kingdom free, self-government, proud.'
Meanwhile, Remainer marches through Birmingham before holding a meeting in the middle of town.
A swarm of activists flew the Tories Against Brexit after the launch of the group at the end of the week.
Peer Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives about the security issues they faced with the party application when the conference began.
'They say they can hold the IT system in its place and all the technology with Canada and so on, for borders without conflict, for trade without borders,' he added.
'It's all a charade.
There's no such thing as a nice Brexit,' he went through.
Warren's planning to study to compete for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would 'research to compete for the post of president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that members of the Massachusetts Democrats delivered their future plans during the ‘town hall' in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, the strong critic of President Donald Trump, was competing for re-election in November with GOP state Rep candidate Geoff Diehl, who was joint chairman of the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
He is speculated to be competing with Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th time meeting with a gunner using the ‘town hall' format since Trump's office.
One participant asked if he wanted to compete for the presidency.
Warren replied it was time "for women to Washington to repair a broken government, and this included a woman on the upper stairs."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton neared the brink of a world championship when the troops ordered him to win, defeating Sebastian Vettel
It was clearly evident at the time, Valtteri Bottas qualified himself in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, "the Mercedes command plays an important role in this race.
From the beginning of the square, Bottas started well, nearly defeating Hamilton while defending his position in the first two rounds and asking Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel got in the pit first and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, something that should be final.
Mercedes then goes into the pits at the next round and comes out behind Vettel, but Hamilton then makes a tire action to the tires which leaves the Ferrari driver inside free at the risk of defending himself after defending the third corner.
Max Verstappen started off the back grid and was in seventh place after the first round of his 21st birthday.
He then got ahead for most of the race and didn't change the tires to target a quick finish and bypassed Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He then went into the pit at the 44th round but couldn't increase his speed for the next eight rounds when Raikkonen was in fourth place.
A tough day for Valtteri who's been doing good racing all weekend and being a gentleman lets me intercept.
The team has done a great job of winning first and second place," said Hamilton.
That's not a good language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting Saturday at a woman's insistence that she not divulge a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing future Agong Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault charges.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not give a direct answer to the testimony given before the Senate Justice Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate showed people "violence and ugly and lying."
"One thing can happen and a wonderful thing happened a few days ago in the Senate, when you saw anger, when you saw people who were angry and cruel and ugly and lying," he said.
"When you look at the exposure and the leak and they say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document--"oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
All right, wait a minute.
Did we leak...No, we didn't leak it," he added, by making the senator's facial expressions.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I'm not hiding the allegations of Dr. Ford, I'm not leaking the story," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He told me to keep it as difficult and I kept it as difficult as asked."
But the woman's denial was disliked by the president, who commented at the assembly on Saturday: "I'm telling you, that's a bad language of gestures.
Maybe he didn't do that, but that's the worst motion language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Agong Court, who had been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to achieve their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see, the atrocities, the bluntness, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrificed to gain power and control," Mediaite reported the president saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer netted a goal for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee's star redeemed the Elite League's defeat for Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 return match at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with two goals through punches than Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie finalized the home position before Dwyer recovered the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals rather than Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed a win for them.
This is the third Elite League defeat for the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from the bottom to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Opening for Dwyer arrived in the fourth minute at 3:35 of Kendall McFaull's assistance, with David Rutherford providing assistance while Beauvillier doubled the advance four minutes later.
With what looked like a busy opening time, Sullivan raised the host's eyes at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became assistant to the Cownie equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won the match during the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first time.
The host side then regrouped and Bouchard once again equalled the score at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the first win in a passing match in the second and she ensures the victory with a fifth in the middle of the last time.
Giants, who have lost four out of five matches are at home, Milton Keynes for the next match on Friday.
A Sacrificed Air Traffic Guard to Ensure Weights on board an Airship Releases Earthquakes
Air Traffic Control in Indonesia is considered a hero after death after ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers successfully took off.
Over 800 people were killed and many were lost after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to strike the area and many are trapped in the ruins of Palu City.
Although his companion escaped, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan the Great, refused to leave his control of the control tower in a strong battlement at Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport, Palu.
He did not leave to ensure Air Batik's 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then plunged out of the control tower when he felt the tower was about to collapse.
She later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We set up helicopters from Balikpapan in Borneo to take her to a larger hospital in another city.
Too bad we lost it this morning before the helicopter got to the hammer.
"Our hearts are broken listening to this news," he added.
Meanwhile authorities are concerned the number of deaths could reach thousands with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is still rising because many bodies are still under the rubble as well as many who are unreachable," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The 6-meter high tide has destroyed the Hammer which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft will bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother told, Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings back a body.
Clean water is hard to come by.
Small shops are speared everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Chairman of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross organization rushed to provide assistance to survivors but we had no idea what to find there.
It's certainly a tragedy, but things can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to the transfer.
You ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia had been hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok sacrificing over 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a passenger went missing after the plane crashed
The airline that ran the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagun in Micronesia now says, a passenger is missing, after saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely removed from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a broadcast that since Saturday afternoon, the company has been uncertain of the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said the company was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately for further details about the passengers, such as age and attention.
The local boat helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed on water during an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the actual sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed on a lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses felt that the plane had missed the runway.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane went onto the runway in a low state.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers made it across water as high as the waist to the emergency door of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were in a panic and screaming, and he just got a minor head injury.
The navy of As said, the adjacent crew on the recovered dock also provided assistance by using a resurfaced boat to move passengers to shore before the plane sank into 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Flight Security Network gave 111 people have been killed in a PNG-registered plane crash in the last two decades but none involving Air Niugini.
Analysts gave the timeline the night the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors restated Saturday's case in a re-discussion of the man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligent analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cell phone records to organize the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and his 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he was killed.
Rowlett said he received some location data from several cell phones that indicate Tellis was with Chambers on the afternoon of his death, contradicting previous allegations, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed his cell phone along with Chambers' phone when he claimed along with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth, that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "cheating because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Trellis said he knew Chambers two weeks before the woman's death.
Cell phone records show that they knew each other for only a week.
Rowlett said after the Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted the text of the Chamber's call and contact information from his phone.
"He has erased the woman from her life," said Hale.
The defense attorney is scheduled to start the closing argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be in the jury late that afternoon.

Another black one?!
NY nanny sued the couple who fired her because of the "racist" text
The New York nanny sued the couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving the wrongly sent text from the mother who complained that she was "another black person."
The pair denied them racists, equating the act of clamoring as "extor."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"NO KKKKKKKK ANOTHER WRITES THE BLACK," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the text.
She wanted to send the text to her husband, instead she had sent the message to Maurice, twice.
Upon realizing his guilt, Plasco-Flaxman who felt "uncomfortable" had fired Maurice, and said that his previous nanny, an African-American, had not done a good job and he expected the presence of a governess from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice sued the couple for compensation for the dismissal, and demanded compensation in $350 a day for six months, compensation for the residence he had been offered, even though there was no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have retaliated against claims that they were racists, saying that the act of ending Maurice's service was natural because they felt that she could not be trusted after offending the woman.
"My wife sent me something she didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But are you going to put your child's care on someone you've been abusive, even if it's a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
It's not."
Regarding the threat as "insurgency", Plasco said his wife had just had two months to give birth to a child and was in a "secret situation."
"You want to wear someone in such a situation?
It's not a good thing," added the investment banker.
During the case, public opinion courts quickly condemned the couple on social media, assaulting them on their actions and logic.
Paddington Publishers are worried that readers are having trouble getting in touch with the talking bear, new letters reveal
Bond's son, Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was received, said of the letter: "It is hard to put oneself in the state of the person who reads the book first before the book is published.
It's a shame when we now know about Paddington's success."
He said, his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before inspiring to write children's books, a little toy bear, was optimistic about his job being rejected, she added, the 60th anniversary of publishing the book as a "sweet pea" after his father's death last year.
About Paddington, he described as "the most important member of our family," he added, his father was proud of his success in the end.
"The father of a quiet man, he is not a big talker," she said.
"But, since Paddington is too alive for him, as is the feeling you have a son who achieves something you're proud of even though it's not what you do.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Even though the bear was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself."
My son is dying and I need to say goodbye over the phone.
Upon landing, the daughter was sent to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, Nice hastily where the doctor had worked his best to save her life.
"Nad called me frequently to say that things are bad and he won't be saved," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, baby.
I'll be by your side soon enough.
I'll be with you.
The medicine the doctor gave to pump his heart slowly out and leave his system.
He died before his time and this is all turned off.
I just sat there and waited, knowing this was gonna happen.
I could not scream or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold back."
At last Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in, saddened by the loss of her son, got on a plane with another passenger - who had no idea of the bitter experience she had had.
"No one knows," he said.
"I bow my head, and tears flow at all times.
It was difficult to describe, but on this trip I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her."
A sad woman sent a postcard to avoid killing herself on the bridge.
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide, working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have broadcast a letter on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to contact for support.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any mother to feel as I feel every day," he said.
Davis, aged 45, lives in Lydney, says his son is a potential cook with a contagious smile.
"Everyone recognizes him by his smile.
They always said his smile could turn any room on."
However, he quit his job before he died, because he was in "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother found his brother after his brother committed suicide.
Davis said: "I'm worried constantly if this is going to cause any other effect."
Davis created the card, "to inform people that there are people you can meet and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't just sit there quietly - you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her spouse for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
"He didn't tell me who he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his behavior.
She was very sad on Christmas - when the kids opened their presents, she didn't look at them or anything."
He said the death of his spouse was a great trauma to them, but they had to pass him by: "It made a big hole in the family.
It's making us split up.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hung when the FBI began its investigation.
"I think, if we can get what he wants--limited time investigations, limited scopes--we can bring to the unit," said Flake on Sunday, adding that the committee "crash--trouble" in a stalemate based on faith that has taken root.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their refusal is due to timing.
Mid-term elections in just five weeks, and on November 6th - if as expected, Republicans' decisions were unsatisfactory, they would grow weaker to get the person they want to appoint for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush had made a call to the Senators, lobbying them supporting Kavanaugh, who had worked at the White House for Bush and through Bush had found his wife Ashley, who became Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI puts together a report?
The vote will be run in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are convened.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate seat, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to equalise the series and confirm his position in the Agong Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'down' down Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, according to the South Korean legislature.
Park Byeong-seug, collecting data from the Southern unification ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - covered with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the high levels imposed by smugglers are a major factor.
Pyongyang did not give any public reviews.
Most of North Korea's defectors will be offered South Korea's skills.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the 1953 Korean War.
Most of them fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Independent Zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants not political fugitives and often sends them back by force.
Relations between the North and the South - technically still at war - have improved since the last few months.
Earlier this month, the heads of both nations met in Pyongyang for a discussion that centered on the latest nuclear power acceleration negotiations.
This is after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in a general sense to head towards nuclear-free on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. partition of delaying negotiations since the incident.
"Without any trust from the U.S., our national security is not secure and therefore, we will not initiate nuclear disarmament first," Ri said in his speech at the Grand Assembly of the United Nations, New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "emotion," and it's not appropriate to sit on the Agong Court.
Council Minority Chairman Nancy Pelosi called Agong Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "emotional" and said, his conduct was not appropriate to hold a position in Mahlamah Agong.
Pelosi made the following review in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe if a woman behaves that way, they will say the woman is 'emotional,'" Pelosi said of the reaction to Kavanaugh's description before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has angrily denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both teenagers.
At the opening, Kavanaugh got emotional, sometimes almost screaming and crying when discussing family and when he was in high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "extreme and premeditated defamation" run by still angry liberal Hilary Clinton killed in the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he was unfit to take office at the Agong Court, as it showed that he was partially opposed to Democrats.
"I felt he had eliminated his own qualifications and his actions against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitates when asked whether he will try to prosecute Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrat gets a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I would say this -- if he hadn't spoken the truth to Congress and the FBI, he didn't deserve to hold a position in the Agong Court, but only in the court which he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Court of Rayuan Circuit
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision against the Able Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was called a conservative court.
In a confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering whether he would change the decision of the Agong Court.
"This is no time for an emotional, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'what fun,'" said Pelosi.
And women need to show it.
It's a reasonable nista word, an inflammation that months and years abound, and he doesn't endure anger without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't feel it's anything extraordinary, do you agree?"
He continued, "I was helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who said she also cried when she was angry, but had invented a technique, if she felt angry and started crying, she would say to the person she spoke to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
Then he went on.
And I think that's a brilliant suggestion."
Crying is allowed as a way to channel anger because it's always misunderstood.
One of the most unforgettable memories of the old work, in the office dominated by men, I found myself weeping with inexhaustible rage, I was pulled by an older woman at the neck - a cold manager whom I was terrified of - pulling me into the stairwell.
"Don't show them your cries," he told me.
"They don't know who you are.
They think you are sad and will be happy to succeed in making you sad."
Patricia Schroeder, a former female congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested having an affair in a boat called Monkey Business out of the competition, Ms. Schroeder, disappointed, felt there was no reason to stop him from joining the presidential campaign.
"It wasn't a carefully planned decision," he said laughing at me 30 years later.
"There are seven more candidates competing and they don't need another candidate.
Some call Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""
Because of the events at the end of the campaign, the woman was left behind in an attempt to set up a tube, and she vowed not to compete as long as she didn't get $2 million.
It's a futile struggle.
He finds that his supporters who give $1,000 to men will give him only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" he said.
When he spoke out that he would not launch a formal campaign, he felt various feelings - grateful to those who supported him, disappointed by the system that troubled him from asking for donations and who targeted voters instead of candidates, and angry at sexism - and he felt secure.
"You'd think I had a broken soul," Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to him.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember when I thought about it, what would I put on my nesan rock?
"She's crying?""
The U.S.-China Trade War may benefit Beijing
The initial explosion of the Trade War between the U.S. and China may be baffling, and although the battle is not yet over, the dispute between these two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, has issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing on Chinese exports including solar, iron and aluminum panels.
The most significant increase occurred this week at a new rate that would affect $200 billion (£150 billion) of item value, the effect of which is like taxing on half the stuff that goes into the US from China.
Beijing countered the same way every time, recently, at a rate of five to ten percent over 60 billion American goods.
China has vowed to repay every U.S. for action, and the world's second-largest economy is not impressed.
To get Washington to retreat means to submit to the will of the U.S., but ducking to the U.S. is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
According to experts, if Beijing plays cards right, the U.S. Trade War pressure can support China positively in the long run by lowering the .compliance between the two countries.
"The political decision is fast by whether Washington or Beijing can initiate an uncontrollable economic state in any country and looks more dangerous than any previous observer understands," Abigail Grace said, a felow of research that focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of thinkers.
Syria is 'prepared' for the return of political escapees, said the Foreign Minister
Syria says the country is ready for the voluntary return of the country's political escapees and begs for help to rebuild a country devastated by the seven-year war.
Speaking at the United Nations Agong Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said, the state of the country is improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made to combat violence," he said.
The government will continue to restore areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore order.
Circumstances are now prepared for the voluntary return of refugees, to the country they were forced to leave because of the violence and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their search points.
The United Nations estimates over 5.5 million Syrian nationals have fled since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in that country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regim would welcome help to build that ruined country.
But he insisted that the country would not receive conditional assistance or assistance from a country that supported the rebellion.

We're doing everything we can.
Congratulations Thomas.
He's a good captain.
