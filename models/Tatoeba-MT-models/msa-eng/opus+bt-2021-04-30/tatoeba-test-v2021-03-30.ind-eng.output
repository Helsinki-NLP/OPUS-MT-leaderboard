Like father, like son.
Some of my friends speak English well.
Tom pointed to the floor.
Lately he's been a very good man.
He's from France.
Tom knows he heard something.
Health is more valuable than gold.
I would be happy to help him.
Learning about foreign cultures is fun.
When did you start wearing lenses?
Tom is not going to like that answer.
Oh, really?
I thought you were trying to reach us earlier.
Undaunted, he refused to surrender.
I'm trying to write about ethnicity and minority religion.
I must have made a mistake.
I met an old friend of mine.
The knife was so blunt that it couldn't be used to cut meat, I ended up using my pocket knife.
He's blind next door.
I just don't feel safe here anymore.
Tom is forgetful.
Where have you been?
Traffic lights are used to regulate traffic.
Don't let Tom see these pictures.
This room gets a little sunshine.
He's painting a picture.
I shouldn't have run that red light.
Bring me a bucket of water.
I used to stay up all night.
It smells so bad.
A sentence is a sentence.
There is no god but God and Muhammad is the messenger of God.
Just yesterday I found out.
You can buy it at the bookstore.
Let's take the Intercity-Express train.
Thank you very much.
Yes!
My brother loves music.
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Going home?
No one cares about our problems.
What's wrong with you?
I thought I could come by this afternoon.
"It's not in vain that we wait two hours." "Yes, it's a signature I'll keep for the rest of my life."
Tom was one of my friends.
Tom sent me thirty more messages yesterday.
I was just telling Tom what Mary told me.
There's sugar, there's ants.
You'll never find your way home, through a narrow rocky road.
Tom really wasn't home when we came to visit him.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
The man was driving a car.
The birthday card crack is coming up soon.
Please read it one more time.
When can you do that?
I'm just kidding.
Tom almost got hit.
I'm going too.
Love is never wrong.
That's what I'm looking for.
That fee already included payments for professional services to complete the survey.
You don't really want to learn a logogram, do you?
Tom tries to persuade Mary to help him.
Two things are not related.
How could I not realize this?
What's this called?
I stayed home because it was raining.
That's the right answer.
In general, men run faster than women.
For me, there is no fundamental difference between the cultures of the two countries.
He's having an affair.
Wake me up at eight o'clock.
Tell me why he's not here.
That's probably what affected their decision.
The rain lasted for an entire night.
Tom's getting jealous.
Let me take you home.
Isn't that awful?
I'll buy this bag for you.
The cake's too sweet.
I pushed Mary into the water.
Have you ever been to London?
It's our responsibility to help.
How was the party?
I'm not ready.
Mary declined an invitation to the concert.
When are you coming home?
He's sitting around his grandchildren.
The boy fell asleep in his bed.
Jim's still not used to driving to the left of the road.
He's focused on the puzzle.
The man passed away a few hours ago.
Want to go eat with me?
This feels like a dream to me.
I just ate.
We know that the front door is locked.
May I speak with Mr. Sato?
This water doesn't smell.
Mr. Smith is an acquaintance.
Thank you for your interest.
We got a big problem.
I really don't understand you.
He's afraid to fly by plane.
I had suspected that he was lying, but that didn't surprise me.
I don't have a choice, I have to do this.
I can't finish reading this thick book in a week.
The timing was very important.
Tom, are you okay?
We have a lot of furniture.
Health is more important than gold.
I don't think you have a choice.
I'm not sure what else to do.
We've done everything we can.
Are there any more questions?
You'll never be alone.
When I walked along this road, I met a woman.
Don't you speak English?
Before the law we are all aligned, but the rich sometimes have more advantage.
He's gonna make it.
I love cats.
The meeting was over at nine o'clock.
Tom is mentally disturbed.
Could I be crazy?
We had a very difficult winter.
I have to ask, don't I?
Let's find a solution that everyone can accept.
Everyone makes mistakes.
You better tell Tom not to do it.
My mom's been gone ten years.
Nobody's perfect.
Please go and call for help.
Six degrees below zero.
Where are they?
Leave me alone!
I lost my wallet.
There's nothing wrong with the car, it's just that you can't drive.
May I see your coupons?
He looks serious reading.
Tom married an easier woman than he did.
He's a copy of his father.
He has nice words to insult himself.
Maybe I'm fat, but I'm excited.
He tried to kill himself but in the end he failed.
Do you guys have any light beer?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
If I were reincarnation, I'd want to be reborn as a cat.
We got a lot of rain this summer.
He made an important scientific discovery.
He's a student.
Tom's already here, but Bill's still not here.
Laurie's slim.
They advised him to go alone.
Tom was a good man.
I'll call you back in 20 minutes.
They're swimming.
What's your name?
Brian went to school with Kate.
Why did you stop?
Tom tricked Mary.
No less than 40 percent of the students went on to further education to the university.
Tom put his pencil on the table.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Tom lowers his voice so that no one can hear him.
You see anything?
What are you looking at?
Does he have long hair?
He greets her every morning, as she enters the school building.
I thought he was a doctor.
The descent is very steep, better through the left.
We didn't really see the crash.
Her mother's worried about her son.
What opera is being demonstrated at Lincoln Center right now?
I feel tired.
Tom killed Mary.
The data is often inaccurate.
Get up!
We've ordered the six thirty o'clock.
We named the dog Tim.
He opened the letter quickly.
Where's the train station?
Tom hints Mary to follow him.
It's eleven o'clock.
I'm smarter than them.
The sky's getting darker.
I'm tired.
Everyone who knew him admired him.
We really need your help.
We have to keep working.
The train just left.
Those people are crazy!
