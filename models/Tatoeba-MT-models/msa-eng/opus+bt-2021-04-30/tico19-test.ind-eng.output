Cumulative incidents of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which increased rapidly in the European Union/Economic Region of Europe and the United Kingdom, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incident of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) showed a similar trend in the European Union/Economic Region of Europe and the United Kingdom which confirmed that, despite its different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic developed very quickly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase its readiness for a surge of COVID-19 patients who will require health care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a case cluster of pneumonia with unidentified etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the disease's causative agent is a new coronavirus now called coronavirus heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date suggests that about 80% of COVID-19 sufferers have a mild disease, which is a breath duct infection with or without pneumonia, with most of these sufferers recovering.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 developed into a heavier disease and required hospital care, while 6% of other cases suffered critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalised as a result of COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we reviewed the trend of COVID-19 cumulative incidents of European Union/EU/EEA and UK (UK) countries and compared them to incidents in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of current COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries to the number of cases in Italy during January 31–24, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 experienced further geographical spread and dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world today following pandemic dynamics in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
At the Eurosurveillance 2020 issue of March 5, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with a confirmed COVID-19 case based on the WHO case definition.
In EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 on people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
By 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected across 30 EU/EEA and Ingris United Kingdom (UK) countries, between December 31, 2019 and March 15, 2020 with that date including, there were 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting cumulative numbers and cumulative incidents of COVID-19 cases
In the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases notified of every country worldwide is updated daily at 8.00 p.m. This number is obtained only from official sources such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to assess COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK, as well as compare it to trends in Italy.
As the prevalence proxy of the COVID-19 case is active, we count the 14-day beheaded cumulative incidents, so take into account the natural travel of COVID-19, in every EU/EEA and UK country, in the period of January 1–15, 2020.
We also present cumulative numbers of cases notified of each country until 15 March 2020 at 8.00 compared to the Italian case during the period 31 January – 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
The 14-day cumulative incident trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries generally follows trends in Hubei Province (Tiongkok) (Image 1).
For EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the COVID-19 cumulative incident began to rise around 21 February, then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (additional reserves).
This trend was mainly moved by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar trend of increased COVID-19 cumulative incidents (additional reserves).
Image 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period of 31 January – 15 March 2020.
The data highlights that, up to 15 March at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases comparable to the total number of Italian cases three weeks earlier or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases notified is increasing rapidly in EU/EEA and UK.
The trend observed at the COVID-19 cumulative incident hinted that the pandemic increased at comparable speeds in all countries.
This is regardless of the stage differences that countries experience, variations in public health responses, and possible differences in case definitions between countries and differences in protocols to select patients who must be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, which includes follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the impacted Italian region explained the situation of about 10% of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in this region had reached its maximum capacity.
Currently, COVID-19 case admission data in hospitals and/or intensive care units at EU/EAA levels are only available for 6% and 1% of cases (data is not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the death toll.
Studies conducted in 2010-2011 showed great variation in terms of the availability of intensive care beds and madya care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or fewer resources compared to Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and madya care per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
Modeling scenarios related to saturation of health care capacity, with prevalence estimation of COVID-19 cases hospitalised for each EU/EEA and UK country related to risk >90% beyond intensive care bed capacity, are provided at the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment of COVID-19.
Because so far cases are clustered in certain areas of EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals as well as intensive care units usually serve certain regional service coverage populations, information about cases and intensive care beds is best provided at the District Unit Naming Level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic developed very quickly in EU/EEA and UK.
Therefore, the state, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare for SARS-CoV-2 community transmission scenarios and increasing the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, particularly intensive care, as occurs in the impacted region of Italy.
As shown in recent ECDC rapid risk assessments, a fast, proactive, and comprehensive approach is essential to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, by transitioning from a damming approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid number of cases increases, as anticipated, may not give sufficient time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt proper responses if it is not applied beforehand.
Such rapid risk assessments also list public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Available short window of opportunity as the country has the possibility of further improving its control efforts in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEA state health care system will likely face a surge in patients requiring intensive care within the next few days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, which causes disaster for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is more contagious and more about the elderly than young people, and more about men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on this newly emerging disease, this article tries to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the subject of fast-growing research.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this review will help us to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese ordered to stay home during the holidays and a few weeks after due to a new viral outbreak.
The virus is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) which caused an outbreak of heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it caused was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with over 40,000 patients repatriated and 3,000 patients deceased.
WHO warned that COVID-19 constitutes "enemy of public number 1" and potentially destructive more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020 which established sequences of viruses isolated from some patients, over 200 papers have been published about COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and its treatment.
This review sought to summarize research progress in this rapidly expanding field of new subjects.
As possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV diseases, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what has been learned so far regarding prevention and prognosis of disease as well as some other questions that have not been answered, but are urgent.
Based on tradition, CoV is considered a nonletal pathogen for humans, mainly causing about 15% of colds 4.
Nevertheless, in this century, we have encountered CoVs that are highly pathogenic to humans twice, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing a plague that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is currently the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the pneumonia cluster with unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, CoV sequences were launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, a health care provider infection was reported, which hinted that human-to-human transmission might occur.
On 23 January, quarantine of the region was imposed in the city of Wuhan and the entire public transport was halted.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients directly contacting the Wuhan seafood market were considered the initial locations of infections from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Gbr. 2).2).
As the situation progresses very quickly, final coverage and severity of the outbreak must still be established.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter study on 8,866 patients, which includes 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more updated picture of the following epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people at all ages, but especially at 30–65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected are over 50 years old, few are under 20 years old, and only 14 infected people are under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0.31/100,000) compared to women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 extends in clusters, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from awitan to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time ranging from awitan to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproduction figures (R0) are 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 adjusted 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, according to the massive transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
Patient mortality with confirmed cases of 1.44% (95% CI: 1,10-1.86%) and customized mortality for all patients at 3.06% (95% CI: 2,02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (man), age (−60), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of large knotted viruses containing a single strand of RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four genus, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, with alpha- and beta-CoV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein bulges or spikes (S) covers bond with their cell receptors, angiotensin exchange enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA is accompanied by the cover glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid protein forms a vesicle containing the virion, which then undergoes fusion with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with genetic similarities over 99.98% among 10 samples sequenced; the sample was taken from the site of the origin of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV compared to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the epithelium of very thin human breath ducts.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as was SARS-CoV.
Nevertheless, S SARS-CoV-2 proteins bond with human ACE2 are weaker than their bond with S SARS-CoV protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes infections that are not as severe as SARS-CoV infections in patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form new short proteins encoded with orf3b and proteins secreted with orf8 passwords.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a complete human cryo-EM ACE2 structure at a 2.9 Å resolution in complex with B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that complexes, which have open and closed conformations, are arranged to form dimers and complexes of ACE2-B0AT1 can bind two S proteins, which are evidence for the introduction and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be made a therapeutic target in drug filtering to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infections.
The host's origin and intermediary
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to come from bats and are each transmitted to humans through weasels and camels.
Through SARS-CoV-2's phylogenetic comparison with other CoVs, bats are considered to be the original hosts of SARS-CoV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helps the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans is still unknown, and the transmission route still has to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed snakes as carriers of viruses from bats to humans involving homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, proposed that the grind, a long-monching mammal ant eater often used in traditional Chinese medicine, potentially an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology on CoV found in grinders and SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, 1% of the differences scattered throughout the genome are still a huge difference; therefore, conclusive results as concrete evidence have still not been obtained (Gbr. 3).
The physicalochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive to ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidin, effectively disabled the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to this new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have yet reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to other previous CoV researches, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).4).
In general, after invading the host, the virus is recognised by the innate immune system through the pattern recognition receptor (PRR), which includes C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell maturation, and type I interferon synthesis (IFN) that limits virus spread and accelerates viral antigen phagocytosis by macrophages.
However, the N protein on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune response.
Soon, adaptive immune responses joined the battle against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies that are specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
The helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
Nevertheless, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by inducing apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunities, which include complements, such as C3a and C5a, as well as antibodies are also important in resisting viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from cured patients neutralize MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce large amounts of locally free radicals, which can cause severe damage to lungs and other organs, and, at worst, fail compound organs and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is marked by an awitan cluster, is more about the elderly with a sycophant disease and pregnant women.
Generally, people exposed to large amounts of viruses or whose immune function is impaired have a higher chance of being infected than others.
The estimation of the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on studies of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period was 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
Newer studies, as described above, show that the incubation period of 4.8 (3,0-7,2) days based on the demographic 8,866 cases.
It is important that health authorities adjust quarantine timing effectively based on the incubation period is most accurate so as to prevent infected people, but without symptoms, transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to the virus or infected are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine time be extended by 24 days?
Fever is often a symptom of major and early COVID-19, with or without other symptoms such as dry cough, asphyxiation, muscle pain, limbo, headaches, sore throat, rinorean, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experience dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after awitan disease.
In heavy cases, patient disease development proceeds rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, although without lung imaging disorders, must be filtered against the virus for early diagnosis.
The demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilator support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies, namely studies on family clusters and clusters caused by transmission from asymtomatic people.
In comparison to that, demographic studies in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients require ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher MERS letality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) are also observable in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were shown to be major symptoms and ventilation support was required for about 14%-20% of patients.
Until 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on demographic studies in June 2012, mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached as high as 6.47 with a trust interval (CI) of 95% at 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV ranged only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality, and R0 is given at Table 1.
The figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has higher spreading capabilities than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but not as deadly as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Therefore, the challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is greater than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
The clustered awitans are often found in one family or from one gathering or vehicle such as cruise ships.
Patients often have a travel history or live in Wuhan or other impacted areas or contact with infected people or patients in the past two weeks before awitans.
However, it was reported that people could carry the virus without showing symptoms over two weeks and patients being returned from the hospital could carry the virus again.
In the early stages, the patient has a normal or decreased peripheral white blood cell count (specifically lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and increased aminotransferase and viremia levels were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The enzyme levels of liver and muscle as well as myoglobin increase in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and blood deposit rates increase in most patients.
In patients with heavy cases, D-dimer levels increase, which is the fibrin decommissioning product that's in the blood, and lymphocytes count down progressively.
The thorax photo abnormalities are found in as large COVID-19 patients and are marked by bilateral cloudy shadows or ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often suffer from onician pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute breathing syndrome (ARDS).
As ARDS occurs, uncontrollable inflammatory, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis greatly aggravate gas exchange disorders.
Type I and type II pneumocyte dysfunction decreases surfactin levels and increases surface pressure thus lowering the lung's ability to expand and increase the risk of lung collapse.
Hence, the worst findings in thorax photos are often parallel to the most severe level of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first COVID-19 pathological analysis showed pneumocyte desquamation, formation of hialin membranes, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, as well as heavily cored synsitial cells in the lungs of patients who died of this disease, according to viral infection pathology and ARDS as well as similar to pathological analysis of SARS and MERS patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through the reaction of the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain (RT-PCR) is used as the primary criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high level of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Hence, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and a must to make an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's group explained the protocol of using SHERLOCK-based CRISPR techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects fragments of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA at 20 × 10-18 moles/L to 200 × 10-18 moles/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using a dip stick in less than an hour without requiring elaborate instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly increase sensitivity and ease if verified in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors mainly offer support care to COVID-19 patients, while trying various therapies that have been used or proposed before for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).2).
This therapy includes current and potential therapies with antivirus drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from cured patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from cured patients is proposed for use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs expressing ACE2 in lower levels, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential for relieving symptoms and saving lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms must be supported with oxygenation of the extractorporeum membrane (ECMO), which is a modified cardiopulmonary shortcut technique used for treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolyte balancing, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, as well as protection of vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune system reactions are known to result in cytokine storms in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response marked by release of a series of cytokines, which include TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals that are the main causes of ARDS and fail compound organs.
Immunosuppression is essential in the handling of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Korticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to deal with cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppression handling for cytokine storms includes immune response modulation directed by T cells; blockage of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine 4; signal suppressor and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, are widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high doses are useless for heavy lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
In contrast, steroids can result in heavy side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which strongly influence prognosis.
Nevertheless, short corticosteroids at low to moderate doses are recommended to be carefully administered to critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing this review, no effective antivirus therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous giving of remdesivir, an analogue of nucleotides, is found to be beneficial in an American patient of COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antivirus drug developed by Gilead, originally for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed inhibition of other single strand RNA viruses, which included MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead provided this compound for China to conduct a series of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results were greatly awaited.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other side reactions can occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these therapies with other medications used by patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from cured patients and antibody-making.
There is a long history of blood collection of cured patients from infectious diseases to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy people from contracting the disease.
True, cured patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) that B lymphocytes produce to fight pathogens as well as other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules in pathogens, and immediately neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of cured patients from COVID-19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improve in 24 hours, accompanied by decreased inflammatory and viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification need to be done to submit the method for large-scale use before specific therapies are developed.
Furthermore, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma - related flaws must be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune responses and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low and plasma is needed in large quantities to care for critically ill patients.
Development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic is difficult to do.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify genetic codes that encode antibodies effectively or perform effective antibody filtering against proteins that are important to viruses.
In this way, we can easily increase the scale of antibody production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, the effect depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula.
Most effective components are still unknown or unclear because they are difficult to extract or verify that component or its optimal combination.
Currently, because effective and specific therapies for COVID-19 do not exist yet, TCM is becoming one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for people recovering from severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule are found to be effective for COVID-19 therapy.
The top cure rate in COVID-19 patient therapy is observable in some Chinese provinces that use TCM in 87% of its patients, which includes Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which uses TCM at only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very rough because many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, must be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends plubicated a study comparing western drug therapy (WM) alone to combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time required for body temperature recovery, symptom loss, and inpatient care was very much shorter in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone.
More impressively, the hunting rate of symptoms (from mild to heavy) is much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (7.4% compared to 46.2%) and the mortality lower in the WM+TCM group compared to the WM group alone (8.8% compared to 39%).
Nevertheless, TCM's efficacy and security are still awaiting better controlled trials on a larger scale and in more research centers.
Another interesting thing is to characterize the working mechanism and clarify effective components in TCM therapy or its combination, if possible.
Most of the suspected or confirmed patients of COVID-19 feel very much fear of this highly contagious and even deadly disease, and the quarantined person also feels boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infections such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as side effects of insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to greater anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phases of the SARS outbreak, a series of psychiatric morbidities, which included depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor turmoil, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even switchidality were once reported.
Tracking of contact history and mandatory quarantine, as part of a public health response to COVID-19 outbreaks, can make people more anxious and feel guilty regarding the effects of transmission, quarantine, and stigma about relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspected persons, and people in contact with them, as well as the needy general public.
Psychological support must include the formation of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, and therapy plans as well as the use of devices and professional electronic applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for severing transmission chains from animal and human reservoirs infected to vulnerable hosts and are often complementary to antivirus therapy in controlling epidemics caused by the occurrence of viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines, which are long-term and effectively making neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live-weakened vaccines have been evaluated in experimental animals.
Nevertheless, this vaccine candidate's in vivo efficacy in the elderly and its model of lital challenge and protection against zoonotic viral infections must still be determined before clinical studies begin.
This may be because SARS subsided 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
Instead, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
A vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS by using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and has partly been evaluated in experimental animals.
The development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that are safe and effective for non-immunes is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, these difficulties were not easily overcome due to the long time to develop vaccines (an average of 18 months) and dynamic CoV variations.
As a new disease, COVID-19 is just beginning to show its full clinical journey in thousands of patients.
In most cases the patient can gradually recover without a sequela.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with heavy cases.
Hence, the formation of disease prognosis models is essential for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors can influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly occurs at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50 in studies containing 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care tend to have combidity and complications and are significantly older than patients who do not need intensive care (median age 66 compared to 51), which signals age as a prognostic factor for COVID-19 patient outcomes.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidity and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care have more likely acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events also provide a major reason for death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to also bond with colangiocytes with ACE2-positive, which can result in liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that the underlying ages and diseases are highly correlated and can influence each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein rate (CRP) in blood reflects inflammatory severity or tissue injury and is proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation between CRP levels and severity as well as COVID-19 prognosis has also been proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), aminotransferase alanin (ALT), and creatin kinase (CK) can also help predict final results.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and released during tissue damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are traditional markers for heart and liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Photos of thorax and development of temporal clinical symptoms should be considered along with other things to predict final outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: As described above, steroids are widely used immunosuppressants as a support therapy for infection diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high dose corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of the disease eventually suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disabilities and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and short periods of time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients suffer from tremendous stress because they must undergo extreme long-term quarantine and uncertainty as well as witness the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long - term support must be provided to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have a different epidemiological picture than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or symptomless symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the cold.
Therefore, in the early phases or times of incubation, infected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activity, which poses great difficulty to control epidemics.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when patients are seriously ill and most do not occur in the initial phase.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, major efforts are being made in China, which includes quarantine of the Wuhan region and surrounding cities as well as ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of severing the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although these actions are very damaging to the economy and to other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating an epidemic slowdown.
The most optimistic estimation states the outbreak will end in March and the phase of decline lasts for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter et al. confirmed that COVID-19, which seems to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the final outcome of the epidemic and stated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
The Canadian research group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the mid-konka wipe and throat of a patient who had already recovered and returned home from the hospital 2 weeks earlier. this indicated that a re-identifiable virus could be a recurring episode, similar to influenza.
Nevertheless, promising signs occur in China, when viewed based on a decrease in the number of new cases, which suggests that current strategies may be successful.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause a million cases with half the deaths as well.
However, with quarantine and strict isolation, the disease could eventually be controlled.
Perhaps also, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappears or becomes a virus not very pathogenic that can coexist with humans.
Comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with SARS and MERS epidemics is given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted through coughing or sneezing, and may also be through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in the fuses that gave rise to a possible new transmission, which is a fuse-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may have been caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, careful precautions must be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even those who happen to be in contact with patients or infected people.
The first defensive line that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of facial masks, both surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (an 1860s serial number) helping control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks keep potentially infected people from being airborne or from sticking to the surface of the material, where the spit splash can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (serial numbers of the 1860s) can protect against virion inhalation with sizes as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virion can completely penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in terms of size, both measuring about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked into one, health care providers who contact directly with patients must wear N95 (an 1860s serial number) and not a surgical mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers must wear fitting isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eye.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he was wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflammation of the eye.
Hence, health care providers must also wear a face - to - face shield or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in impacted or potentially impacted areas, it is highly recommended for everyone to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay home for self - quarantine, and avoid contact with potentially infected people.
A three-foot distance is believed to be appropriate for maintaining distance from the patient.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection as well as preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should be a major warning for China that has strong memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
Nevertheless, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control calmed the population by saying that the new virus has low dispersal properties and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and prevention and containment of the disease is not a problem.
This message greatly calmed public fears, especially while the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, so this critical time was missed to stem the still small-scale disease in Wuhan.
The disease control agency in China should learn from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because each word is noticed by the population and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinicians than to wait for official reports from doctors or authorized officers; (3) be more restrictive to stem the potential for epidemics in the early stages, and not to try to calm the public; and (4) be more often issued targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness of disease epidemics and test and improve the community response system periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began spreading in late December 2019.
In less than 2 months, the outbreak has spread throughout China and over 50 countries in the world at the time of the writing of this review.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and COVID-19 and SARS symptoms are similar, COVID-19 outbreaks give the impression of SARS outbreak repeating itself.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to stem epidemics and deal with patients.
COVID-19 is more about the elderly than young people and more about men than women, as well as the mortality rate is also higher in the elderly than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit viruses even when they are without symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit viruses when they are seriously ill.
This explains in part the reason SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA relays to examine SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can give more positive results against virus screening.
These findings greatly increased the risk of spreading the virus.
With the progress of COVID-19 research so quickly, some important issues still have to be solved, namely:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although there's a 96% genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like COVs, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What kind of animal is an intermediate species to transmit the virus from the host of origin, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to 1 and 2, we can't cut off transmission effectively and the plague can spread back at any time.
While molecular modeling and biochemical acidization show that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the breath duct cells and result in subsequent pathological changes?
Is this virus also linked to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a quick and accurate diagnosis as well as effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How did the virus develop genetically during transmission between humans?
Is this pandemic going to be a worldwide pandemic, ending up like SARS, or repeating it periodically like the flu?
The answer to the above question and many other statements is vital, but it may take time to find them.
Nonetheless, whatever the price, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible in order to return to normal life.
The origin of the zoonotic virus human corona
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved the co-evolution of the corona virus (CoV) and its host, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild diseases, such as colds.
The outbreak of heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) reversed the state and revealed how highly damaging and life-threatening HCoV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China by the end of 2019 has made the CoV a highlight back and shocked us with high transmission, but with a lower pathogenicity compared to its brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonosis, and therefore, the understanding of HCoV's zoonotic origin will benefit us.
Most HCoVs come from bats, and in these animals, viruses are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs have also been known.
Animal host identification has direct implications in the prevention of human disease.
The investigation of CoV-ing interactions in animals can also provide important insights into CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present a general picture of current knowledge of seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of its discovery as well as its zoonotic origin and interspecies transmission.
The important thing is, we're comparing and contrasting the HCoV from an evolutionary point of view and genome recombination.
The 2019 CoV disease epidemic (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
Additionally, successful host transition requirements and the implications of viral evolution in disease severity are also highlighted.
The corona virus (CoV) comes from the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of veiled, positive-inflicted, and single-stained RNA viruses.
The virus has the largest genome measuring 26 to 32 kilobasa among RNA viruses called "CoV", due to its crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Based on the structure, CoV has an unsegmented genome that has a similar setting.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large open read frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that overlap each other. both are translated into polyprotein replication of pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins undergo further processing to form 16 nonstructural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open read frame (ORF) for structural proteins, which includes bulges or spikes (S), veils or envelopes (E), membranes (M), and nucleoproteins (N).
A number of complementary proteins specific to certain lineages are also encoded by various CoV lineages.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoV is slated to be four genus (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four genus, the beta-CoV genus has the most HCoV and is divided again into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that bats and rodents are the source of most alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while poultry is the main reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed species barriers and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
To date, there are seven known human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, heavy acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or diarrhea.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower-heavy breath duct infections at relatively more patients and having a higher chance of developing into acute perbreath disorder syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the pulmonary organs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, the B814, was isolated from the ingus of patients who were cold in the mid 1960s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been collected through in-depth studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which both cause self-healing symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCoV infections were generally harmless, until the SARS outbreak occurred.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most destructive outbreaks in current history, which infects over 8,000 people with a rough death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, outbreaks of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in an epidemic sustained in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to various other parts of the world.
The new HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), subsequently called SARS-CoV-2, is a causative agent of the 2019 corona viral disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed the lives of over 3,120 people and infected over 91,000 people up to March 3, 2020.
The alarm has gone off and the world has to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCoVs all have zoonotic origins of bats, mice, or pets.
Much evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats. in bats, CoVs are well-adapted and are nonpathogenic, but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed tremendous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origin of HCoV gives the framework to understand natural history, driving power, and limiting factors of displacement between species.
The study can also guide or facilitate the search for reservoir animal hosts, intermediaries, and SARS-CoV-2 amplifiers, which have important implications in future prevention of dispersal.
In this review, we give a general picture of zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We specifically highlight and discuss the general topic that HCoV's parent virus is usually nonpathogenic in its natural reservoir, but it becomes pathogenic after interspecies transmission into the new host.
We also reviewed HCoV's evolutionary trend that increased transmission capabilities are often accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
Final results of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic are also discussed in this context.
Animal coVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of HCoV-229E the first B814 strain of ingus patients exposed to the cold, various CoVs had been isolated from various infected animals, which included turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV's discovery in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative clue.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from a patient's breath duct which had an upper breath duct infection in 1966, which was further adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed symptoms of cold, which included headaches, sneezes, lethargy, and sore throat, accompanied by fever and cough seen at 10~20% of cases.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and sequential series pathways in the still breastfeeding brain.
The clinical image of HCoV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is symtomatically indistinguishable to other respiratory tract pathogenic infections such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread worldwide and tend to be most widely transmitted during winter in temperate areas.
Typically, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week and followed by a period of illness for about 2 weeks.
Based on a human volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E have mild colds.
Few patients with weakened immune systems showed infection of the lower-heavy airway.
SARS, known also as "pneumonia atipis", was the first properly documented pandemic as a result of HCoV in human history and its etiological agent was SARS-CoV, which was the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported with 774 deaths, which were spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of super-snakes, each case is thought to cause about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the peak load of the virus seen on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced myalgia, headaches, fever, lethargy, and shivering, which was followed by dyspnea, cough, and breath disorders as advanced symptoms.
Limfopenia, abnormal liver function tests, and increased creatinal kinases are common laboratory abnormalities in SARS.
Alveolar diffusion damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages are also observable in SARS patients.
Subsequently, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that include gastrointestinal tracts, livers, and kidneys can also be infected in heavy cases, usually accompanied by cytokine storms, which can be deadly, particularly in weak immune patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a zero patient relative who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, very large efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
The virus was initially very common in young children, elderly, and weak immune patients who suffer from respiratory diseases.
Images of coriza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study explained the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and the peak occurrence occurs in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, which is also called krup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been treated for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acute asthma exaserbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
These four HCoV communities have entirely adapted to humans and have generally had a small chance of mutating into a highly pathogenic disease, and nevertheless, extraordinary cases do occur for unknown reasons, as in the case of HCoV-NL63 subtypes that have recently been reported to cause heavy lower-breath infections in China.
Generally, when it gets the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend itself within humans, this virulence and pathogenicity of HCoV is also reduced.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases originated in the Middle East, cases of occasional secondary deployment to close contact have been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestation of MERS is similar to the clinical manifestation of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience acute kidney failure, which has so far occurred only in MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30% of patients exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
Until February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with high case deaths, which is 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most terrifying viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia patients retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the ongoing outbreak of lower breathway infection and caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Health Emergency as well as naming the disease COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases had been confirmed worldwide, with a rough case death rate of 3.4%.
Note, case deaths in Hubei, China, were 4.2%, while case deaths outside Hubei were 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with images of fever, cough, and asphyxiation.
Diarrhea was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly develop into acute breath disorder syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of nucleotide sequences, by 82%, both group into different branches of phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2's pathogenicity is clearly lower, but more infectious than that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 with no symptoms have been reported and may play a role in the rapid dispersal of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs shows very interesting equations and differences.
First, incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four other community HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show a more common picture in Community HCoV infections, which include mild or even nonspecific symptom images.
On the other hand, a small percentage of severe COVID-19 cases can look like SARS-CoV infections even with slightly lower ratios.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting pattern characteristics, similar to both the community's HCoV and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2's transmission capabilities are at least as high as the community's HCoV.
On the other hand, declining the notability of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions after some pathways in humans still need to be verified, as is the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Lastly, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the fuses sample.
"Whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral plays an important role, as in the case of the transmission of SARS-CoV, at least on certain situations, it must still be clarified by subsequent studies."
The also very important thing to know is whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as in the case of HCoV communities.
However, the image of SARS-CoV-2, which includes transmission capabilities, pathogenicity, and continuous dispersal in some pathways in humans, will have a profound effect on the ultimate fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
Four community HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have all adapted to humans.
Judging from another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and humans may have been species survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
The HCoV that causes severe disease in humans and humans suffering from heavy HCoV pain has been destroyed.
In order for this to happen, HCoV must replicate in humans in an adequate amount to enable the accumulation of adaptive mutations to counter host restriction factors.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak survives and the more people are infected, the more likely it is to be fully adapted to humans.
If the virus adapts well, its transmission in humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community CoVs circulated in the human population and triggered a cold in people who were immunocompetent.
This virus does not require animal reservoirs.
Instead, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans and its transmission in humans is untenable.
Both must defend themselves and perform breeding in zoonotic reservoirs as well as looking for opportunities to spread to vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or several intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar picture to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community HCoVs.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easily transmitted like HCoV community, at least today.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCoV communities and not aspathogenic as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It must still be observed whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt fully to humans and circulate in humans without a reservoir animal host or an intermediary.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural host, reservoir, intermediary, and tangerious HCoV.
Animals act as HCoV evolutionary hosts if they have closely related ancestry and share high homology at nucleotide sequence levels.
The ancestral virus usually adapts well and is nonpathogenic in this host.
Similarly, the reservoir host carries HCoV on a continuous and long course.
In the two cases, the host is naturally infected and is a natural host for HCoV or the parent virus.
Conversely, if the new HCoV enters the intermediate host just before or around the time the virus enters the human, the virus has not adapted to a new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of the amplification host by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily, then transmitting it to humans to amplifies the scale of human infection.
HCoV can have a dead-end infection if it cannot maintain its transmission in an intermediate host.
HCoV, on the other hand, can also adapt to intermediate hosts and even cause long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospectively that the case of zero SARS has a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies indicate that the animal seller has a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Moon fox (Paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the living animal market are the first to be identified as carrying an almost identical SARS-CoV-like virus with SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this was supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were reported since all weasels in the market were killed.
Nevertheless, it was reported that lunar weasels from the wild or farms not exposed to the living animal market largely gave negative test results for SARS-CoV, which hinted that lunar weasels may only act as hosts of intermediate amplification, but not natural resortvoir SARS-CoV.
Note, since 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it cannot be ruled out that perhaps many small mammal species also serve as hosts of SARS-CoV intermediate amplifiers.
All of these hosts appear to be late hosts of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal host for SARS-CoV went on to reveal a closely related CoV bat, called CoV bat Rhinolopus relative-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats gave positive test results for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequences.
This coV and other bat CoVs share an 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
This study became the foundation for the new concept that bats are hosts for the newly emerging human pathogen.
Some SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV) are also identified from bats, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
An angiotensin 2 modifier enzyme (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from bat fuses samples is shown using ACE2 bats, weasels, and humans as receptors for entry into cells.
Interestingly, the serum of SARS convalescent patients can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents ancestry closest to SARS-CoV in bats, with a nucleotide sequence homology of 95%.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent virus of SARS-CoV and bat is not a direct reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 bats and CoV-HKU5 bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, namely dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as a viral entrance.
The RNA polymerase dependent-RNA MERS-CoV sequence is phylogenetically closer to its match in the bat beta-CoV identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has yet been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relatives CoV-HKU25 bats share only 87% of nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not host the immediate reservoir MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arabian camels provide seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like camels of Middle East origin in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives identical to the virus found in humans isolated from the nasal weap of Arabian camels, which indicates further that camels are the actual host reservoir for MERS-CoV.
It is also important to note that massive viral decay with usually mildly observable symptoms on experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
Note, infected camels excrete the virus not only through respiratory routes, but also through fecal-oral routes, which is also the main route of viral decay from bats.
Nonetheless, the question remains to be answered because many of MERS' confirmed cases do not have a history of contact with camels before the awitting of symptoms, possibly the result of human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unidentified animal species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with CoV bat RatG13 isolated from bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are too large to establish a parent relationship.
In other words, bats may not host direct reservoir SARS-CoV-2, unless an almost identical bat CoV is found later on.
Possibly, SARS-CoV-2's intermediary animal hosts exist among wildlife species sold and killed in the Huanan Seafood Grocery Market, many early COVID-19 cases associated with this market, indicating the possibility of animal-to-human transmission.
Some recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggest that a group of small endangered mammals, known as the tronding (Manis javanica), may also carry ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
This new genom CoV tringil shares 85-92% homology of nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the CoV is closely related to the RatG13 with a similarity of 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
Both are grouped into two sublines of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in phylogenetic trees, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an amino acid sequence similarity of 97.4%.
The striking thing is that the RBD SARS-CoV-2 and the RatG13 are much different, even though the homology rate of sequences in the entire genome is higher.
Previous studies on the ailing trond also reported detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which turned out to also be related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted a different method of drafting and manual curation to produce partial genome sequences made up of about 86.3% of the complete viral genome.
We can't rule out the possibility of a grind as one of SARS-CoV-2's intermediate animal hosts.
However, there is currently no evidence supporting SARS-CoV-2 coming directly from the grind due to the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 grinders.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, tronds, and other mammals must still be established.
Although the highest homology of sequences on RBD was found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 stranding, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homology at the sequence level of the entire genome.
It is too speculated if it is said that the high level of resemblance between RBD beta-CoV relatives-SARS-CoV-2 stranding and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by convergent evolution whose selectivity is mediated.
The match hypothesis supports recombination between the relative beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 stranding and the RatG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary drive factor, recombination occurs heavily among beta-CoVs.
Researchers have still not been able to decide on the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may come from bat CoVs, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 parent viruses have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV named ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American three-color bats showed close kinship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat CoV, under the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, with Camelidae allegedly also its intermediate host.
To be more clear, current knowledge of HCoV's known animal origins is summarized in Picture 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the occurrence of HCoV interspecies transmission in history.
In about 1890, as HCoV-OC43 passed through species from livestock to infect humans, there was recorded a pandemic of respiratory infections.
The transmission history of HCoV-229E interspecies is not very clear.
Alfa-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between the two, there is an alpha-CoV alpaka.
Some evidence supports transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, who may have been in contact with bats in a joint ecological rally.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with the alpaca.
Second, alpha-CoV bats related to HCoV-229E exist variously and nonpathogenicly in bats, while alpha-CoV alpaka causes an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Lastly, alpha-CoV alpaka is not found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpaka getting alpha-CoV relatives-HCoV-229E of humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Tohru virus.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility is, while the alpha-CoV bat serves as the shell of the HCoV-229E gene, the alpaka and the Arabian camel may serve as an intermediate host transmitting the virus to humans, exactly as the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example for interspecies transmission from bats to Arabian camels and from Arabian camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known to early identification of the virus and is also reinforced with subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats constitute a rich viral species' barge for the exchange of interspecies genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, close-knit colonies, close social interactions, and strong flying skills, are all supportive conditions for bats to become ideal 'virus spreaders'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in Arabian camels for decades.
The virus has adapted to camels that have changed from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains relatively low mutation rates in this animal.
Its sporadic transmission to humans occurs by chance and humans remain the final host for MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmissions, the role of the tronding, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmissions is different.
Primarily, beta-CoV trrinching is highly pathogenic in the tronding.
The grind may be the final host to the SARS-CoV-2 kin beta-CoV-2, similar to the weasel in the SARS-CoV case.
In upcoming studies, some possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2 interspecies from animal to human must be taken into account or ruled out.
First, the bat could have been a reservoir host for the SARS-CoV-2 relative virus that was almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological rails with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, the trailer could have been one of the intermediary amplification hosts for the newly entered SARS-CoV-2 relative virus.
Humans get the virus through the slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is possible, many mammals, which include pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody surveys of pets and wild animals need to be conducted.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that connects both with bats and the trrinch.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Despite the various types of animal hosts, three major factors from the virus side are also important to ease CoV across species barriers.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stringed RNA viruses, estimates of the rate of CoV mutation can be considered "medium" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 per year per base, depending on the CoV adaptation phase to the new host.
CoVs have corrector exoribonucleases, deletions that result in very high mutability, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interesting thing, Remdesivir's nucleotide analogue is known to suppress CoV replication through this exoribunuclease inhibition and RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the rate of CoV mutation is about a million times higher than the rate of host mutation.
In addition, mutation rates are often high as CoVs have not adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV which has a high mutation rate, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, signaling higher rates of adaptation with humans.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other hosts closely related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV which has adapted to Arabian camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift will quickly make vaccines and antivirus agents against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genomes in CoV give extra flexibility in genome modification, for mutation and recombination, thus increasing the probability of interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by its many unique open read frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs often change templates randomly during RNA replication through unique "select-copy" mechanisms.
In hosts that serve as mixing containers, strand transition often occurs during CoV RNA transcription.
Complete RNA and highly homologous subgenomics can undergo recombination to form new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found on HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as have in CoV animals such as SL-CoV bats and CoV-HKU9 bats.
The interaction of the host-virus in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the interaction of viruses with host receptors is another major factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during the occurrence of interspecies transmission.
Based on computational analysis between human SARS-CoV isolate and weasel, SARS-CoV is thought to be experiencing rapid adaptation in various hosts, particularly with mutations in the S protein RBD.
Generally, RBD proteins S CoV interact with cell receptors and intensively target host antibody responses.
On SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its correceptor as the entrance to the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, weasels, mice, and raccoon dogs, thus allowing transmission of interspecies viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to differ between human virus isolates and weasels in RBDs and 4 of them located in receptor binding motifs for interaction with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV weasels have K479N and S487T mutations in their RBDs, which may increase the affinity of bulge protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be essential for adaptation of the virus to humans.
Note that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S units implies S protein binding affinity with human ACE2 is likely to have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed human ACE2 binding affinity and S SARS-CoV-2 protein 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-CoV proteins.
The also important thing to know is whether any other correceptors may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission..
Intriguingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with different sections on S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-terasetylation for HCoV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after interspecies transmission of its animal host.
In addition to cell receptors, the final results of HCoV interspecies transmission are also regulated by dependency factors and other host restrictions.
The difference in these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts, such as bats, Arabian camels, and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoV must take over host dependency factors and break into host restriction factors in order to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular determiners in this area of important viral interactions must still be identified and characterized.
Filtering the entire genome is unbiased to view dependency factors and SARS-CoV-2 host restrictions using the most advanced CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
The emergence of a new HCoV: back to the beginning of the plague
CoV diversity of bats gave great chances for the emergence of the new HCoV.
In this case, the bat CoV serves as the shell of the HCoV gene.
Additionally, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also move HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the gain or loss of a new protein encoder gene could potentially drastically modify the phenotype of the virus.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is thought to play an important role in adaptation to humans due to the relative-SARS-CoV bat virus isolated found to encode a variety of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a hallmark of removal of 29 nucleotides was found on strains isolated early in the human epidemic.
This deletion separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation supporting host transition.
Additionally, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV lineages, with a large number of smaller recombinant areas identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Recombination locations are also identified at nsp9, mostly nsp10, and partly nsp14.
Similarly, the occurrence of recombination between various lineages is shown to take place in the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurs in Arabian camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination occurrences have also been observed on other HCoVs where HCoVs experience recombination with other animal CoVs in its nonstructural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can play a role in accidental changes in the viral genome, most likely resulting from viral release from the pressures of selection experienced, such as by the host immune system.
An example of this effect is the complete loss of ORF4 on the HCoV-229E prototype strain as a result of the removal of two nucleotides.
While whole ORF4s can be observed in bat viruses and camels related to HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaka shows a single nucleotide insert that results in a skeletal shift.
Lastly, the evolution of the new HCoV was also moved by the pressure of selection in its reservoir host.
Symptoms are mild or without symptoms detected as bats are infected with CoV, which shows mutual adaptation between CoV and bat.
It seems that bats adapt well to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a defect in the activation of proinflammatory responses in bats would lower CoV-driven pathology efficiently.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the rise in regulation of the natural killer cell inhibitor NKG2/CD94 and the molecular expression rate of low class I main histocompatibility complexes.
In addition, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of high bat metabolic activity can suppress CoV replication and influence correcting by exoribonuclease thus giving selection pressure for the manufacture of highly pathogenic viral strains upon entering into new hosts.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also develop through recombination, which results in the procurement of new proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
CoV replicates strongly without triggering a strong host immune response.
Here lies the secret of carriers without symptoms and the cause of heavy cases in human infections.
Heavy symptoms are primarily due to the activation of excessive immune response as well as cytokine storms, with increased lung damage if the immune response is increased.
Conversely, in carriers without symptoms, the immune response is already detached from CoV replication.
The same strategy for severing immune response links may be beneficial in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon responses are especially strong in bats.
Therefore, the giving of type I interferons, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, inflammatory activation of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
For this reason, inflammatory inhibition of NLRP3 with MCC950 may be beneficial in COVID-19 handling.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general plot of the appearances of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-CoV bats that share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there is CoV bats that share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although weasels and other animals in the market were found to carry a virus identical to SARS-CoV, a direct intermediary host for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been found.
A very homologous Beta-CoV tringil with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which suggests that the tringling may play one of the intermediate hosts or beta-CoV tringil may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although still in question, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans either intentionally or by accident.
CoV was again the center of attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have greatly altered our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoir for HCoV on human transmission.
Very much evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from bats and transmitted to humans through an intermediate host.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection came from contact between humans and weasels in the wet market, it may have been the closure of the wet market and the killing of all weasels in it that ended the SARS epidemic effectively.
For the same reason, the tronding was supposed to be moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several beta-CoV stranding lineages closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, the truth and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted to humans by means of the trrinch and other mammals still have to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been in Arabian camels.
The camel serves as an important transport tool as well as as as a major source for meat, milk, leather, and wool products for the local community.
Arabian camels are widespread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, we cannot possibly kill all camels to control MERS, as it did in the wild animal market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS outbreak, a comprehensive approach must be made to develop vaccines for effective camels against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we can get rid of this virus, a new genotype can appear and cause an outbreak.
Various zoonotic CoVs circulate in the wild.
In particular, the potentially zoonotic CoV bats vary considerably.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience recombination, which results in the emergence of new CoVs that are easier to transmit and/or more deadly to humans in the future.
Culture eating wild animals in some places in China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the bitter experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better preparation and countermeasure plans must be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet long ago.
These viruses are in its natural reservoir until there is an opportunity for dispersal.
While bats have many features that support the spread of the virus, the chances of humans communicating with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated to avoid wild animals.
Sustainable surveillance of mammals needs to be done to better understand the ecology of the CoV and its natural host, which will prove beneficial in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is that humans must keep their distance from the ecological rails of the natural reservoir of zoonotic viruses.
Some sections of the puzzle origin of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin have not yet been found.
First, if the bat transmits the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the grinder, the conditions when the bat and the grinder share an ecological rail are important to know.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans contact bats must be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as an intermediary host in fact, the way the mammal interacts with other species, which include humans, bats, and tronds must be made clear.
Finally, due to many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, both experimental infections and surveillance must be carried out.
Whether a bat, a trrinch, or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus can be identified in its future natural host.
An ongoing investigation into this field will outline the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update on the diagnostic criteria of "presumed cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 needs to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guide to the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV).This guide is based on our experience and is a good reference to fighting pandemics around the world.
Nevertheless, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experiences; therefore, diagnostic and handling strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we answered one of the comments in our guide and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "presumed cases" and "confirmed cases" based on the Diagnosis and Handling Guide to COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is currently formally called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named coronavirus of heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To counter the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guide and the guide has been published online at Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
The guide has attracted much attention since it was published.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings as well as clinical practical experiences; therefore, the strategy of diagnosis and handling is also constantly being updated.
For example the Diagnosis and Handling Guide to COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, this commission has issued a total of seven editions with part of the context having been changed quite a lot.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring-giving proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guide as well as a valuable reference to this pandemic worldwide.
We support their significant work and express our gratitude.
Nevertheless, their work also requires updates based on the diagnosis and handling Guide for the latest COVID-19 (seventh version of trials) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case requires a combination of one of epidemiological history images with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or required fulfillment of three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel history or stay in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before symptoms awitan; (2) contact history with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid tests); (3) contact history with fevered patients or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before awitan symptoms; (4) contact history with clusters of confirmed cases (exposed 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring in small areas, such as homes, offices, school classes, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection imaging features; (3) total white blood cell count indicates normal lymphocyte count, decreases, or decreases in the early awitan stage.
Diagnosing a confirmed case must be based on a suspected case with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a sequence of entire viral genomes showing high homogeneity for a known new coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM antibody and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or changes in IgG antibody specific-SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or titer increased =4 fold in recovery phases above levels in acute phases.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acid in respiratory or blood tract samples was added to the second edition (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
Pathogenic detection of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then, serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the researchers' ongoing research into seeking optimal nucleic acid detection kits for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from breathways including blood taking, which increases the availability of various specimens, and supports inclusion of certain antibody positive results into confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us to be aware of patients with athic symptoms and no symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s flow chart should be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in future clinical practices and studies.
In closing, we hope more direct evidence will appear and ask the reader to comment.
For the diagnosis of "presumed cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend to follow and comply with the latest guide in their respective countries.
Our team will also update our guide periodically as a favor.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily death toll
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest death toll in a day from the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported the number of infected cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 cured cases living at home.
It recorded a total of 17 deaths.
In an online news brief, the director of the IEDCR, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Kuwaiti Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an announcement of the online video, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader said public transportation would be discontinued longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This cessation of public transportation has begun since March 26 and is planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of basic items -- medical, fuel, and food -- is still permitted.
The first recorded incident of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, in two people recently returned from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
By 19 March, the three men had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of corona virus infections of SARS-CoV-2 surpassed one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths are associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the corona virus.
The peak occurred on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first corona viral infection and Zambia suffered its first corona virus-related death.
North Korea claimed, on Thursday, that the country was one of the few countries to remain free from corona virus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States (U.S.), there are recorded over 244 thousand cases of corona virus, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Agency reports, citing Johns Hopkins University data, there are over 1,000 deaths in the US resulting from corona virus infections.
Worldwide, countries are announcing stricter actions to impede the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended quarantine of the region until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russian citizens would remain paid without the need to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend national emergency status for 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, ten votes abstained, and one vote refused.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy city of Mecca and Medina to all day; previously, the curfew only took effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended the stay order at home until May 1.
Stores in Australia lower purchase limits on toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoons, Australian store networks Woolworth and Coles respectively lowered toilet tissue purchase limits to two and one pack per transaction in all stores at a national level.
ALDI also implemented a one-pack limit, on Mondays.
These restrictions were announced as messages on the cashier and on his network's Facebook page.
Buyers reportedly stacked supplies due to COVID-19 fears in case the public had to do their own isolation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet paper for delivery to homes to one pack per order.
These changes followed the four-pack restrictions per transaction that Woolworths and Coles had previously applied respectively on March 4 and 5.
On his media statement of March 8, Coles reported that with the breaking down of the four-pack restrictions, "many stores are still running out in an hour since delivery", and called the request "never before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unprecedented".
Sales "increased sharply" last week, according to one of Woolworths' spokespersons.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packs last week.
To avoid scarcity, Coles ordered larger packs from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made supplies for special Wednesday promotional activities available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Peritel Association, said that the retail tried to increase supplies, but the limits of local government bodies for truck delivery times made it difficult.
He anticipated rising production costs, while suppliers attempted to meet demand, and fewer special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that since it had taken off supplies early, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the store supplies every night.
He stressed that toilet paper was a large volumed item so that the amount of supplies was low and, if sold out, made a lot of empty space on the shelves so that scarcity of goods was becoming increasingly tasteful.
Coles and Woolworths argue [that] if there is a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products such as toilet tissue and analysing can be [bought] and exist in large numbers, panic may be minimized, Russel Zimmerman said via the ABC News Agency.
Recycle toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday last that they ran out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made the Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, which made Sorbent, stressed they were working 24/7 to keep supply, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property vendors offered free toilet paper to the first bidder of auctions in Melbourne, as fewer auctions were held because buyers took pauses for Labor Day weekend long breaks.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, includes eight pages of inserts intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores are actually reluctant to apply the limits, according to the ABC Australia report on March 3, they say that they do not plan to implement purchase limits.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, analytics, dry food, hand washing soap, and flour.
Likewise outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon the British online supermarket Ocado was observed limiting the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak—a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to how wide the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO noted the need to encourage the government to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the state detects, tests, handles, isolates, and mobilizes its people in response, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
We are very concerned because of the dispersal and severity of both worry and because of the severity of alarming actions.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a CNN-published note in February, "besides influenza, no respiratory tract virus has ever tracked from its emergence to sustained global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never seen a pandemic triggered by coronavirus."
He continued, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status of the pandemic followed the WHO's January ruling that declared this outbreak an emergency of the world's troubling public.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said regarding this outbreak, "initially, this outbreak will worsen."
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is a 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) that is ongoing and caused by coronavirus heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a World-Defense Public Health Emergency on January 30, 2020, and declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territory, which resulted in around 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
Case fatality figures are estimated to be 4% in China, while worldwide range from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and asphyxiation.
Complications can include pneumonia and acute breathlessness syndrome.
Time from exposure to symptoms awitans in general is about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antivirus treatment.
The main treatments are symptomatic and supportive therapy. recommended preventive measures include hand washing, mouth-shutting while coughing, keeping a distance from others, and monitoring and self-inflicted isolation for people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by enforcing travel limits, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control, and facility closures.
This pandemic has led to heavy social disruption of the global economy, delays or cancellations of cultural, political, religious, sports activities, and the extent of scarcity of supplies of goods exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed both at national and local levels in 193 countries, which affect about 99.4 percent of the student population worldwide.
Misinformation regarding this virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, people with East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and people coming from areas with significant cases of the virus.
As a result of the reduction in travel and the closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (Hubei's provincial capital), reported cluster cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was conducted in early January 2020.
The cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Grocery Market and therefore the virus is thought to have zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak was called SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered and related virus with bat coronavirus, grinding coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms was later known to fall ill on December 1, 2019, and the person had no apparent connection to the later mentioned wet market cluster.
Among the initial case clusters reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have links to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post estimated that a case that can be traced to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, was probably the first. on February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, with new cases reportedly declining in China, but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had surpassed the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, particularly among people with milder symptoms.
Until February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young men, with people aged 19 and below forming 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK chief scientific advisor Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population needed to be infected before group immunity could be achieved.
The case refers to the number of people COVID-19 has tested and whose test results have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
Until March 23, no country had yet tested over 3% of its population, and many countries had made official policy not to test people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, up to January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that this undocumented infection was the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy is expected to be greater than reported cases.
The initial estimate of the basic reproductive figures (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was probably 5.7.
Most COVID-19 sufferers are cured.
For the uncured, time from symptom development to death is between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, up to 5 February, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over the age of 60 and 75% had pre-existing health disorders, which included cardiovascular disease and diabetes. official death counts from the COVID-19 pandemic in general referring to deceased persons who gave positive test results for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual fatality rate caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, given the official figure is likely not to include those who died without being tested, for example, at home, in a care home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the excess number of deaths during the pandemic surpassed the official COVID mortality calculation by a 4-5-fold factor.
A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) U.S. admitted, "We know [the number of deaths announced] is lower than the actual figure", a statement corroborated by a nonscientific report on overly low calculations in the U.S. An overly low calculation often appears in the pandemic, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
Until February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded respectively in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and territorial territories had reported deaths, on every continent, except Antarctica.
This number varies by region and over time, as well as is influenced by the number of testing, quality of health care systems, handling options, time since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, gender, and overall health. The ratio of death to cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the ratio of death to cases globally is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) as of 10 April 2020.
This figure varies by region.
In China, mortality ratio estimates decreased from 17.3% (for people with January 1-10, 2020 symptom awitan) to 0.7% (for people with symptom awitan after February 1, 2020). Other measures include case fatality (CFR) rates, which reflect the percentage of diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and infection fatality (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are not time bound and follow a particular population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimated the fatality rate of infection for the overall pandemic between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this range of estimates is in line with the results from the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical research that analyzes the impact of guerdon on CFR estimates.
The WHO asserted that this pandemic could be controlled.
The peak and end of the duration of this outbreak are unclear and may differ according to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Without even being controlled, infectious outbreaks are usually horizontal and then begin to decline as the disease runs out of hosts available.
However, it is almost impossible to make a plausible projection today about when it happened".
Senior Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "this outbreak may end June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice regarding the measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine stated that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, possibly for up to a year or two."
According to an Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical restrictions and other measures will be required "until vaccines are available (probably 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, as it is very easily transmitted, can disappear entirely" and the disease "may turn into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Virulence of repetition will depend on group immunity and mutation rates.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively unspecific and infected people can be without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory sputum (flegma), loss of smell power, asphyxiation, joint and muscle pain, throat pain, headaches, shivering, vomiting, hemoptisis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms including difficulty in breathing, chest pressure or settling chest pain, sudden confusion, walking difficulties, and bluish on the face and lips; medical attention is immediately suggested if these symptoms arise. further disease development can be severe pneumonia, acute breath syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, that is, without clinical symptoms, but with tests confirming infection, therefore, researchers recommend that those who are in close contact with an infected person should be closely monitored and examined to ensure that they are not infected.
The Chinese estimate asymtomatic ratios range from some to 44%.
The incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms awitan) typically ranges from 1 to 14 days, at most 5 days, for example uncertainty, the estimated number of COVID-19 sufferers who lose their initial smell 30%, then decrease to 15%.
Details about the way the disease spreads are still being studied.
The spread of COVID-19 is believed to occur primarily at close contact times and through small droplets produced when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is contact within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies found that uncovered coughs could cause droplets to be driven 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be transmitted by a small droplet that survives longer in the air and is produced when speaking.
Droplets can fall on a person's mouth or nose nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and lung cardiac resuscitation (RJP), can cause breathing secretions to turn into aerosols and then disperse through the air.
It can also occur when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose, and mouth.
Although there is concern that the virus can spread through the fuses, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government rejected the possibility of a fecal-orally SARS-CoV-2 transmission.Virus was most contagious in the first three days after symptom awitans, although dispersal may occur before symptoms are visible and at a further stage of the disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before symptoms awitancies, which signal transmission may occur prior to significant symptoms.
Few reports of asymatomatic cases have been laboratory-confirmed, but asymtomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact search.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) stated that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for up to three days on plastic (polipropilents) and rust-resistant steel 304, one day on cardboard, and over four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature. other pets and animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities suggest washing their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with surfaces that the infected person may have already touched.
The coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with cluster cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are associated with coronavirus in nature, and outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed if it is exposed to household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope.
The virus is thought to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B lineage) along with two bat derivative galurs.
The virus has 96% in common at the entire genome level with other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a difference of one amino acid in certain parts of the genome sequence between the grinding virus and the human virus.
To date, comparisons of the entire genome find there are at most 92% similarity of genetic material between the grinding coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, insufficient to prove that the grind is an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
Infection by the virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately carried out through the reaction of the counter transcription polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) on infected secretts or embedding CT imaging.
A study comparing between PCR and CT in Wuhan showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with the numerous imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as the first line test in diagnosing COVID-19."
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which were distributed first on January 17.
Testing uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, these tests are conducted on nasofaring wipers, but throat wipers can also be used. a number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these serological tests proved accurate enough to be widely approved of its use.
In the US, serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by certified laboratories.
Characteristics of radiographic imaging features and amputated tomography (CT) in people who are symptomatic include ground glass peripheral asymmetry opacity and no pleura effusion.
Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database for imaging findings on confirmed cases.
Because it overlaps with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and showed that although less specific to infection, imaging is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as a filter tool in the area of the epidemic.
An artificial intelligence-based neural convolution network has been developed to detect viral imaging features with radiography and CT.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include keeping a comprehensive personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and using a tissue when coughing or sneezing and throwing tissue into the trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical restriction measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. governments in different regions have restricted or urged to stop all nonexential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a scale spread stage of society in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in the community, and some members of the public do not know where or how they are infected.The health care provider who handles people who may be infected is advised to perform standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important step for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by the government for this purpose has sparked privacy issues, with the release of statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for this kind of surveillance restrictions.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and by April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of user distances to other mobile phones.
Subsequently, users will receive messages if they are adjacent to someone tested positive for COVID-19.Dating misunderstandings about how to prevent infection; for example, flushing the nose and gated with mouthwash is ineffective.
There is not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Handwashing is encouraged to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after from the toilet or when the hands look dirty; before eating; as well as after breaking through the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This encouragement is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by a household soap that damages its protective layer.
Furthermore, the CDC recommended the use of alcohol-based hand analytics with alcohol content at least 60% based on volume when soap and water were unavailable.
WHO encourages people not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of solutions (in a minute of disinfectant exposure for rust-resistant steel surfaces), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidin gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there are suspected or confirmed COVID cases in public facilities, such as offices or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote control, and ATM machines used by sufferers, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and noses with elbows bent or use tissues when coughing or sneezing and then immediately remove the tissues.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit volume and mileage of scattered expiratory droplets while speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on the timing and manner of masking.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Making masks can reduce the tendency of people to touch faces with not clean enough hands, which is the main source of transmission."Maker is also recommended for use by people who care for others who may suffer from this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for COVID-19 sufferers, although WHO also admits that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to encourage the use of masks to members of the public.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of nonmedical face masks made of fabric. China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks to healthy communities, especially when adjacent (1 metre (3 feet) or less) to others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or living in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned its society from going out to public without wearing masks or covering its nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear face masks while going public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government required any person entering the convenience store to wear a face mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear face masks while in public.
Taiwan, which produces ten million masks per day since mid-March, requires train passengers and intercity buses wear face masks per April 1.
Panama required the use of face masks each time outside the house, as well as recommending the manufacture of homemade face masks for those who could not purchase face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social restriction (also called physical restriction) is an act of infection control intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Social restrictions methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; as well as school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can apply social restriction methods by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping physical distance from others.
Today, many governments require or appeal to social restrictions in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced, starting from 250 (if not known for the spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50, and then to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned meetings in public areas involving more than two people. elderly and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and impaired immune systems that had a risk of serious illness and higher complications advised the CDC to stay at home only in areas experiencing outbreaks at the public level. in late March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to change the use of the term "social restrictions" to "physical restrictions", to make clear that the goal was to reduce physical contact by keeping social relations, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social restriction" gives the impression that people must isolate themselves entirely socially and not encourage people to keep in touch with others through alternative ways. some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during times of pandemic.
These recommendations include the encouragement to have sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-sustaining isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and people suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for self-imposed isolation that are correct, many governments require or recommend self-imposed quarantine for entire populations living in impacted areas.
The strictest self-imposed quarantine instructions were issued for people who included high-risk groups.
People who may be exposed to COVID-19 sufferers and people who have recently traveled to a country or region with extensive spread of COVID-19 are advised to quarantine themselves for 14 days since the time of possible last exposure.
Strategies in plague control are damming or supremacy, as well as mitigation.
The dam is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people as well as to perform other measures for infection control and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of disease throughout the population.
When it is no longer possible to stem the spread of the disease, subsequent efforts move on to mitigation stages: these measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care systems and the public.
A combination of damming and mitigation actions can be performed at the same time.
Supresion requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive numbers to less than 1. Part of the management of infectious disease outbreaks is attempting to lower the peak of the epidemic, known by incurring epidemic curves.
This lowers the risk of being overwhelmed on health care and gives more time for vaccine development and treatment.
Nonpharmacy interventions to deal with outbreaks include individual precautions, such as hand hygiene, wear face masks, and self-imposed quarantine; measures at the public level aimed at physical restrictions, such as closing schools and canceling mass meeting events; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in these kinds of interventions; as well as measures at the environmental level, such as surface cleaning. Other drastic measures aimed at stemming the outbreak were carried out in China as the severity of the outbreak was becoming more evident, such as quarantined throughout the city and imposed strict travel bans.
Other countries also implement a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced local mass filtering and quarantine, as well as issuing warnings about the movement of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for infected people performing self-imposed quarantines and imposes large fines for people who fail to do so.
Taiwan increased face mask production and punished medical supplies hoarders. sims for the UK and the United States showed that mitigation (slowing, but not stopping the spread of epidemics) and supremacy (reversing the growth of epidemics) had a major challenge.
Optimized mitigation policies can reduce the peak demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.
Supresion can be chosen, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is still circulating in the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first to be achieved), because otherwise, the transmission will surge back quickly as the succretion measures are dimmed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic brought about an impact on social and economics.
No specific antivirus drug has yet been approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are being made, which includes existing drug testing.
Taking free-sold flu drugs, drinking enough water, and rest can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can exacerbate the patient's condition.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also states that some "traditional and home medicines" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to COVID-19 patient needs is a basic step in responding to the outbreak.
ECDC and Europe's regional WHO offices have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services in order to divert resources at various levels, including focusing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if possible cancelling elective procedures, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, as well as improving intensive care skills by training personnel as well as increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known new coronavirus case can be traced to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Huanan Seafood Grocery Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus originated with one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has zoonotic origin. a pneumonia cluster with an unidentified cause was observed on December 26 and handled by doctor Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who notified CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital notified their colleague about the "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for the warnings she issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission subsequently issued an announcement to the public on December 31 and notified the WHO.
Quite a number of unidentified pneumonia cases were reported to health authorities in Wuhan who later triggered an investigation in early January, and in the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, supported by migration during Lunar New Year and because Wuhan was a major railway transport center and transit site.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one person in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data shows that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on January 20, 2020.Per March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. up to April 9, 2020, over 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; over 97,000 people died and over 364,000 were cured.
About 200 countries and territorial territories have at least one case.

A number of Chinese Communist Party (CPC) provincial-level administrators were dismissed regarding the handling of quarantine efforts in Central China, which was a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of political institutions in dealing with outbreaks in the region.
Some commentators believe that this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party secretary general Xi Jinping from public outrage related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected prior recognition of the coronavirus outbreak beginning in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The U.S. government of Donald Trump called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or a "Wuhan virus" and said that "the cover-up Chinese action gave power to the virus that is now turning into a global pandemic." This word was eventually criticized by a number of critics as racism and "displaced attention from the failure of its government in dealing with the corona virus."
The Daily Beast got a U.S. government message that outlined the communication strategy and clearly originated at the National Security Council, with the strategy cited as "All about China.
We were told to try and deliver this message in any possible way, including press conferences and appear on television."Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claimed that China's efforts to send aid to virus-affected countries were part of propaganda's urge to influence the world.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geo-political component, which includes fighting to gain influence through the reversal of facts and 'political generosity'."

On 22 March, after receiving a phone call from Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin dispatched Russian soldiers to send military medics, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy."
That source accuses Russia of carrying out "geopolistic and diplomatic" charm attacks.
President Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio ignored the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo aircraft containing medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to colleagues in the US, [Putin] assumes that if U.S. equipment and medical materials manufacturers get a chance, they will also be able to retaliate if necessary."
NATO's planned "Defender 2020" military exercises in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercises since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary General of the Nuclear Weapons Expedition Campaign Kate Hudson criticized the 2020 Defender exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this exercise not only endangers the lives of U.S. troops and many European countries participating, but also the residents of the country in which they operate."The Iranian government was severely impacted by this virus, with about two dozen MPs infected along with fifteen current or previous political figures.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and saying that his country is having trouble fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions on Iran.The outbreak has prompted a call to the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher funding rates for public health.
Political analysts suspect it could have a negative impact on Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to this pandemic.
South Korea criticized "ambiguous and passive Japanese quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that any people coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at a government-appointed location.
Initially, the South Korean community's views were divided regarding President Moon Jae-in's response to this crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions, both calling for Moon's impeachment, based on their claims of government error in dealing with the outbreak, as well as praising his response. The pandemic has allowed many countries to respond by issuing emergency laws.
Some commentators expressed concern that it could allow the government to strengthen its grip over power.
In Hungary, his parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by timeless decree, suspend parliament and elections, as well as punish the person deemed to spread false information about the virus and the handling of the crisis by the government.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed for cases of supply shortages, which stemmed from increased use of equipment globally to counter outbreaks, panic-induced purchases, and factory and logistical operating disruptions.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued warnings about drug shortages and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Some areas also have purchases due to panic that result in a void of basic needs, such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, which trigger supply shortages.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about the delay in shipping electronics.
According to WHO director general Tedros Adhanom, demand for self-protection devices increased 100fold.
This demand led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price as well as triggering delays in medical goods supply for four to six months.
It also causes a worldwide shortage of self-protective devices, and WHO warns that this will endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided new opportunities for daigou buyers to sell Australian products within China.
This activity resulted in scarcity of formula milk in some supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food products, the two areas were spared food shortages.
Chinese and Italian measures in countering the illegal hoarding and illegal trade of important products were successful so that an anticipated acute food shortage would occur in Europe and North America could be averted.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not experienced a mean decline, but prices can rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, as Chinese government officials removed pork reserves to ensure the nutritional richness of the community.
Similar laws also exist in Italy, which requires food producers to store reserves for emergencies such as these.
The global economic decline has been felt in China: according to media reports on March 16, the economy in China was devastated in the first two months of 2020 as a result of measures the government took to withstand the spread of the virus, and retail sales plunged by 20.5%.
Since mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the virus outbreak is thought to cause a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimated that the market would remain turbulent until there was a clearer picture of the potential final outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the impact of epidemic-induced economic fallout on global growth could surpass the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimation from experts at Washington University in St. Louis stated the outbreak impacted over $300 billion on the world supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) was reportedly "a mess" after petroleum prices suffered a sharp decline as a result of reduced demand from China.

On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock indexes, which included the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded the sharpest drop since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007–2008.
The three stock indexes closed the week with a drop of over 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH asserted the credit ratings of the Chinese government, but retained Outlook Negative.
Stock plunged again due to concerns about the coronavirus, the largest drop occurred on March 16.
A lot of people think an economic recession might happen.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the central bank and state's emergency measures on time.
The central bank reacted faster than they did during the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the most severely impacted sectors due to travel bans, public places closures including tourist spots, and government actions restricting travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to at least demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the shipping line industry is at a rate that has never been seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincides with Chunyun, the main travel season related to the Lunar New Year holiday.
A number of events involving many people were cancelled by the central government and the area, including the annual Lunar New Year festival, and private companies also independently closed shops and tourist spots, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist sites are closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of 31 provinces, Chinese cities, and territories, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to be reopened until that date.
These regions are the producers of 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased the countermeasures of infectious diseases to the highest level and announced a state of emergency, closing the school to March, and canceling the New Year celebrations. the retail sector was globally impacted due to reduced working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America dropped by 40%.
The North American and Middle Eastern retailers suffered a 50–60% drop.
This also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
Worldwide shopping mall operators enact additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check purchasers' temperatures, and cancellation of events, according to the UN Economic Commission's estimate for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could cause people in extreme poverty in Latin America to grow between 14 and 22 million people compared to the situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of China's 300 million rural migrant workers were abandoned at home in the inland province or trapped in Hubei province, and in March 2020, over 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates, the coronavirus outbreak could lead to the loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. region quarantine in India caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who were paid through daily wages) to be unemployed. surveys from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of households in Canada suffered some sort of job loss. Nearly 900,000 workers lost jobs in Spain since the enactment of the quarantine of the region in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, as many as 4 million French workers filed temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers filed a universal credit scheme. nearly half a million companies in Germany filed a short-term work scheme subsidized by the government for its employees, called Kurzarbeit.
Germany's short-term work compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Worldwide, the performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were impacted enormously by the pandemic, which influenced the operation of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and self-sufficient.
Art and cultural sector organizations seek to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to give people access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of employees and communities, and support artists if possible.
In March 2020, worldwide and at different levels, museums, libraries, show places, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely, with its exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were deployed to provide alternative services via digital platforms, and other adverse effects of the latest and very fast-growing disease were the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, as well as fashion shows.
The film industry was also disrupted, and the Vatican announced that the celebration of the Holy Week in Rome, which fell in the last week of the Prapaskah Christian repentance season, was cancelled.
Many dioceses encourage the Christian elderly to stay at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services via radio, live online or television broadcasts, while others offer drive-in or lantature worship.
With the church and chapel closed by the Roman Catholic Diocese as well as the vacated St. Peter's Square of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and limited public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the area affected by the outbreak and places of worship were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to sanctuaries in Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the worldwide sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak screwed up the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled until after 2020, but will not be more than summer 2021."Worldwide, casinos and other game places were closed and live broadcasts of poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This led to many gamblers moving to online gambling, many online gambling sites reporting significant new increases in enrollment. the entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups delaying or canceling concert tours.
Many major theatres such as Broadway also delayed all performances.
Artists explore various ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as online live broadcast concerts or making web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, disseminate, and publicize their work.
Many coronavirus - themed Internet memes are spread online with a lot of people switching to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against Chinese and East Asians, as well as against people from affected regions of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
The incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility are observable in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of cases were still limited in China) noted the racist sentiment expressed in various groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or received what they claimed to be a fitting reward.
Some countries in Africa also experience increased anti-Tingkok sentiments.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their area's origin.
There is already support for the Chinese, both online and offline, and for people in the area affected by the virus.
Following the development of the outbreak into new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience serious outbreaks of COVID-19, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea at first signed a petition to ban Chinese from entering their country in an attempt to stop disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan became a trend on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States reported increasing levels of racist abuse and assault.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus", a term which critics considered racist and anti-Tiongkok.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, who border China, and study in major Indian cities are reported to be subjected to coronavirus outbreak-related abuse.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party of state units in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh stated that China has destroyed nature and "that is why God is taking revenge on them."
The statement was later denounced by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata, by calling it "a mess".In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Tionghoa residents flared up due to the pandemic, with foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and targeted for "dispossession".
Many newspapers that use paid dissemination have removed it for part or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists choose to quickly distribute the results on preprinted servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of viruses and that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The existence of the virus in the sample is confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This testing is specific and is designed to detect the virus RNA SARS-CoV-2 solely.
This testing is used to confirm new or still active infections.
Detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for diagnosis and surveillance of populations.
Antibody tests show the number of people already infected, including people whose symptoms are too mild to report or who have no symptoms.
The accurate mortality of the disease and the rate of group immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country has yet had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
Until March 23, no country had yet tested over 3% of its population, and there was a large variation in the number of testing that countries had conducted.
This variability may also significantly influence the reported fatality figures of cases, which are most likely calculated to be too high in some countries.
Using real-time back transcriptional polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR), these tests can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasofaring wipers or sputum samples.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test performed on the throat wiper was only reliable in the first week of the disease.
In time, the virus could disappear in the throat while it continues to replicate in the lungs.
Alternatively, for infected people tested in the second week, sample material can be taken from deep breath ducts by using a suction catheter or material released through cough (sputum) can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using real-time transcription polymerase chain reactions (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed testing on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed the PCR-CoV-2-based SARS detection tool (PowerChek Coronavirus) which was clycised on 28 January 2020.
This device seeks the "E" gene owned by all coronavirus betas, and the specific RdRp gene for SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for PCR-CoV-2-based SARS detection devices. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed the New RT-PCR Real-Time Koronavirus Diagnostic Panel 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories via International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests at the old version of the test tool gave unconvincing results due to reagent errors, and the number of testing at CDC in Atlanta was limited; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was considered unreliable until February 28, 2020, and it was not until then that state laboratories and local laboratories were allowed to perform testing.
This test was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration based on Emergency Use Authorization.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19-based RT-PCR testing on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available nationwide on March 9, 2020.
No quantity limits were announced; collection and processing of specimens should be carried out in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests were developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care, and on March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued the same authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received the EUA from the FDA for testing which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved testing that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology that is not PCR.
Since it does not require a series of temperature-turning cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott anticipates increasing production to produce 50,000 tests per day. tests that use monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind new nucleocapsid (protein N) coronaviruses are being developed in Taiwan, in hopes of providing results within 15 to 20 minutes such as rapid influenza tests.
A library review published in March 2020 concluded that "the thorax photograph has a small diagnostic value in its early stages, as the CT [computed tomography] may have existed before the symptom awitans."
Typical features on CT include bilateral ground-glass multilobar opacity with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and posterior.
Subpleura domination, crazy paving, and consolidation are formed as the disease progresses.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the origin point of the current pandemic showed that CT was significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many imaging features overlapping with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT should not be used for filtering or as the first line test in diagnosing COVID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial filtering.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect infections in individuals since about 7 days after symptom awitancies, to determine immunity to diseases, and in population surveillance. an examination can be made in a central laboratory (CLT) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
An automated system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these checks, but its availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT, it is commonly used one peripheral blood specimen, although a series of specimens can be used to follow an immune response.
For PoCT, it is commonly used one peripheral blood specimen obtained through a skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR method, an extraction step is not required before inspection. on March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provide notification to the agency as necessary and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test had been approved by the FDA based on emergency use authorization. in late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test tools that could detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The testing capacity is up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so it's much faster than conventional PCR tests on viral RNA.
Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after the awitting of the infection in early April, the United Kingdom found that none of the antibody tests it purchased were good enough for use.
Hong Kong devised a scheme in order for patients expected to stay home, "the emergency department will give specimen tubes to patients," they spat into them, sent them back, and obtained test results moments later. The British NHS announced that the NHS was pioneering a suspected case testing scheme at home so as to eliminate the risk of patients infecting others if they come to the hospital or had to disinfect ambulances if used. On lantature testing for suspected cases of COVID-19, a professional health worker would take samples using appropriate precautions.
Lantature testing centers have helped South Korea perform the fastest and widest testing compared to any country. on March 2, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Germany said that Germany had a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in the road care order and 10,700 testing had been conducted in the previous week.
Costs are borne by health insurance if tests are requested by doctors.
According to president Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, landature tests were offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the number of tests conducted in Germany is unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including weeks 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and only further testing if combined samples were found positive. In Wuhan, an emergency detection lab of 2,000 square meters named "Huo-Yan" (Mongama: "Fire Eye" in Indonesian) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, which could process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With its construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling showed that cases in Hubei could be 47% higher and associated costs for quarantine handling could double if this testing capacity did not exist.
Wuhan Laboratory was soon followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, its total daily capacity of 50,000 tests per day. an open source multiplex design released by Origami Assays can test as many as 1,222 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 examinations. this balanced design can be run in a small laboratory without the need for robotic fluid handlers.
By March, insufficient shortages and numbers of reagents had been a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
Because of that, a number of researchers attempted to explore sample setup protocols involving sample warming at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. on 31 March, the United Arab Emirates reportedly conducted more coronavirus testing per capita population than any country, and was ready to increase the testing scale to reach most of the population.
This was achieved through a combination of lantature testing and the purchase of population-scale mass yield laboratories from Group 42 and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory was able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and was the first laboratory to have this scale outside China.
Various testing recipes targeting various parts of coronavirus genetic profiles were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted German recipes for the production of test tools sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop on their own.
German recipes were published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control were not available until January 28, thus slowing down testing available in the U.S. Early in the outbreak, China and the United States were troubled with the reliability of test tools; these two countries and Australia could not provide enough test tools to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts testing.
In contrast, experts say that the wide availability of testing in South Korea helps reduce the spread of new coronaviruses.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector laboratories, was built within a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the increase in the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the wide spread of the virus led to hundreds of thousands of testing waiting for work in U.S. private laboratories, and supplies of steam tools as well as chemical reagents becoming critical.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy issues on their test tools.
In the United States, test tools developed by the CDC had "a flaw"; the government later removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing by privates. Spain purchased test tools from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may be the result of failures in collecting samples or using test tools correctly.
The Spanish ministry said that they would pull equipment that gave the result incorrectly, and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of test tools purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test tools from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that these test tools be dumped into the Danube river, and Ateş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said the test tools Turkey purchased from China had "high fault rates" and they did not "use them". United Kingdom purchased 3.5 million test tools from China, but in early April 2020, they announced that these test tools could not be used.
Testing, which is followed by quarantine of tested positive people and tracking people who are in contact with positive people SARS-CoV-2, gives positive final results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V –, the site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of 3,400 people, at a distance of about 10 days.
About half of those tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases found were quarantined.
With restrictions on travel to this community, new infections are eliminated altogether.
With aggressive contact tracking, restrictions on entry, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is growing much slower than other developed countries despite extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail companies.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore advised residents to stay home on 28 March, but the schools reopened in time after the holiday on 23 March.
Some other countries also handle pandemics with aggressive contact tracking, restrictions on entry travel, testing, and quarantine, but with quarantines of not-so-aggressive regions, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a much lower fatality rate of cases, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect people who have mild symptoms or without symptoms.
The WHO recommended that countries that did not have testing capacity, and national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience, send the first five COVID-19 positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 exist in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "% Positive results of testing" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people who are hospitalized will have % of higher positive results than a country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors.
Washing the hands, also referred to by hygiene of the hands, is the act of cleaning one's hands aimed at removing dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap consistently at certain "critical moments" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, e.g. diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted via fecal-oral routes.
People may also contract respiratory diseases, such as influenza or cold, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eye, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucosal membrane).
Five critical moments throughout the day that are essential for washing your hands with soap are: before and after defecating, after cleaning the child’s buttocks or changing a diaper, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or processing meat, fish, or raw poultry.
The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for the sick.
After changing diapers or cleaning a kid who just used the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal excrement.
Medical hand sanitization refers to the practice of hygiene relating to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medication or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to clear hands from pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause diseases) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
It is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, corona virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infection;
as well as reducing infant mortality rates in home labor.
Studies conducted in 2013 showed that increased hand washing practices can slightly increase the high growth of toddlers.
In developing countries, child mortality from respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate due to the disease by nearly 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing may reduce cases of diarrhea by about a third; these interventions can be made by providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be attributed to hand washing with soap. washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory tract infections (ISPA), as subconscious behavior is performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the number one cause of infant child death; it causes the death of about 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children annually.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before eating and after using toilets becomes an embedded habit can save more lives instead of any vaccine or medical action, as well as reducing deaths from diarrhea by nearly half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by up to a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined along with other sanitation measures as part of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Handwashing also protects itself from impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage caused by skin drying.
Studies conducted in 2012 in Denmark found that excessive hand washing could lead to itchy and scaly skin conditions, known as hand excise or hand dermatitis, which are especially numerous among health officials.
Handwashing is too often also seen as one symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments throughout the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of the disease: before and after using the toilet (to pee, to defecate), after cleaning the child's butt (to change diapers), before feeding the child, before feeding and before/after preparing food or processing meat, fish, or raw poultry.
Another important time to apply the right handwashing technique to prevent infection is before and after treating wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing noses; after touching animal dung or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has a highest rate of 97 percent; the United States is almost in the middle with 77 percent; and China at its lowest rate with 23 percent. Now there are several behavioral change methodologies available to improve the adoption of soap washing habits at critical times. Washing hands groups for learners at a specified time is one of the choices in developing countries to familiarize hand washing in child behavior.
The Basic Health Care Program the Department of Education implements in the Philippines is an example of proper-scale actions to support health and child education.
The giving of worm medicine twice a year, coupled with washing your hands daily with soap and brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
The program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The cleaning of microorganisms from the skin is reinforced by the addition of soap or detergent to the water.
The main work of soap and detergent is reducing barriers to solution and increasing soluble power.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleaner because fat and protein, which are organic dung components, do not dissolve easily in water.
Nevertheless, the cleaning of fats and proteins is aided by sufficient water flow.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may be able to contain bacteria obtained from previous use.
A small number of studies researching the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer was unlikely due to the bacteria being flushed with foam.
Nevertheless, the CDC still states "the liquid soap it spends from the container untouched is preferred."
Soap antibakeri is largely encouraged to a health-conscious society.
To date, there has been no evidence that the use of antiseptic or disinfectant recommended is better for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antebakery agents such as triklosan, which have a wide list of resistant organism strains.
So even if antibiotic - resistant strains are not targeted by antibacterial soap, they may not be as effective as marketed.
In addition to surfactin and skin protective substances, advanced formulations can contain acids ( acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH controller, benzoic acid as an active antimicrobial, and further skin conditioners (Catoric tongue, vitamins, menthols, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health shows that regular soaps are as effective as consumer-level antibacterial soaps containing trichlosan in preventing diseases and cleaning bacteria from the hands.
Warm water that is comfortable to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Warm water is more effective compared to cold, well - watered water in removing natural oils that withstand dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to the beliefs of many, however, scientific studies suggest that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in hand.
Hand-assimilation or hand antiseptics is a cleanness agent that is not water-based.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand hygiene agents of water-based alcohol scrubbers (also called alcohol-based hand scrubbers, antiseptic hand scrubbers, or hand sharpeners) became known.
Most of these hygiene agents are based on isopropyls of alcohol or ethanol that are formulated along with thickening materials such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) into gels or along with humectants such as glycerin into liquids or foam in order to be easy to use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding hydrogen peroxide encer increases antimicrobial activity further. hand analysis containing at least 60-95% of alcohol is an efficient germ killer.
Rub alcohol analytics kill bacteria, bacteria that are resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (concluding HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and mushrooms.
Alcohol analysis containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (log reduction 3.5, similar to 35 decibel reductions) of bacteria in hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (log reduction 4 to 5) of bacteria in hand 1 minute after use. Hand analysis is most effective against bacteria and is less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand analysis is almost entirely ineffective against norovirus-type viruses (or Norwalks), the most common cause for infectious gastroenteritis. hand antiseptics or alcohol scrubbers in adequate amounts should be used to thoroughly wet or cover two hands.
The front and back of the two hands as well as on the sidelines and the tips of all fingers are rubbed about 30 seconds to liquid, foam, or dry gel.
Fingertips should also be washed well by rubbing them in two palms, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest hand washing instead of hand polishing, especially when the hands look dirty.
Increasing use of an analytical agent due to the ease of use and rapid killing activity against microorganisms; however, an analytical agent should not have been used in place of correct hand washing, unless soap and water were unavailable.
Alcohol-based hand-animating uses can often cause dry skin, unless emolients and/or skin moisturizer are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding glycerin and/or other emolients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand analysis containing emolients caused irritation and skin droughts much lower than soap and antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive substances in alcohol hand polishing is rare.
A lower tendency causes disturbing contact dermatitis to be the attraction of this product compared to hand washing with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents do not clean hands of organic materials, but only disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens because pathogens are still on hand.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand analytics depends heavily on its materials and formulations, and according to history, the product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol scrubbers.
Recently, the formulation using benzalconium chloride proved to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activity after wear, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy proved to be reduced after repeated use, perhaps due to progressive side effects reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or land instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but it is less effective than soap.
One concern is, if contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ash may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because, if contact with water, ash will form an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash and sand as soap alternatives when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique based on the recommendations of the U.S. Centers for the prevention of disease transmission includes the following measures:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because a silenced basin may be contaminated, while water temperatures seem to have no effect.
Rub hands by rubbing them with a lot of soap, including the back of the hand, between the fingers, and under the fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more accurately when using soap than when using water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubs longer removes more germs.
A thorough flush under the water flows.
Washing in the basin can make the hands contaminated again.
Dry it with dry rags or let it dry in the air.
Wet, moist hands are more easily contaminated, and often missed areas are thumbs, wrists, areas between the fingers, and under the fingernails.
Artificial nails and flabbergasted nail polish can store microorganisms.
The moisturized lotion is often recommended to keep the hand from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing when tap water and/or soap is not available, for example, draining water from hangers or bottles and being holed and/or using ash, if necessary, in developing countries. In situations where water supply is restricted (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there is a water-saving solution, such as "tippy-tap", as well as other low-cost options.
Tippy Keran is a simple technology that uses a bottle of water hung from a rope, a lever operated by the foot to pour a little water into the hand, and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part in the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the shape of hand drying most effectively in public toilets.
More and more studies show that paper rags are much cleaner than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper lap industry, to compare paper lap hygiene levels, warm air hand dryers, and more modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with warm air dryers, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average 194% in knuckles and 254% in palm.
Drying with jet air dryers led to a total increase in the number of bacteria averaging 42% in the knuckles and 15% in the palm.
After washing and drying hands with paper rags, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76% in knuckles and 77% in the palm. The scientist also did tests to determine the potential for cross contamination in other toilet users and toilet environments as a result of every kind of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which breathed air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microorganisms from hands and units and potentially contaminate other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters away.
The use of warm air hand dryers spread microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from dryers.
Paper laps showed no significant spread of microorganisms. in 2005, in studies conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, changes in the following numbers of bacteria are observed:
There is much manufacturing of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying by using paper rags.
Hand washing is an alternative during travel if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand analytics must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was required much after Hungarian physicist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered his effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in hospital environments.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital employees to wash their hands in case they forget.
One study found that infection rates declined with the use of the device.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap and water or gel to wash and rub each part of the hand.
The hands must be rubbed against each other with intertwined fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, a furbrush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can survive in the water at hand, hands need to be washed thoroughly and dried clean.
After drying, paper rags are used to turn off the water tap (and open the exit if necessary).
This action avoided hand-recontamination from that surface.
The purpose of washing hands in the health care order is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("courage") and avoid its transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of washing hands is still at an unacceptable rate in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that washing the right hands and other simple procedures could lower the rate of catheter-related blood flow infections by 66 percent.
A guide to the WHO's concept of hand hygiene can also be seen on its website for public commentary.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstrations of compliance to regulations are required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Seconds" to wash hands:
after exposure to blood/body fluid
before aseptic duty, and
After the treatment of patients, adding antiseptic chemicals to soaps (the "drugs" or "antimicrobials") serves to kill hand washing materials.
The kill function may be desired before performing surgery or in situations when antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To 'rub' the hand before surgical surgery requires taps that can be turned on and off without touching, chlorhexidin or iodine washers, sterile wipes to dry the hands after washing, and sterile brushes to rub as well as other sterile instruments to clean under the nails.
All the jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and lower arms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long drop time (10 minutes) is not required.
When flushing, the water in the lower arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
Upon finishing hand washing, the hands were dried with sterile cloth and surgical robes were worn.
To reduce germ spread, it is better to wash your hands or to use hand sharpening before and after handling the sick.
For control of staffilokocus infections in hospitals, it was found that the largest benefits of hand-cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and that additional benefits were obtained very little as the frequency of hand cleaning was increased above 35%.
Washing with regular soap results in more than triple transmission of infection disease to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. comparison between rubbing hands with alcohol-based solution and washing hands with antibacterial soap with a median time of 30 seconds each indicates that alcohol-based hand scrubbery reduces bacterial contamination 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand scrubbing to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and the Clostridium difficile spores from the hand. interventions to improve hand hygiene in the health care order can involve education for staff about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand scrubbering, and written reminders as well as verbal to staff.
More research is needed to know the most effective interventions in the various health care order.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective fundamental way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in residents' homes, schools, and workplaces makes the target of achieving universal handwashing behavior a challenge.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing taps near private toilets or public toilets are rare, although options are available for making cheap hand washing.
In any case, low levels of hand washing may also occur because of embedded habits and not because of a lack of soap or water.
The encouragement and encouragement of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing, and produce long-term population behavioral changes.
In order to run effectively, supervision and evaluation are required.
Systematic review of 70 studies found that a community-based approach was effective in improving handwashing at LMIC, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. one example of hand washing dilation at the school was "Three Stars approach" by UNICEF which encouraged schools to take simple and cheap measures to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
As the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one star to finally three stars.
Building a hand sanctum can be part of a handwashing campaign that is carried out in order to reduce child disease and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that is trying to achieve the goal of behavioral change as a result of the 2019-2020 corona virus pandemic, UNICEF encourages the use of hand washing emoji.
Some studies examine the effectiveness of overall hand washing costs in developing countries in relation to avoidance of Disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the size of years lost to illness.
One review showed that encouraging hand washing with soap was significantly more cost-effective instead of water intervention and other sanitation.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as newly given birth to mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognised in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing" in England.
At the time, many still believed that infection was caused by a stench called miasma or bad air.
In the 1980s, outbreaks transmitted through food and health care-related infections made the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more active encouraging hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from the infectious disease.
For example, "correct hand washing techniques" posters were hung next to a handwashing sink in public toilets as well as in toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "wash the hands of" something means expressing one's reluctance to take responsibility for something or engage in something.
The expression comes from the Bible chapter of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used expression in the British community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins washing her hands continuously to clear imaginary stains; actions that show her guilt for the crimes she committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after remembering or contemplating unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often and tend to value hand washing equipment more.
Furthermore, the person left to wash his hands after the meditation has a smaller possibility of engaging in "cleaning" compensation measures, such as volunteering.
Religion orders hand washing for the purposes of hygiene and symbolic. symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a ritual part of hand washing in many religions, including Bahá'í Trust, Hindus, tevilahs and netillats of yadayim in Jews, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Jews, and Islam required hand washing after using toilets.
In addition, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhs, Jews, and Islam required hand washing before and after eating.
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of safety methodology and job health for hazard control for prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control of hazards at work depends on the location of work and job tasks, which are based on the assessment of risk of exposure sources, the severity of disease in the community, and the risk factors of each worker who may be prone to contract COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Work Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk jobs have minimal employment contact with the public and other co-workers; for this work, it is encouraged basic infection prevention measures, which include hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if ill, respiratory ethics, and conduct cleaning as well as routine disinfection of the work environment.
Works at risk of moderate exposure include jobs requiring close or frequent contact with persons unknown or suspected of suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected due to transmission in an ongoing society or international travel.
The group includes workers who have contacts with the general public such as in schools, working environments with high population density, and high volume retail order.
Danger control for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, includes ventilation using high efficiency air filter, protection against sneezing, and providing self-protective devices when encountering COVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers health workers and morgues exposed to persons known or suspected to suffer from COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases into very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or retrieve or handle specimens from, persons known or suspected to suffer from COVID-19.
The appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering control, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and self-protective tools appropriate to work duties.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have some impact in the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to care for others, or for fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns can change, both in terms of the type of goods requested and how to acquire these items (such as shopping outside the rush hour, through delivery, or lantature).
Finally, shipments of goods from highly impacted geographic areas of COVID-19 can be disrupted. preparedness and infection disease countermeasure plans can be used to guide protective measures.
Plans consider the level of risk associated with various workplaces and employment tasks, include sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community order, as well as risk factors of each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
Plans also outline the necessary controls to address such risks and emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
The preparedness and plan of treatment of infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The objectives of outbreak countermeasures include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people who are at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in the supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where businesses are influencing countermeasures being taken.
A danger control hierarchy is a framework widely used in safety and work health to group danger control based on its effectiveness.
When the danger of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative dialing, and lastly self-protective tools.
Technical control includes isolating employees from job-related hazards without depending on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in policy or work procedures that requires worker or jobgiver action.
Self-protective tools (APDs) are considered to be less effective than engineering and administrative control, but can help prevent some exposure.
All APD types must be selected based on hazards in workers, properly installed as they apply (e.g., respirators), worn consistently and correctly, checked, treated, and replaced periodically, if necessary, and released, cleaned, and properly stored or disposed to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Work Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk jobs have minimal employment contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if ill, respiratory ethics include covering cough and sneeze, providing tissue and garbage containers, preparing work remotely or working shifts with a gradual arrival/return time, if necessary, telling workers not to use other people's tools and equipment, and routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Quick identification and isolation of potentially transmitted individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms should stay home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-decreasing medication or other symptom-altering medications, and so that the policy of sick leave is flexible so as to allow employees to stay home to care for sick family members, and for employees to know this policy.
According to OSHA, moderate exposure-risk work includes employment requiring close contact or frequent within six feet (1.8 meters) with persons unknown or suspected of suffering from COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to transmission in the community around a business location, or because someone has just travelled internationally to a location with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
These groups include workers who have contacts with the general public such as at school, a working environment with high population density, and high volume retail order. Engineering control for this group and high risk groups includes installing high efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation levels, installing clear plastic barriers such as sneezing guards, and installing drive-thru windows or landscapes for customer services. Administrative control for this group and high risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face encounters with virtual communication, making a shift of work with arrival/return time, stopping nonessential travel to locations that are experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, developing emergency communication plans include forums to answer workers' concerns, equiping workers with education and training about COVID-19 risk factors and protective behavior, training workers who need to use clothes and work environments that support personal higiene and require regular hand washing, limiting customer and public access to workplaces about hand washing and other measures of protection measures, need to use the display or self-to use the display of the shield, at least the display of the shield or the device.
Workers in this risk group rarely need a respirator.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper control to protect workers and other passengers includes separating a sick person from another person by a distance of 6 feet, appointing one cabin crew to take care of a sick person, and offering a face mask for a sick person or asking him to shut his mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crews must wear once-weary medical gloves when treating sick passengers or touching potentially contaminated bodily fluids or surfaces and perhaps other self-protective devices if sick passengers have fever, constant cough, or difficulty breathing.
If you are ill, or travelling, or on a ship, or on a boat, or on a boat, or on a boat, or you are on a boat, or you are on a boat, or you are on a boat, or you are on a ship, or you are on a journey.
Ideally, medical follow-up was carried out in the cabin of an isolated person, regardless of the spread in the community, for schools and daycare facilities, the CDC recommended short-term closures to clean up or disinfect if an infected person was ever in the school building.
If there is a transmission in the community at a minimum to moderate rate, social restriction strategies can be applied, which include: cancelling field visits, meetings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education, choir classes, or eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between desks, gradual arrival times and return times, restricting nonesential visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
If there is a high transmission in local communities, in addition to social restriction strategies, extending the closure of schools can be considered for law enforcement officers who engage in daily routine activities, the risk of immediate health is considered to be low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must make contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 persons are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including using appropriate self-protection tools.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect the belt and task gear before being reused using spray or a household cleaning lap and follow standard operating procedures to control and dispose of secondhand APD as well as to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers certain health workers and morgues to be at high or very high risk categories of exposure.
Work at risk of high exposure includes giving health care, support, laboratories, and medical transportation personnel exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
This work becomes at risk of exposure very high if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or take or handle specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, multiple procedures and dental examinations, or the taking of invasive specimens.
High exposure-risk mortuary work includes workers involved in preparing bodies of persons known or suspected of COVID-19 cases at the time of death; this work becomes at very high risk of exposure if workers perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for this risk group include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol-producing procedures are performed.
Special negative pressure vents may fit in some health care order and morgues.
Specimens must be dealt with by Biological Safety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come be separated into different waiting rooms based on if they are suspected of COVID-19 cases. in addition to other APDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working within 6 feet of known or suspected patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and people performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95's approved filter face cover respirators or better should be used in the context of written and comprehensive respiratory protection programs that include suitability tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend covered shirts entirely or coveralls because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted through bodily fluids.
The WHO only recommended surgical masks for screening officers at the entry point.
For people taking respiratory specimens, treating, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or face shields, robes, and gloves.
If an aerosol-producing procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that APD supply is insufficient worldwide, WHO recommends minimizing APD needs through long-range medical services, physical barriers such as translucent windows, with only people involved in direct care may enter the room containing COVID-19 patients, using only the required APD for certain tasks, continuing to use the same respirator without taking them off while treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

LINE SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Lighten the load and prepare the future
TANGGAL/SIDE TIME: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LISENSION: CC0: No rights are protected
We find ourselves in a remarkable situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is the thing that makes clear the global human connection and the responsibilities that we have with each other.
We have never faced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the development of a global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern that we have witnessed among all our co-workers through email, calls, and chat is a remarkable validation of extraordinary human beings, which we have been fortunate enough to work with them.
My gratitude and pride are infinitely able to refer to you gentlemen as co-workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how much it means to the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how much it is a powerful symbol for this important resource to remain available online to everyone.
Your work allows this to happen, whether you make sure this site stays running, help pay our colleagues, or help keep our community safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, especially today.
This is the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the next few days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is the appropriate response to the challenges we face and the best way to keep the organization going during this time.
We are eager to remove the pressure and support our mission for the long run.
If you need to reduce the work schedule, that's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work expectancy is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a day off, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission requires you.
However, the world is unpredictable today, and whether you need to care for loved ones, shop for basic needs, or go to a doctor, your well - being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This shouldn't have been necessary, but we said it.
Sick leave or PTO is not necessary, just tell your manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure the major areas of work can be completed.
(If you are diagnosed positive for suffering from COVID-19, please tell Bryan inside T&C Ops so T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets the right attention from management).
Fellows whose hour-based wages will be paid in full.
We've said it, and said it once again, in honor of our commitment to fellow contractors and hour-based staff.
Everyone gets paid based on their regular hours of work when things are normal.
This includes if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel stress toward the world around us.
The work we do can be very rewarding, especially in times like these.
Once again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can take appropriate action.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There's some work to keep going.
SRE, Operation SDM, Trust & Security, as well as the Fund Spending team, among others, do important work that may require additional support.
We will begin the process with all departments to assess the current goals and divert our focus to supporting the essentials for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we'll just focus fully on the most essential project.
Slowing down this moment will be nothing for the future.
We don't plan on working overtime to catch up after this pandemic.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet the current unrealistic deadline.
We realize that the situation is changing and will attempt to set new targets and timelines if necessary.
What about APP?
To adjust to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the timeline for the execution of the 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intent is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to create a budget so that employees can prioritize important jobs, self-care, and care of loved ones while accommodate those who need or want to work with fewer schedules over the next few weeks.
This length of timeline greatly reduces the workload and current planning pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will renew the delegates and the team on the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank the APP team for your leadership on this.
Office status, display and cleanup
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great worry, we hired an antivirus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use hospital-grade antivirus fluids to disinfect every surface, lobby, and all elevators that access our floors.
The building implemented its own safety affirmation protocol using products supporting the safety of its tenants.
We're happy that the office will be ready for use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located at WeWork, which has distributed COVID-19 protocols to us and all staff members based in DC.
Starting last week, our D.C. office has moved into a full long-distance working order, in line with a guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we're also discussing renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still continuing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long - working colleagues realize that this may require adjustments and that they would like to advise you:
Limit the duration of the meeting to an hour or two at most.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into several days.
Define the meeting clearly, set up an agenda, and send out previous reading material.
Make video the default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Show the leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and record the list of speakers, and someone to help make a meeting record (or do collaborative record-making).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your welfare compensation to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to a colleague about a shared job
The SDM Operations Team is seeking webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support increased jobs distributed throughout the Foundation.
This past week we've asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as Edit-a-thon, until the WHO declared the pandemic to be over.
We told them that we understood our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible for them to complete the approved grant activities and that no one would be penalized for having to delay or modify the target.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
In general, the sentiments of the entire global community seem to be grief caused by this disorder, but at the same time relief over the clarity and ability to focus on its own community, both Wikimedia and others.
Forward, CRT is attempting to set up a page in Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for the upcoming Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We'll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and take time to connect.
We're both in this situation and we want to help as best we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from these emails and all the other essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We also try to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly impacted.
If you have questions about travel, events, major workflows, or difficulties regarding coverage, or anything else that may require assistance, feel free to inform and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and be liaisons as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive problem, please email it to Bryan Judian, Director of Global Operations of International SDM.
Let none of these changes be seen as a neglect of our work and obligations.
Instead, this change is a recognition that, today, our work and obligations may need to be adapted in ways we have never done before.
These changes are measures that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support that our movement needs, and give the world the services that they rely on.
The work we planned earlier will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and create space for important work that will come in the next few weeks and perhaps a few months.
We need all of you to make it happen, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can do your best when you need to.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!

b'Angiotensin changer enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of the cell (cell membran) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activity opposite the angiotensin conversion enzyme (ACE), by reducing the number of angiotensin-II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), thus making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into the cell for some coronaviruses.
ACE2 human version is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a zinc-containing metaloenzim located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has a terminal-N M2 peptidase domain and a terminal-C renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, with enzymeatically active domains exposed to cell surfaces in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 extracell domain is separated from the transmembran domain by another enzyme, known as sheddase, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 exists in most organs: ACE2 is attached to cell membranes primarily pulmonary alveolar cells of type II, small bowel enterocytes, arterial endothelial cells and veins, and arterial plain muscle cells in most organs.
Expression of mRNA ACE2 is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stems.
The main function of ACE2 is as an ACE counterbalance.
ACE breaks down the angiotensin hormone I into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the phenylalanine amino acid terminal carboxyl from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, appelin, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates neutral amino acid transporter membrane traffic of SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembran protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into the cell for several coronaviruses, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of S1 proteins on spikes or ridges of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymeatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into endosomes located within the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires priming protein S by serin protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is being investigated today as potential therapy. This fact leads people to hypothesize that a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells may be able to help combat infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend continuing ACE and ARB standard inhibitory therapy.
A systematic review and metaanalysis, published on July 11, 2012, found that the "use of ACE inhibitors led to a significant 34% decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Furthermore, "The use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients who have a higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to increase lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute breath distress syndrome induced by lipoplysaccharide.
The rhACE2 halftime in humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute work awit in addition to its 24 hour (duration) effect length.
Some findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to inhibitors of the classic renin-angiotensin system ( RAS inhibitor) or in diseases with angiotensin II in blood circulation increased. infusion rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute breath distress syndrome.
B'Application COVID-19 is a mobile software application designed to help track contacts to cope with the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, namely the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have made contact with infected people.
Many applications were developed or proposed, which received official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy issues are questioned, primarily relating to systems based on the tracking of the application's user's geographic location.
Alternatives that do not highly infiltrate privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support those Bluetooth-based apps directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, have distributed applications allowing citizens to check if they have contact with COVID-19 sufferers.
This application is used in over 200 Chinese cities, and in Singapore, it is used an app called TraceTogether.
This application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide quick response to health care authorities.
This application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Until April 14, 2020, the app was still awaiting approval of the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that contact tracking applications were in the advanced development stages and would be available to deploy in a few weeks. similar applications were planned in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether application and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce geofencing applications for COVID-19-diagnosed patients living in Moscow; these applications are designed to ensure they do not leave the house.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur on application-based systems, which include false positives and the possibility of lack of effectiveness if the data the application takes is limited to a small percentage of the population alone.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or dangerous "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits on the type of organization that can add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store, which is restricting only to "official" organizations or which have a good reputation.
Google and Amazon implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy supporters voiced their concerns regarding the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, particularly as to whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic would be halted once the threat passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued statements calling for limits on surveillance of this sort.
This organization stated eight conditions on government projects:
Surveillance must be "by law, necessary, and proportional";
The expansion of monitoring and surveillance must have a sunset clause;
data usage must be restricted to COVID-19 purposes;
The security and anonymity of the data must be protected and proven protected based on evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid the more severe the discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with a third party must be defined in the law;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
A meaningful participation of all "relevant interests" is required, which includes public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the constant surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from the device's operating system after it is no longer necessary.
Some countries use network-based location tracking, and not applications, thus eliminating the necessity of downloading applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking is approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with a central server need to access personal location data; a number of systems protecting privacy have been created and use the central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, an app-based system is used to perform contact tracking.
In exchange for using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes cellular device tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to warn of potential contacts, the government also made the information of the location available to the public, which is permitted with extensive changes to information privacy laws after the spread of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using both a centralized system and a system that protects privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, details have not been released.
Contact tracking that protects privacy is an established concept, with a large amount of research literature starting from at least 2013.On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups worked out privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a centralized and decentralized approach, and not a single protocol. decentralized protocols include Nearness Tracking that Protects Decentralized Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, formerly called Contact Genesis Number, CEN), Protocol and Privacy Sensitive Mechanism for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT), etc.
In this protocol, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a platform to use techniques that protect privacy while collecting and using location or data intersection grooves to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar upaya is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, the company that developed privacy technology and was originally also founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and officers without compromising the privacy of the data.
On April 5, 2020, the global TCN Coalition was established by groups that have essentially the same approach and are a much overlapping protocol, with the goal of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for tracking applications and warnings, which is a major aspect of achieving wide acceptance.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Low Energy Bluetooth technology and cryptography that protects privacy.
They also published the core technology specifications used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to launch in three stages:
launch tool to allow government to create an official application tracking coronavirus that protects privacy
The integration of these functions directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple plans to address the problem of continuous data retrieval and surveillance by initially distributing the system through an update of the operating system, then removing it in the same way once the threat passes.
The drug b'Reposition (also called the giving of a new purpose, a new profile, or a new task on a drug or the transition of therapy) is the use of an approved drug for the purpose of a new treatment, namely for a disease or medical condition that differs from the original purpose of drug development.
It is a scientific research path currently being undertaken to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research directions include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and convalescing plasma transfusions. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be drug targets, each protein having several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of such ligand binding sites can be the basis for an effective antivirus drug development project against COVID-19 proteins.
Some of SARS-CoV-2's most important target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent polymerase RNA, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatease.
Hussein A A, et al researched several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed the resemblance of its skeleton to the drug that had been approved and had the highest resemblance in order to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potent drugs in its preclinical studies to be recommended in clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that the associated chloroquines and hydrochlorine were two among the four drugs to be studied as part of Solidarity clinical trials.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that chloroquine and hydrochlorine trials in New York would begin on March 24, and on March 28, the FDA authorised the use of hydroxyloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate based on Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
This treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is authorised based on EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in inap patients, but cannot receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC said that "use, dose, or duration of hydroxyloroquines for prophylactic or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections" has not been established.
Doctors said they used the drug when "there was no other option".
A team of Turkish researchers in Istanbul is conducting a small study of the use of chloroquines combined with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting security trials and the efficacy of preventive use of hydroxyloroquines.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir proved "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in the median of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the number of patients were given favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence to support the drug was little and too early.
On April 2, Germany announced it would purchase the drug from Japan for supplies and use the military to send medicine to university hospitals, where medicine would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made an offer to the Trump government about the purchase of the drug.
The drug may not be safe if it is used by a pregnant mother or a person trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), which is an antivirus combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits are observable".
It is designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding proteases.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to modify a drug to find a compound that will bond with the SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in the scientific society regarding resource direction to reposition drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in international Solidarity trials.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection.
One problem with antivirus treatment is that there is resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe diseases and transmission.
Some early pretest studies suggest remdesivir may have high genetic barriers to resistance. there are some ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospital, which is one for people with moderate illness and another for people who are seriously ill.
There are three clinical trials underway for intravenous vitamin C for people treated with inap and severe COVID-19 disease, namely two controlled placebos (Tiongkok, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
New York State began trials for antibiotic azitromisin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning clinical trials for Alvesco (ciclesonide) Teijin, an inhalation corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of presymtomatic new coronavirus infection patients.
For a form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme, Phase II trials are underway with 200 patients being recruited from severe cases treated in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to learn the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently researching the role of colkicin in reducing inflammatory and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, named COLCORONA, recruited 6000 adults aged 40 and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms so as not to require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use effective contraceptive methods are ineligible.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weighted heparin is widely used to treat patients so as to encourage the Italian Drug Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study on 300 patients researching the use of sodium enoxaparine on prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention is focused on giving the purpose of new treatments on approved and developed antivirus drugs for previous outbreaks, such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to 7th edition Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to 7th edition Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics identified as potentially a drug that can be given a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by China.
Also, trials were conducted in Italy and China, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, there are many efforts being made to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the disease's causative virus, would not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in a Phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread worldwide in 2020, which resulted in large investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The CEPI initiative gave a statement in April that the thing to note in developing vaccines is speed, production capacity, dispersal on the scale needed, as well as global access.
In April, the CEPI lmuwan reported that 10 different technology platforms were in research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform targets that advanced to Phase I security studies, included:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to Milken Institute), and another 37 announced, but with little public information available (considered to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I-II trials conducted early security and immunogenicity tests, usually performed randomly, controlled placebo, and in some locations, while determining more precise effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including control groups, and testing the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent diseases, while monitoring side effects at optimal doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates being actively developed (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 of them are not yet in human evaluation (still in "praclinical" research).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that they were investigating potential molecular clamp vaccines that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reactions.
On January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced that they began developing vaccines, with testing targets in humans in 2021.
The vaccine development project was announced at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they were beginning to develop vaccines.
Janssen worked with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a production partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, OncoGen's laboratory in Romania published a paper on vaccine design with similar technologies to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On 25 March, the head of the research agency announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and would begin testing.
On February 27, 2020, Generex's subsidiary, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced they were starting a vaccine project to create an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce vaccine candidates that can be tested in humans "in 90 days time."
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its project to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical and Supply Research Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were developing a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they were working with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of vaccines.
Furthermore, this partnership announced preclinical testing plans and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced they were working on 11 isolats, and even on fast track, vaccine development took at least about a year and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human testing planned in July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian reported that the U.S. President, Donald Trump, had offered "'a large amount of money' for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company, BioNTech, to jointly develop mRNA-based vaccines.
Currently, the mRNA-based vaccine candidate, BNT162, is in preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced they would get the results of preclinical testing in April 2020 and vaccine candidates who were in the final stages could begin testing in humans in the fall.
On March 19, 2020 in France, the Epidemic Preparedness Innovation Coalition (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, with total CEPI investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine reaching US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six vaccine candidates in animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine that could self-amplify for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving sequences from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced a C$275 million fund for 96 medical countermeasures research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At almost the same time, the Canadian government announced a special C$192 million fund to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccination bank" containing some new vaccine that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurred.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported testing PittCoVacc, a candidate for the COVID-19 vaccine, in mice; they stated that "MNA that gave S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine gave rise to a potent antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that began to look 2 weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy Faculty announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA is designed to replicate within human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate immune systems to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a heterologic effect, called also a nonspecific effect.
That means that these vaccines can have benefits beyond the diseases they prevent.
Further randomized trials in Australia attempted to include 4,170 health officials.
It is possible that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early studies to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, showed the need for damming measures to achieve biological safety level 3 in dealing with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on nonhuman animal models.
By 2020, there has been no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has proved to be safe and effective in humans.
According to the published research papers of 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS became prevalent, existing SARS research was believed to be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there was one MERS (based on DNA) vaccine that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines were in the process, all of which were viral vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vector-MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media postings heralded conspiracy theories claiming the virus behind COVID-19 had been known before and that vaccines had been available.
The patents cited by various social media postings refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus galls, such as coronavirus SARS.
b'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and asphyxiation.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
Time from exposure to symptoms awitans in general is about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and fail compound organs.
By April 17, 2020, over 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territory, resulting in over 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, and the virus is mainly interhuman when close contact occurs, often through sparks or small droplets produced through coughing, sneezing, or while talking.
Although produced while breathing, droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and are not contagious to long distances.
People can also be infected by touching the contaminated surface and then touching the eye, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can last for up to 72 hours.
The virus is highly contagious during the first three days after symptom awitans, although dispersal may occur before symptoms appear and after the subsequent stage of the disease. the standard method of diagnosis is by the reaction of real-time back transcription polymerase chains (rRT-PCR) on nasofaring wipes.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of contracting the virus and those treating it.
Recommendations on the use of masks by the general public differ; some authorities recommend not to use masks, partly recommend their use, and some others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antivirus treatment specific to COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been noted in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be without symptoms or experience flulike symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and asphyxiation.
Emergency symptoms include breathing difficulties, pain or congestion in the constantly chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, and bluish face or lips; medical holding is immediately recommended if these symptoms appear.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneeze, snot, or sore throat can be found, but are rarer.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are observed in diverse percentages.
Some cases in China were initially only with a clinical picture of chestlessness and palpitation.
In some, disease can develop into pneumonia, failure of compound organs, and death.
This time is called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who have experienced symptoms in 11.5 days of infection, reports indicate that not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of carriers without these symptoms in the transmission is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
Currently, a proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms are not yet known and are being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remain without symptoms during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include cases without symptoms in its daily case on 1 April; of the 166 infections of the day, 130 cases (78%) showed no symptoms at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry a load of the virus on a large scale.
Talking out loud releases more sparks or droplets than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs could cause droplets to be pushed up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is usually not transmitted by air, the United States National Academy of Sciences suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur and air collectors placed in hallways outside people's rooms produce positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and lung cardiac resuscitation (RJP), can render breathing secretions transformed into aerosols and then dispersed through the air.
Although there are fears that the virus can spread through the fuses, the risk is believed to be low, the most contagious virus when people travel; even if the spread may occur before symptoms occur, the risk is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say that although it is not yet fully clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on cartons/cardus, for up to three days on plastic (polipropilents) and rust-resistant steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if properly used; soap products outline the protective fat layer of the virus, deactivating the virus, as well as freeing it from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), were less effective.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral payload, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral payload on second-day testing.
Koronavirus heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new heavy acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory disease case cluster in Wuhan.
All new SARS-CoV-2 virus features are in coronaviruses related to nature.
Outside the human body, the virus was killed by household soap, which damaged its protective bubble.
Lungs are the most impacted organs by COVID-19 because viruses access host cells via angiotensin 2 changer enzyme (ACE2), the most abundant in alveolar type II lung cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike or bulge" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injuries were found in 12% of infected people treated inadvants in Wuhan, China, and more often in severe diseases.
Cardiovascular symptoms levels are high due to presence of systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocard injury may also be related to the ACE2 receptor in the heart.
The ACE2 receptor is expressed very high in the heart and is involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and vein thromboembolism (25%) was found in COVID-19 infection patients in the ICU and may be related to poor prognosis. autopsies in people who died of COVID-19 found difusion alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropicme for breath duct epithelial cells that express ACE2, heavy COVID-19 patients have systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
In particular, T cells that secrete pathogenic GM-CSF prove to be correlated with the recruitment of monocytes that secrete IL-6 inflammatory and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Infiltrate lymphocytes were also reported on autopsies.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is the reaction of real-time back transcriptional polymerase chain (rRT-PCR).
These tests are usually performed on respiratory samples obtained through nasofaring wipers; however, nasal or sputum wipe samples can also be used.
Generally, results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood testing can be used, but requires two blood samples taken at a distance of two weeks so that the results have a small time value.
Chinese scientists are able to isolate this coronavirus gall and publish its genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world can develop independent polymerase chain reaction testing (PCR) to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if one has been infected before) are under development, but have not been widely used.
China's experience with the testing showed only 60 to 70% accuracy.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care testing on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. diagnosis guidelines released by Zhongnan University Wuhan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical imagery and epidemiological risks.
Bilateral ground-glass multilobar opacity with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distributions is widely encountered early in the infection.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving (lobular septum embedding with alveolar filling varies), and consolidation can appear as the disease progresses.
Little data is available about microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological findings on the autopsy were:
Macroscopy: pleurition, pericarditis, lung consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four strains of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Light pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypis pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphositic infiltration, and numerous core giant cell formations
Heavy pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudate.
DAD is the cause of acute breathing syndrome (ARDS) and heavy hypoxemia.
pneumonia in the healing stage: exudate arrangement in the alveolar cavity and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation of diseminata (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends the use of the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
An appropriate hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of facial covering from fabrics in public places, partly to limit transmission by people without symptoms. the social restriction strategy aims to reduce contact of infected people with many people, by way of closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public places.
Restriction guidelines also include people keeping a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 metres.
No drug has yet been known to be effective preventing COVID-19. Since vaccines are anticipated to not exist until early 2021, the main part in dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as "flating curves".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after from the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating, as well as after breaking through the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Furthermore the CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand analytics containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial hand analysing is unavailable, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antiception".
Glycerol was added as a humectant.
People are dealt with support care, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other impacted vital organs.
The CDC recommends people who suspect they're carrying a virus to wear simple face masks.
Extraporeum membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure problems, but the benefits are still considered.
Self-cleanness and lifestyle and healthy diets are recommended to increase immunity.
Supportive care may be useful in people who have mild symptoms in the early stages of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to deal with inadjusted COVID-19 sufferers.
Intensive care experts and lung experts in the U.S. have drafted treatment recommendations from various agencies into free resources, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel more recommend paracetamol (asetamineofen) than ibuprofen for first line use.
Preventive measures must be taken to minimize the risk of viral transmission, especially in the health care order when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health workers who care for COVID-19 sufferers, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Tular-Udara Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and tular-air precautions. CDC outlines guidelines for the use of self-protective tools (APD) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: APD robes, respirators or face masks, eye armor, and medical gloves. If available, respirators (not face masks) are better.
Respirator N95 was approved for the industrial order, but the FDA has authorised this mask to be used based on the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Respirators N95 are designed to protect against air-borne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use not mentioned on the label.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial armor or, as a final attempt, homemade masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not too heavy until they require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but partly cases are heavy indeed.
The type of respiratory support for people experiencing COVID-19-related breath failure is being actively studied for inap treatment people, and there is evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal canula or bipositive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods produce the same benefits for critically ill people.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal canulas.
Many developed countries do not have adequate per capita hospital beds, which limit the capacity of the health system to deal with sudden surges in the number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% entered intensive care units, 2.3% required mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of inpatient COVID-19 sufferers eventually enter the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as acute breathing (ARDS) syndrome occurs in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators capable of pressure control modes and high PEEPs are required to maximize oxygen delivery at the same time minimizing the risk of lung injury and ventilator-related pneumotorax.
High PEEPs may not be available on old ventilators.
Research on potential treatment began in January 2020 and some antivirus drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems the most promising.
Although new drug development may take up to 2021, some drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antivirus drugs can be tried in people with severe disease.
Recommended volunteers of the WHO participate in potential treatment effectiveness and security trials. the FDA has provided temporary authorization for convalescing plasma as an experimental treatment in the case of a person's very or immediately threatened life.
Convalescent plasma has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to prove its security and effectiveness for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
These applications are able to detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so that they can detect potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If potential risks are detected, applications not only recommend self-imposed quarantine, but also notify local health officials, mahadata analytics on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track cell phone data of people suspected of contracting coronavirus.
The move was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people who might be in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed an aggregate of phone location data to the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia uses facial recognition technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was told cellphone operators that "40% of citizens still keep moving places".
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience pressure caused by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and economic downturn is a perfect storm that endangers people's mental health and well-being."
The disease can take place mildly with little or no symptoms, which resemble other common upper breathway diseases, such as colds.
A mild case usually heals in two weeks, while those suffering from severe or critical illness may require three to six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk for heavy COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still lacking. in some people, COVID-19 can affect lungs thus causing pneumonia.
In the most severely impacted person, COVID-19 can quickly develop into acute breathlessness syndrome (ARDS) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or compound organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, particularly prothrombin time increases, were observed in 6% of inap-treated COVID-19 patients, while kidney function abnormalities were seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 images showed increased liver enzymes (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between awitan symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study researching early cases, the median time ranging from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full span of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a 2.8% mortality rate, while women had a 1.7% mortality rate.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromicsoid exudates in both lungs.
Cytopatic changes in the virus are observable in pneumocytes.
The lung image resembles acute breather syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage is observable, with increased levels of troponin or heart stop.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people treated inap have built-in conditions, medical and social resource availability of an area's economy can also influence mortality.
Estimates of the mortality of the conditions vary due to the difference in the region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Lack of a light case count can cause the death toll to be calculated too high.
However, the fact that death is a result of cases taking place in the past can mean the current mortality figure is calculated to be too low.
Smokers have a 1.4 times greater likelihood of experiencing severe COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. there are concerns about the long-term sequela of the disease.
Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a 20% to 30% lung capacity drop in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also lead to postcare-intensive syndrome after healing.
As of March 2020, it is not yet known that prior infections provide effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely to be obtained, if it looks at other coronavirus behaviors, but has been reported to have cured cases of COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests a few days after.
The case is believed to be a deteriorating remnant infection, and not a re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and derived from animals, through a spreading infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection is almost entirely driven by transmission from humans to humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest symptom awitan date was December 1, 2019.
Official publication from WHO reported the earliest symptoms awitan on December 8, 2019.
Generally, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This figure varies by region and over time, as well as is influenced by the number of testing, quality of health care systems, handling options, time since the first outbreak, and population characters such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO established the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV-2 infection.The ratio of deaths to cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a specified time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the ratio of death to cases globally was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measurements include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the fatality rate of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) people who died from certain diseases.
These statistics are not time bound and follow a particular population from infection to case resolution.
Although not everyone infected makes antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people infected.
In the episenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village containing 4600 citizens, 80 (1.7%) is dead.
In Gangelt, the disease is spread through the Carnival festival, which spreads among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and possibly not all COVID-19 deaths are classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Furthermore, Germany's health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied from blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) were confrimated dying of COVID-19.
The effects of the pandemic and its mortality rates are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the risk difference between men and women only not apparent in their 90s.
In China, the death toll for men was 2.8 percent and for women was 1.7 percent.
The exact reason for this gender-based difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences based on gender, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men who have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were men and 72% of those who died of COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government did not track sex-related data for COVID-19 infections.
Studies suggest that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, influence men and women differently.
The percentage of health officials of female gender is higher, particularly nurses, and they have a higher chance of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to certain geographic locations (e.g. China), animal species, or a group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatization. the virus that causes COVID-19 is named coronavirus heavy acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "viruses responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronaviruses".
At the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the "coronavirus" and the "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as temporary names for viruses and diseases according to the 2015 guidelines implicating not to use location names in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print health care materials such as nasal wipes and ventilator components.
In one instance, when an Italian hospital desperately needs a ventilator valve, and suppliers cannot deliver in the required time scale, a local company reverse-engineers and prints the required 100 valves overnight.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, conspiracy theories, misinformation, and disinformation sprang up regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread quickly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drug or vaccine has yet been approved to treat the disease.
International research into COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to study the effects of treatment of four existing antivirus compounds with the most promising efficacy.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous studies of SARS-CoV were used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both used ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
There are three vaccinations strategies under study.
First, researchers aim to make the virus vaccine whole.
The use of the virus, either an inactive or dead virus, aims to quickly trigger the human body's immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits in the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on S-spike proteins that helped the virus infiltrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (a DNA vaccine or RNA, a new technique for making vaccinations).
Experimental vaccines made with these strategies had to be tested for safety and efficacy, and on March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccines containing harmless genetic codes copied from viruses that cause disease. antibodious-dependent increases have been suggested as a potential challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials ongoing in April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated treatments that have been approved for malaria, including four studies of hydroxyloroquines or chloroquines.
The new purpose-given antivirus drug forms most of China's research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in some countries with reporting deadlines in late April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs already exists. Some existing antivirus drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, which includes remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxyloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvements are observable in patients treated with remdesivir in emergency medicine.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China, and Italy.
However, there was a call for peer review of the research.
The Korean and Chinese Health Authority recommended the use of chloroquines.
However, the Wuhan Virological Institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, noted that double doses were extremely dangerous and could be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxyloroquines and chloroquines over physician policies treating COVID-19 sufferers. The 7th edition Chinese guide also included interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Early data showed that high doses of ribavirin were necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in low concentrations. Research suggests that early priming of bulging proteins by transmembranian serin protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquines and hydroxyloroquines with or without azitromicin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Complications of cytokine storms can occur in advanced stage COVID-19 weight.
There is evidence that hydroxyloroquines may have antisytokin properties. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing phase 2 nonacak test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify cytokine storms, the drug is intended to counter a cytokine storm, which is thought to be the cause of death in some of the impacted people.
In 2017, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid refraction cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there has been no random and controlled evidence suggesting that tocilizumab is a effective treatment for CRS.
Transfers of refined and focused antibodies produced by a system of cured people from COVID-19 to people who need them are being studied as a method of passive immunization of nonvaccine.
This strategy was attempted for SARS with no conclusive results.
Virus Neutralization is a working mechanism expected for passive antibody therapy can mediate defenses against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytotoxicity that depend on antibodies and/or phagocytosis, are also possible.
Another form of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies produced, is in development.
Convalesian serum production, which is a fluid part of the patient's cured blood and contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after bringing up awareness of the spread of the virus.
