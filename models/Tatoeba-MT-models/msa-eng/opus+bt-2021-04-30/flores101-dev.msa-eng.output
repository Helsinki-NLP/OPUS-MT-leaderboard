"This CCTV will certainly send a clear signal to people working with animals that the welfare of this animal is the highest priority."
A map of the United States Geological Studies earthquake showed no earthquakes in Iceland the week before.
The Iceland Meteorological Office also reported no earthquake activity in the Hekla area within 48 hours.
The significant activity of the quake resulted in changes in the phase that had occurred on March 10 to the northeast of the volcano's summit caldera.
The appearance of dark clouds unrelated to any activity of the volcano has been seen at the base of the mountain.
Clouds indicate the potential confusion to whether an eruption actually occurred.

Karno is a well-known English tutor but has a controversy with teaching Moden Education and King Glory who claims to have 9,000 students at the top of his career.
In her notes she used words in which the parents considered rude, and she reportedly used profanity in the classroom.
Modern education has accused him of printing large summary on buses without being authorized and lying by saying he's the Chief English Tutor.
He was also accused before copyright infringement, but was not charged.
A former student said that he 'used an accent in class, taught pairing skills in notes, and looked like a student friend.'
Over the last three decades, although officially still a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic renewal has been made under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economy has increased by 90 times.
For the first time, last year China exported more cars from Germany and passed the United States as the largest market in the industry.
China's KDNK is capable of overcoming the United States in two decades.
Tropika Danielle, the fourth storm to have been named in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
This storm, which is about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, has sustained winds at 40 mph (64 kmj).
Scientists at the National Center of Typhoon predicted that Danielle would grow faster and be classified as a hurricane on Wednesday.
Since the storm is far from land, it remains difficult to assess the potential effects on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, Bobek became famous when playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined them in 1945 and remained with them until 1958.
While he was with the team in question, he scored 403 goals in 468 appearances.
No one has ever performed more or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995 he was voted the best player in the history of Partizan.
The celebration began with a special presentation by the world - renowned Cirque du Soleil group.
He was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, the Janissary kugiran as well as singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then Whirling Dervishes had come to the stage.

"Good luck nothing happened to me, but I witnessed a terrible event, when people tried to break the window to get out.
People are hitting the window panel using a chair but the next window can't be broken.
One of the panels eventually broke down and they started out through the window," said Franciszek Kowal who survived.
Stars emit light and heat due to the energy produced when hydrogen atoms merge (or merge) with each other to form heavier elements.
Scientists are focused on creating reactors that can generate energy in the same way.
But this is a very difficult problem to solve and it'll take years before we see a useful recyclable reactor built.
The steel needle floats on the surface of the water caused by surface voltage.
The surface voltage occurs because the water molecules on the water surface are more attracted to each other than the air molecules above them.
Water molecules make an invisible layer on the surface of the water that causes a needlelike item to float on water.
Modern ice skate blades have two curved corners of the curve between them.
Because the underside of the knife is slightly curved, when the knife is tilted to one side to the other, the edge that touches the ice is also curved.
This causes the skater to spin. If the skater tilts to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skater tilts to the left, the skater will turn to the left.
To get back to the previous energy level, they have to get rid of the energy they've gained from the light.
They do this by extracting a small, glowing particle called a "photon".
Scientists call this process "a release of stimulated radiation" because atoms are stimulated by bright light, causing the release of light photons, and light is a kind of beam.
The next picture shows an atom emitting photons, and in reality the photons are much smaller than the ones shown in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the elements that make up the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of filament operations in the menthol will eventually burn and the menthol will no longer function.
It's important to be careful when replacing the bulb.
First of all, the switch for the lights needs to be turned off or the cable is severed.
This is because electricity flows into a socket where the metal part that has a bulb can give you a serious electrical shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the base of the metal bulb while part of it is still inside the socket.
The main organ in the circulatory system is the heart pumping blood.
The blood flows from the heart in a channel called the artery and back to the heart in a channel called the vein.
Triceratop teeth can not only destroy leaves but also hard branches and roots of trees.
Some scientists think that Triceratops ate cycad, which was a common plant in Cretaceous times.
These plants look like small palm trees with crowns composed of sharp, spotty leaves.
Triceratops may use its strong beak to carve leaves before eating tree trunks.
Other scientists think that these plants are highly toxic so it can't be any dinosaur eating them, even though today sloths and other animals like parrots (the dinosaur offspring) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you're standing on the surface of Io, your weight is lower than your weight on Earth.
Someone who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth will weigh 36 pounds (16kg) in Io.
The sun has no crust like the earth where you can stand, the whole sun is made of gas, fire and plasma.
Gas is running low as we keep moving further away from the center of the Sun.
The outside we see when we see the Sun is called photospherical, which means "lightball".
Some three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that the planet Zuhrah had phases, just like the moon.
The phases occur because only the part of Venus (or the moon) facing the sun will be bright.
Then, a few years after this in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed the movement of the planet Zuhrah.
England has experienced a long period of peace after beating back from Danelaw.
But by 991, Ethelred had faced a larger Viking fleet than any other since Guthrum a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, the Norwegians with the ideal of demanding the return of his country rather than the mastery of Denmark.
After some military troubles, Ethelred has agreed to the terms of Olaf, who has returned to Norway and tried to sue his kingdom with mixed victories.
Hangeul was the only alphabet deliberately created in daily use, which was created in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418 - 1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty and was one of the most respected.
Originally he referred to the Hanguel alphabet as Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "right sound for education".
There are various theories of the existence of Sanskrit, one of which is about the migration of Aryans from the west of India bringing together their language.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that corresponds to the Latin spoken in Europe.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the creation of the Upanishad text, the existence of Sanskrit faded further because of the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language and has served as a source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin became a source of European for example French and Spanish.
With the battle for France over, the Germans began to prepare to attack the island in Britain.
The Germans named the attack code "Operation Sea Lion." Most of the weapons and heavy supplies of the British Army were lost when it was moved from Dunkirk, which left the army quite weak.
But the Royal Navy was much stronger than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.
However, many of the Royal Navy's ships near the breach route as admirals feared it would be sunk by German airstrikes.
Let's start with the explanation of the Italian plan, Italy is Germany's "sister" and Japan's.
It had weaker armies and weaker naval forces, even though they had just built four new ships before the start of the war.
Italy's main goal is to focus on African countries, and to capture those countries, they need to have a military deployment, so that soldiers can sail across the Mediterranean and attack Africa.
To do so, they were forced to expel Britain’s bases and ships in Egypt, and in addition to their actions, Italian warships were not supposed to do anything else.
Japan is an island nation, just like Britain.
A submarine is a ship designed to travel underwater, and stay there for a long time.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II, at which point they were extremely slow and firing ranges were very limited.
At the start of the war they roamed a great deal over the sea, but when the radar grew and became more precise the submarine had to go underwater to avoid being seen.
German submarines are known as U. The Germans are very good at navigating and operating their submarines.
Because of its success with submarines, after the war, the possession of many submarines in German hands was alarming.
King Tutankhamun, sometimes called "King Tut" or "King of Children", was one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt in modern times.
Interestingly, he was not considered very important in ancient times and was not listed on most ancient king lists.
Nevertheless, the discovery of his grave in 1922 made him a celebrity, and while many ancient graves were robbed, the tomb was not disturbed.
A large number of items planted with Tutankhamun have been well cared for, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and nadir stones.
The invention of the fingered wheel made the Assyrian chariot lighter, faster, and more ready to pursue soldiers and other chariots.
The arrows from their dangerous bows penetrated the opposing army's shields about 1000 B.C., Assyria introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry were an army that fought on horseback, and the saddle was not yet created, so the Assyrian cavalry fought without saddles.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists, and artists, but perhaps the most famous of these cultures is Homer, the legendary blind poet who made up two works of Greek literature: the Iliad and the Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still famous playwrights and their plays are considered among the best works in the world of literature.
Another famous Greek was the mathematician Pythagoras, most famous for his famous theorem about the relationship between the sides of the right triangle.
There are various estimates of the number of people who speak Hindi, and it is estimated to be between the second and fourth most widely spoken languages in the world.
The number of native speakers differ depending on whether or not the log message is related is calculated.
The estimated total is 340 million to 500 million speakers, and as many as 800 million people can understand this language.
Hindi and Urdu are the same in terms of vocabulary, but different in terms of scripts; in daily conversations, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia came under the strong influence of German culture.
Some German friars wanted to draw God closer to the local people, and they invented the Estonian language.
It is based on the German alphabet and one "greeting/õ" character added.
Over time, many words borrowed from the German language were put together.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne will continue to join the army after the end of the day.
However, Charles attended university at Trinity College, Cambridge where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, and then History, earning 2:2 (second class undergraduate).
Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to receive a degree.
European Turkey (Thrace east or Rumelia in the Balkan peninsula) makes up 3% of the country.
Turkey has a length of over 1,600 kilometres (1,000 mi) and a width of 800 km (500 mi), with a roughly rectangular shape.
The Turkish area, including the lake, inhabits 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square meters), which is 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square meters) in southwestern Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 square meters) in Europe.
Turkey's vastness makes it the 37th largest country in the world, and its size is like the Metropolitan of France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is encircled by the sea on three sides, the Aegean Sea on the west, the Black Sea on the north and the Mediterranean Sea on the south.
Luxembourg has a long history but its independence dates back to 1839.
The present part of Belgium was part of Luxemboug in the past but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
Luxembourg always sought to remain as a neutral country but was occupied by the Germans in World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became the founding member of the organization now known as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong was a ruined fortress and Buddhist monastery at the top of Paro County (in Phondey Village).
It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan-Mongol army.
In 1951, a fire caused only a few Drukgyal Dzong relics to be left behind, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was maintained and protected, and remained as one of Bhutan’s most exciting attractions.
In the 18th century, Cambodia got itself pinned between two powerful neighbors, Thai and Vietnamese.
Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and had annihilated Phnom Penh in 1772.
In the last years of the 18th century, Vietnam has also colonized Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of them have jobs in informal economies.
Two-thirds of the Venezuelan working class work in the service sector, almost one-quarter working in the industrial sector and one-fifth in the agricultural sector.
The most important industry for the people of Venezuela is oil, where the country is a clean exporter, even if only one percent is working in the oil industry.

And then back north from the west, once again across the Mara river after the rain stopped around April.
The Serengeti area consists of Serengeti State Park, Ngorongoro Maintenance Area and Maswa Save Forest in Tanzania and Maasai Mara National Save Forest in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, in addition to tools mastered in interactive classes (those storyboards, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires that you reevaluate your expectations of media production and learn to think nonlinearly.
Interactive design requires components of a project to connect to one another, as well as to function as separate entities.
The lack of zoom lenses is a focal complexity and the number of lens elements needed to reach a wider focal length than for the prime lens.
This is less of an issue because lens manufacturers have achieved higher standards in lens production.
This has allowed the zoom lens to produce images of quality corresponding to those achieved by the lens with fixed focal distance.
Another weakness for zoom lenses is that the maximum opening (speed) of the lens is generally lower.
This makes cheap precious zoom lenses difficult to use at low lighting conditions without camera light.
One of the most common problems is when trying to convert a film into a DVD format is overscan.
Most televisions are made in one way or another to make it easier for the public.
Therefore, everything you can see on TV has cut its frame, top, bottom and edge.
This is to ensure that the appropriate image covers the entire screen. This is called "overscan"
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, its edges will probably be cut too, and if the video has a subtitle too close at the bottom, they won't be fully shown.
The traditional medieval castle has long been an inspiration to the imagination that carries the memory of spear-fighting sports, banquets and knighthoods of Arthur’s time.
While standing in the midst of thousands of years of rubble it is easy to bring the sound and smell of the old fighting that passes, to the point that it almost hears nails stretched out on pebbles and the growing smell of fear in prison holes.
But is our imagination based on reality, and why was it built in its origin, and how was it designed and built?
Typically for that period, Kirby Muxloe Palace was more than a fortified house from a real palace.
Big glass windows and thin walls won't be able to resist a severe attack for long.
In the 1480s, when the construction was newly started by Lord Hastings, the country was still secure and the defense was only necessary to fight a small group of pirates.
The balance of power is a system in which European countries strive to maintain the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept is that all European countries must strive to prevent one country from becoming powerful, and therefore national governments often change their alliances to maintain balance.
The Spanish war of inheritance signaled the first war in which the balance of power was the first question.
This marked an important change because the European powers could no longer use religious warfare as an excuse, so the Thirty Years' War was the last so-called religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C.E., as a result of the deliberate burning of Herostratus.
According to the story, the motivation is all well known, the Ephesian party in its rage announced that the name Herostratus was never recorded.
Greek historian Strabo later declared that name, as we know it today, the temple was destroyed the same night Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander, as king, offered to accommodate the cost of rebuilding the temple, but his offer was rejected, and after Alexander’s death the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.
Keep your hands as calm as they can while still pressing all the marks correctly - otherwise, try not to make any external movements with your fingers.
In this way, you will tire yourself out as little as possible, remembering that you do not have to use as much energy to press a key to get a loud sound like a piano.
In accordions, for additional volume gain, you use beloss at a higher pressure or speed.
Misticism is an attempt to unite with, identity with, or awareness of reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
A believer seeks experience, instinct or a direct understanding of the nature of gods or gods.
Followers carry on a certain way of life, or practice that aims to improve their experience.

Sikhism is a religion of the small continent of India, which originated in the Punjab region in the 15th century from the division of the mazhab within the Hindu tradition.
Sikhs consider their beliefs to be a religion separate from Hinduism even though they recognize Hindu roots and traditions.
The Sikhs called their religion Gurmat, "the way of a teacher" in Pujab.
It was founded by Guru Nanak in the 15th century (1469-1539).Then followed nine teachers in a row.
Nevertheless, in June 1956, Krushchev's promises were challenged during riots in Poland which led to laborers pointing to feelings of denial of food shortages and pay cuts, which exchanged to a general objection against Communism.
Although in the end, Krushchev sent a tank to restore order, he agreed to some economic demands and to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley civilization is a Bronze Age civilization on the small northwestern continent of India that includes most of modern Pakistan and some areas of northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan.
Civilizations sowed in the Indus River basin because of the original musabab of its name.
Although some scholars speculate that because the civilization also existed in the now dry Sarasvati River valley, it should be called Tamadun Indus-Sarasvati, while some call it Tamadun Harappan sempena Harappa, the first site excavated in the 1920s.
The military nature of the Greek empire has helped in the development of medical advances.
The doctor was recruited by Emperor Augustus and also formed the first medical company in Rome to deal with war casualties.
Surgeons have a knowledge of different types of sedatives including morphine from poppy seed starches and scopolamine from herbal seeds.
They became proficient in amputations to save patients from gangrene as well as the installation of anduh cloths and arterial clamps to contain blood flow.
For centuries, the Roman Empire made great progress in medicine and has formed much knowledge that we know now.
Pureland origami is origami with only one limit that can be done at a time, more complicated folds like reverse folds are not allowed, and all folds have an easy location.
This was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to assist with inexperienced folding or anyone with limited motor skills.
Children developed a consciousness about racialism and racial stereotypes at a young age, and those racial stereotypes had an effect on behavior.
For example, children who recognize themselves as being of one minoritystereotapized as not showing good performance at school tend not to show good achievement at school when they learn about stereotypes associated with their nation.
MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and there are 54 million profiles at this time.
The website received much attention, especially from educational eaters.
There are positive aspects to this website, including, being able to easily organize class pages that can include blogs, videos, pictures and other features.
This page can be easily accessed by giving only one web address, which makes it easy to remember and easy to type by a student who may encounter problems with a keyboard or spelling.
It can be adjusted to make it easy to read and also to color as much or as little as it needs to be.
Attention deficit disorder "is a classic neurological syndrome showing a symptom triad that includes impulsive, easily distracted, and hyperactive or overpowered".
It's not a learning disability, it's a learning disorder; it affects 3 to 5 percent of all children, maybe as many as 2 million American children.
Children with ADD are hard to focus on such things as schoolwork, but they can concentrate on things they like like like playing games or watching their favorite cartoons or writing verses without punctuation.
These children tend to deal with a lot of problems, because they engage in risky behavior, easily fought, and challenge the authorities "to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated by normal methods".
ADD affects relationships with other peers because other children don't understand why they behave differently or abnormally the way they spell or the difference in their maturity.
Because the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn has changed as stated above, the fundamental rate at which knowledge is acquired has changed.
The approach to getting information is different. Pressure is no longer in the person's memory, but the ability to recall text is more focused.
Essentially, the Renaissance made important changes in approach to learning and the spread of science.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands when moving or carrying loads or swinging from tree to tree.
The hands and feet of a chimpanzee are of the same size and length, indicating the use of the hands to carry the load while walking with the knuckles.
The human hand is shorter than the foot, with a straighter flanx bone.
The bones of fossils aged two million to three million reveal a hand-specific transition from movement to manipulation.
Some people believe that having artificially vivid dreams is often very tiring.
The main cause of this phenomenon is the result of a vivid dream that lengthens the time between REM sleep states.
REM decreases each night, and you get a good night’s sleep, and your body is getting better and less frequent problems.
It's as tired as we wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
The effect is depending on the frequency of the brain you try to dream clearly every night.
Things didn't work out for the Italians in North Africa in the first place in a week after the Italian declaration of war on 10 June, 1940, the British 11 Hussars seized Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush in eastern Bardia, the British captured General Lastucci, chief engineer of the Tenth Italian Army.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, Governor General of Libya and heir to Mussolini, was killed by gunfire when landing in Tobruk.
Modern sword - fighting sports are played at various levels, from students studying them at university to professional and Olympic competitions.
This sport is mainly played in fight format, one player spinning the other.
Golf is a game where the player uses a skewer to hit the ball into the hole.
Eighteen holes are played during regular rounds, usually the player will start the game at the first hole in the golf course and end up at the eighth hole.
The player who takes a bit of a punch, or a swing, to complete the course.
The game is played over grass, and the grass around the hole is cut shorter and called "green"
The most common type of travel is the type most people associate with vacations: Recreational travel.
This is when people go to a very different place than their normal everyday life for rest and fun.
Beaches, theme parks and campgrounds became the most frequent places visited by recreational travelers.
If the objective of one's visit to a certain place is to know its history and culture, with this it is a type of travel known as cultural travel.
Travelers can visit different landmarks in a specific country or they can choose to focus on just one area.
The colonists, after witnessing this activity, also called for reinforcements.
The army that strengthened the front ranks included the first and third regiments of New Hampshire containing 200 members, under Colonel John Stark and Colonel James Reed (they both later became generals).
Stark soldiers took up positions along the fence in the northern position of the Colonists.
When the waters receded having opened a gap along the Mystic River along the northeastern peninsula, they had quickly lengthened the fence with a short stone wall leading north and ended up on the waterfront on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark laid a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ruled that no one opened fire until the passer through.
The American plan relies on launching a coordinated attack from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder will launch a diversionary attack against the British line at Bordentown, to block reinforcements.
General James Ewing will take 700 militias across the river at Trenton Feri, seize the bridge on the Assunpink creek and prevent any enemy forces from escaping.
The main attack force of 2,400 soldiers would cross a river located 9 miles north of Trenton, and then divide into two groups, under the leadership of Greene and Sullivan respectively, to launch an attack before dawn.
With the change from a quarter mile to a half-mile run, speed becomes less important and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course the first-class half-mile runner, one who can afford less than two minutes, has quite a high speed, but endurance must be cultivated in all dangerous circumstances.
Crossing the village in the winter, combined with gymnasium exercise for the top of the body is the best setup for the running season.
The practice of eating properly alone cannot guarantee elite performance, but it can affect the welfare of young athletes as a whole.
Maintaining a healthy balance of energy, practicing effective drinking water habits and understanding the various aspects of additional food practices can help athletes improve their presentations and increase their interest in sports that are affected.
Simple - distance running is a fairly cheap sport; however, there are many wrong notions about the small amount of equipment needed to partake.
Products can be purchased if necessary, but most will have little or no effect at all on performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even if it does not really benefit them.
Atom can be considered one of the basic building blocks of all matter.
It's a very complex entity consisting of a simplified Bohr model, the central nucleus is orbited by electrons, the same as the planets orbiting the sun - see Diagram 1.1.
Nucleus is composed of two particles: neutrons and protons.
Protons have positive electrical charges while neutrons don't have charges.
To check the circumstances of your victims you must review the scene first to ensure your safety.
You have to observe the victim's position as you approach it and any automatic danger warnings.
If you have been hurt by trying to help, you may be making things worse.
Research has found that depression, fear, and the thought that things are worse than they actually have to do with pain and disability in back sick patients.
Just the impression of disaster thinking, not depression and fear that depends on regular weekly structured PA sessions.
Those who participate in ordinary activities need more support in terms of negative perception of pain alienating the difference in chronic pain and the sense of discomfort from normal physical movement.
The vision, or ability to see, depends on the visual system of the sensory organ or the eye.
There are many different developmental views, the shock of complexity depending on the conditions of the organism.
Different constructions have different capabilities, are sensitive to long wave differences and have different degrees of sharpness, and they also require different processing to understand different inputs and numbers to work optimally.
A population is a group of organisms of a particular species within a specified geographical area.
When all individuals in the population are equal to taking into account certain phenotyping properties, they are known as monomorphics.
When individuals show some variation of their particular traits they are polymorphic.
Colonies of ant soldiers swarm and also nest in different phases.
In the nomadic phase, the military ants move at night and stop resting during the day.
The colony begins the nomad phase when food is ready to decrease.
Each episode of this rage or nomad march lasted for approximately 17 days.
The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella," which means "little room," and it's named by a microscoper who's watching the cork structure.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
Cells are very basic and important to the study of life, in fact, they are often referred to as "the foundations of life."
The nerve system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses throughout the body to ensure uninterrupted blood flow.
These neural impulses can be transmitted so quickly throughout the body that they help protect the body from any possible threat.
Tornadoes strike smaller areas than any other storm, but they can destroy everything that collides with them.
The tornado pulled out trees, damaged buildings and flew cars, and two percent of the most violent tornadoes took place over three hours.
This violent storm blew up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
