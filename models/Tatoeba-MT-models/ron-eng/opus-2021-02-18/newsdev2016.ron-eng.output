Former head of Brazilian presidential cabinet brought to court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted charges against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for his alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme involving the state oil company Petrobras.
The federal prosecutor's office said Jose Dirceu would be sued for allegations of corruption, fraud and money laundering brought this month.
Fourteen others will be tried, including Joao Vaccari Neto, former Treasurer of the Workers' Party, in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, former president of Petrobras' business services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the ruling Workers' Party taken into custody for ties to this scheme.
Dirceu served as chief of staff of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested in early August at home, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a scheme to buy votes in Congress more than 10 years ago.
Prosecutors said Dirceu developed the bribe-making scheme at Petrobras, accepted bribes while in office and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after being closed in late 2013 for the vote-buying scandal.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved about $2 billion in bribes and other illegal funds.
Part of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and its allies.
It would also include bribes to Petrobras directors in exchange for inflated contracts.
"Miracle" recovery of a surviving student of the Peshawar massacre
A paralysed teenager after being shot four times in Pakistan's worst terrorist attack succeeded in a "miraculous" recovery after receiving treatment in the United Kingdom.
To 13-year-old Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, doctors in Pakistan had told him that he would never be able to walk again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the Peshawar public school last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be discharged from the hospital later.
Exactly nine months ago, on an ordinary Tuesday morning, Mohamed sat in first aid class and listened carefully to his teachers.
Right then, seven armed men disguised as security guards entered the army's public school.
They wore explosive belts and had a simple mission to do: to kill all the men, women and children who came their way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," Mohamed says with a sharp look.
I was sitting in the auditorium, asking questions... and then I heard gunshots outside.
The terrorists went inside and started killing. Our teacher was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he pulled four students out of the amphitheater while the carnage was taking place.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, calling out to him.
He said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held his hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he was shot in the head.
Most of those killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Muhammad's arms.
Mohamed remembers that right after that he passed out and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the waist down.
The doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then those in Rawalpindi, near the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to walk again.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul come out," says Sher Khan, Muhammad's father.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son could never use his legs again.
They campaigned for help from Pakistani television, attracting the support of famous people like Imran Khan, a cricket player who became a politician.
Eventually, they managed to raise funds to take Muhammad to the United Kingdom and offer him treatment at the private Harley Street clinic in London.
Neurosurgeon consultant Irfan Malik described Muhammad as "scared" when he arrived at the hospital.
"He had spent the last few months lying in bed, unable to move from side to side, says Malik.
He was weak, there was a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in good shape.
A vertebra at the base of Muhammad's spine had been destroyed
Mohamed had been shot in the shoulder, hip, and back during the attack, and his lower spine had been destroyed, resulting in paralysis.
But during a six-hour operation, Malik and his team were able to retrace the nerve endings and rebuild the damaged part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Just a week after the operation, Mohamed got up and started taking steps and walking.
We didn't expect such a good result.
It was a miracle," he says.
Within two weeks of the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and begin the long recovery process.
Mohamed defied fate and began to walk again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the UK.
But he is determined to return to Pakistan, join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel like I still have a chance at life," he says, showing pictures of guns he drew next to school textbooks and pens
Physically, Mohamed is getting stronger every day, but the psychological trauma he's going through and now it's unimaginable.
"My anger has not fallen," he confesses.
Little kids were killed in my school.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes off a tear, caresses the head, and says, "I see my son walking again."
He will be able to continue his life naturally.
The 4G "Super Voice" service at Three gives better signal
Three uses a lower frequency 4G spectrum that can cover a wider area
Mobile phone provider Three has launched a service in the UK that says it will improve reception inside buildings and in rural areas without a signal.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a lower frequency spectrum.
Other networks also plan to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (Volte)".
It currently only works with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the coming months.
Three mentions that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to the service by 2017.
Chief Technology Officer Bryn Jones said: "By the end of the year, one million of our clients will have access to better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more places than they have been before".
The stars are preparing for the pantomime season
Pantomime is very important for theatres throughout the UK, many of which are now preparing for this year's season.
Now, some of the biggest names in showbusiness are attending the Christmas theater.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Cinderella - the first in the role of one of the evil sisters and the second in the role of the fairy.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: "If I don't do anything, I feel guilty."
Steven Wilson has recently been named the Grand Winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has often been called the most hardworking musician in the progressive rock world.
The talented musician won three awards at the Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the Best Album Award of the Year for Hand.
In his five-star review, The Guardian called the album "a work of intelligent, expressive and captivating art".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of several musical projects, the best known being the rock band Porcupine Tree.
Now, before two indoor shows at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double vinyl LP, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo activity.
He told the BBC about his love of vinyl and his busy schedule and explained how comedian Matt Berry came to open his shows.
What does vinyl mean to you?
I grew up right in the end of the vinyl era, and I remember then I was looking forward to the CD, because vinyl was so annoying.
You were buying a record, you were going home with him, he had a scratch on him, and you had to bring him back.
I love CDs, and for some types of music, like classical music, they're better than vinyl.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing left that you really value.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice painting hanging in your living room.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you let yourself get sucked into the lyrics and overwhelmed by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but there's no way it could be if kids too young to remember vinyls like that kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl you particularly care about?
I admit I got rid of all the vinyls in the '90s.
All the vinyls I have are bought again.
I started from the idea of redoing the collection I had when I was 15, but I crossed that line.
The first record I convinced my parents to buy me was Out of the Blue from Electric Light Orchestra.
If I still had the original, it would have sentimental value, but unfortunately, it's somewhere in a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a gateway to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transience vinyl compilation?
This was originally conceived as an idea for record store day, but we missed the opportunity.
My label had suggested that I collect some of my shorter and more accessible songs.
I came to be slightly obsessed with the idea of doing something like "introduction into Steven Wilson's music," and I really wanted the project to be launched on vinyl alone.
Whoever buys vinyl also receives a downloaded high-resolution variant.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in its true light?
No, because although I am focusing on longer music, there is one thing that I have always cherished above all else: the melodic part.
There is much progressive rock that focuses on technical complexity rather than the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the test of time because they always stressed the melodic side and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for the Albert Hall shows?
I don't want to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different every one of the nights.
In the first, there will be a version of the Hand show. It was. which we had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night will be more of a foray into my history, which is more focused on the fans who have been watching me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show on the second night?
And me and the rest of the tour team are big fans of [Channel 4 comedy series] Toast of London, to the point where we quote it all the time.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music, so I bought him the album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our mutual love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to play at the Royal Albert Hall.
It seems to me I'm extremely lucky to have him open.
You remixed albums by bands like XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does that affect your own music?
I am not consciously inspired by this, but inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they remain in your mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was undoubtedly the most progressive old school album I've ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that we had remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all last year.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because I had worked at Tears for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the busiest progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can phase out the word progressively.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in the music world today, and I'm not saying this with pride, because please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an incredibly powerful work ethic.
If I don't do anything all day, I start feeling guilty.
That's why working on remixes was a gift, because it means I don't always have to do just my music.
The music industry is a tough place to make a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend that to anyone as a profession.
I work daily and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lazy, I don't think I would have survived.
Transience will be launched in the UK on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will perform at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his 2015-2016 European tour.
A new contract brings jobs back to Skytrans
The new Skytrans rehired some of the airline staff who had lost their jobs when the old Skytrans went bankrupt.
Skytrans, the restored company in northern Queensland, awarded a $25 million contract to transport the employees of the natural gas company QGC, which meant that 18 crew members had their job back.
Skytrans, owned by the Wild family, became very active in January after the Newman government rewarded subsidised routes that formed much of the airline's business.
Bankruptcy caused several communities to face potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, a federal-liberal MP for Northern Queensland, was the voice of criticism of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, CEO of Skytrans, said the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We managed to rehir 18 full-time Skytrans personnel as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for QGC customers.
In just five months, we have increased by 100% labour force, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims to extend Skytrans's flight operations from its headquarters in Cairns, which serves Cape York and Torres Strait, and to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 return flights a week for QGC personnel and for Brisbane entrepreneurs to locations in Chinchilla and Taroom, in its 36-seat Dash-8 aircraft, starting on Monday, 26 October.
Tony Nunan, CEO of QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following a tender procedure.
"We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains its high quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer gets the advice to make a larger milk supply to avoid missing votes in the House
Looks like there'll be more women in the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be invested on Monday and there are strong signals that more women will occupy portfolios.
One of the government's rising stars, Kelly O'Dwyer, was advised to make a larger supply of milk for her newborn in order to avoid breast-feeding interfering with her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the head of government discipline, Scott Buchholz, who subsequently consulted his Labour counterpart to find out what is the best approach for a breast-feeding MP, according to the ordinances in force.
Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer and her daughter Olivia.
According to the ordinances in force - the set of rules governing the conduct of parliamentarians in the Chamber - breastfeeding mothers get a voting power in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
However, Whip did not know about this exoneration until he had consulted opposition discipline chief Chris Hayes on the matter.
Things rushed on two occasions when O'Dwyer could not attend a divisional meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to give a speech because he had just begun breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the parliamentarywoman had thought of making a larger milk supply instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, Queensland MP, is the government's discipline officer.
The two later resolved their dispute.
Both refused to comment when they were contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources of Buchholz and O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media that the representative of Higgins was angry when he was told to make a larger supply of milk instead of breast-feeding his daughter Olivia, born in May.
This is revealed just as new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working on the composition of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, a liberal national parliament member of Queensland, was promoted to disciplinary officer by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of his attempt at a no-confidence motion in February this year.
O'Dwyer, with Amanda Rishworth of the Labour Party and her son Percy, is one of the three mothers in Parliament.
The former disciplinary officer, Phillip Ruddock, was removed just days after Abbott had faced a no-confidence motion to remove him from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed deputy discipline officer.
Nickolic had recently kept the front page of the newspapers, after it had been discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to quit challenging Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after the birth of her daughter, Olivia, in May.
It is one of the three parliamentary members who became mothers this year.
Labour party spokesman Catherine King said Wednesday that the voting power for nursing mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now she's [seven]," she tweeted.
The disciplinary officer should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted to the cabinet late last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said Wednesday he wants more women in his cabinet.
"No one wants to see more women in power, influence, in Parliament, in ministries, throughout the country than I do," the prime minister told reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included only one woman in his first cabinet and, after pressure to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the December reshuffle.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, editor of BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull might have on Australia's business sector.
On Tuesday, lobbying groups in the business sector did not know how to show more enthusiasm when Malcolm Turnbull took over as prime minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them would have wanted to see had been abandoned under the leadership of Tony Abbott.
Or he had simply reached a negotiated suspension because of Abbott's "crash-or-break-through" political style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke in unison about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy the public interest, reach political agreement and do things well.
So what exactly do the country's biggest companies and their representatives expect from our new prime minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity.
Turnbull himself set as a starting target the free trade agreement with China.
In his first speech announcing that challenge in the media, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (Chafta) was the focus of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticised "the revolting outbursts of economic chauvinism" by the Labour Party on that issue and expressed concern over the racist temptation of critics.
"In the context of ChAFTA, the winners are, numerically, much more than the losers," he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes he will win this debate.
Don Argus, legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, supported among others by the Australian Business Council (which represents the 100 largest companies in the country) and James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and this will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity and negotiate with the entire Senate.
Small Business Minister Bruce Billson backs the Harper Review recommendations.
This could lead from the start to certain divergences with the business environment.
The impact assessment applies to large mergers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer from a lack of competition.
It is called "effect assessment" because it takes into account not only the company's actions and intentions, but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this assessment is drawn up is extremely important for the outcome.
Harper's analysis of competition law recommends a change in the assessment of effects, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to push smaller operators off the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Business Council and the major retailers.
Turnbull now suggests that he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he will do next.
The CAA jumped as burned to say that if Turnbull follows the recommendations of the Harper analysis, consumers will have to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that it is the whole business environment that has advised the new prime minister to have greater respect for cabinet trials, which Turnbull seems to do by letting Bruce Billson, the minister for small businesses (who is on Harper's side of recommendations) support his arguments to his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers have been tracking women between the ages of sixty and eighty.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and olive oil have reduced their "significant" probability of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard questions the multiplication board
Terrence Howard thinks I completely misunderstood arithmetic.
Empire's villain told Rolling Stone magazine he didn't think one or one was equal to one.
"How can it be equal to one?" he said.
If one times one makes one, it means that two have no value, since one times itself has no effect.
One times one makes two, because the square root of four is two -- so what is the square root of two?
There should be one, but we're told it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's teachers disagreed with his theory, so he dropped out of the Pratt Institute, where he was studying chemical engineering.
"I mean you can't close your eyes when inside you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found the term "Terryology" for his parallel approach to mathematics.
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassembling scissors, wire, magnets and plastic sheets to illustrate his theory "one times one" and other similar theories.
He told the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, were spending up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The editor Rolling Stone described Howard's creations as "infinitely more complex, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional bricks linked to each other by copper wire or by magnets.
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the US patent 20150079872 A1 ("Systems and Methods for Improved Building Brick Applications").
Also, the actor in "Following an Idol" also says that Pythagoras Einstein and Tesla would "go crazy" if they saw Terryology.
"You know," he says, "I've wondered since I was three or four years old why is a bubble taking shape round?"
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hopes to change the whole course of education.
"This will be the last century in which our children will learn that one or one do one," he said.
They will no longer have to grow up in ignorance.
In twenty years from now, they'll know that one times one makes two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
True universal mathematics.
We'll check it out in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
During "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" on Tuesday, Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star performed a little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, performing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying his vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" with Aguilera's voice.
Fallon, in turn, did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
They also performed, in turn, versions of "I Can't Feel My Face" from The Weenand.
This week, Grande's name kept coming up in the press.
On the same day, he had been on "Good Morning America", where he opened the show with the incident of licking the doughnut.
Taco Bell hopes "Cantina" restaurants where wine will be served will become points of urban interest
Would you like to spend an elegant evening in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On 22 September, the Mexican-style fast food chain will open a new location in the Wicker Park area in Chicago, offering a tapas menu of appetizers, a fresco painted by a local artist and even alcoholic beverages.
It is the first testing location of the chain's "Taco Bell Cantina" restaurants, which address young people, concentrated in increasing numbers in city centres.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6,000 restaurants in the United States, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap, fast-prepared food, such as Doritos Locos Taco, which is extremely popular.
With an average $7 Taco Bell bill, the company used drive-through service and fast service to attract the number of customers needed to make a profit.
However, Taco Bell states that in order to address the new generation that "seeks more central urban environments where to live, work and have fun", test sites must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
So you can do a drive-through, you need land.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"You can't afford it," told USA TODAY Neil Borkan, the franchised Taco Bell who will operate the Chicago location.
At the Chicago location, the new menu will be prepared alongside traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where "you can literally see the food" before it is ready, said for Associated Press Meredith Sandland, responsible for development at Taco Bell.
Wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages will also be served at the new location, following the recent example of many of the Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy-five Starbucks offers “evening” menus that include beer, wine and snacks.
A thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic beverages.
The company claimed that another Taco Bell Cantina location would open in San Francisco near AT&T Park this month, replacing the drive-through service and the parking lot with an inner courtyard and a sales window.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the fast food chain wants to attract customers other than those looking for fast food late at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality culinary line in 2012, when it opened Cantina and more expensive burritos to compete with Chipotle, the project being supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new preparations.
If successful, Cantina restaurants will represent another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said that by 2022, he plans to open 2000 restaurants in the US.
As Sandland told the AP, "a few hundred" of them would be of the Cantina type.
They set the phones on fire in the middle of the night: Elton John woos Putin
Russian President Vladimir Putin contacted Elton John on Monday night, just days after the British artist publicly said he wanted to meet the Russian politician to discuss antigay legislation in Russia together.
The declared British singer, homosexual, tried unsuccessfully to get a meeting with Putin while in Russia in November 2014, one year after defying protests in this country and performing two concerts in 2013, during a turbulent period in the history of this state, after the adoption of controversial laws, which prohibit "gay propaganda" among minors.
In 2014, in Saint Petersburg, the British artist criticised these laws and made the following statement to fans: "Although I am gay, I always felt welcome here in Russia".
If I wasn't honest about who I am, I wouldn't be able to write these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express life.
If we start punishing people for this, then the world will lose its humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist revealed that he wanted to meet with Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information on the telephone discussion between the two personalities.
The rooster "singed" everything in the ANRP file
Businessman Dorin Cocos tries to save himself from a stinging conviction, "singing" also in front of the judges and detailing how he shared millions of euros to former members of the ANRP Commission.
Hearing yesterday at the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the file in which he is tried with his son Alin Cocos, by the former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and by former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Compensations within ANRP, Dorin Cocos was struck by the lightning of sincerity.
He admitted all the accusations and told the judges in detail how he helped businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of compensations from ANRP, instead demanding that he be tried more quickly and that his collaboration be taken into account.
Thus, Cocos showed that he knew Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he became friends with him after several real estate businesses.
He noted that Sergiu Diacomatu met in 2010, and he told him he was working at ANRP.
Later we found out that Diacomatu (Diacomatu, n.r.) is vice president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at ANRP, we asked him to help us.
I promised him money, 2.5 million euros, money I told him I'd give him in more trenches.
I also promised him political support to stay in office.
"Diacomatu told me then that he was helping me, but that he needed support," Dorin Cocos showed in the courtroom.
He also said that, later, through an acquaintance, he came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then head of the Central Commission for Compensation, to whom he promised 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, I also gave him EUR 5 million.
To the Liliuta Dumitrean a million euros, to Dragos Bogdan I gave 800,000 euros.
I'm stating that all this money I was giving him in the trenches to make sure the file was resolved.
"That's all I told them: to solve the file, to make amends," the Cocos said.
Asked why he came to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
I received, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only had 1.2 million euros left.
In 2013 I also met Alina Bica.
"I never talked to this money or land," the Cocos showed.
He also showed that "it was notorious that at ANRP all the members were getting along before the meeting".
I wasn't nervous that they wouldn't give the positive vote.
All functions were political in ANRP, but I personally did not help Diacomatu politically.
"I told him I was only helping him politically to reassure him," Cocos concluded his statement.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was at the DNA yesterday for only five minutes, while he filed new documents in the file "Turceni-Rovinari".
Victor Ponta fled to the DNA with a document from the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the prosecutor of the case will receive him for a discussion on the file in which he is investigated for forgery in documents under private signature, complicity in tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went on his own initiative to the DNA, although the documents he had could be sent through the lawyer.
It wasn't meant to be, since the D.A. didn't have time, the prime minister leaving after five minutes, during which time he left several documents at the register.
I wanted to file the decision of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, which explains what happens with the service contracts.
I say we did some work, the prosecutor says we didn't, the European Court of Justice told us to go about our business together, because as long as the taxes were paid, that's fine.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, sure, for all the countries of the European Union, we do not have a case here," Prime Minister Victor Ponta said at the DNA exit.
Ponta also said that, from his point of view, the decision of the European Court should apply if we are EU members.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read the European Court's decision and call him back to the hearings, but to give him an answer to his demands, including disparating the file.
Iohannis enjoys his warrant without a TV.
In Romania nowadays, there is no legal provision for you to watch TV.
And you don't even own a machine like that, since you pay your TV bill with your energy bill.
But if you're the head of state, things change radically.
Because, basically, it is understood that in the job description of the President of Romania it is also registered when connecting to everyday realities.
President Iohannis sinks daily in total silence in his office at Cotroceni
Only, to the stupor of even his closest men at the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Iohannis refuses to have television in the presidential office.
And after not watching TV - no program, not even the German stations RTL or Pro Sieben -, the president does not listen to radio stations or read newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive the "negative monitoring" which, for example, its predecessor asked for as a priority.
Instead, Iohannis is happy to receive only the report of the news that puts him in a positive light.
And besides this informational self-isolation, in which the only breach is access to facebook, much more serious is the blockage to which, through its passivity, the chief of state pushes the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, although it's been such a long time since his installation, Iohannis has not yet signed the loyalty statements of more than half of the employees of the Presidential Administration.
Which is becoming an increasingly serious problem, both from a human and a legal point of view.
Peace and quiet
It is already clear to those in the presidential entourage that no one and nothing can damage the feng shui in the chief of state's office.
Where there is peace and quiet.
That's right, just after nine o'clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when the former adile of Sibiu requires the presence of the officials.
A habit he probably didn't get out of when he was running the Cibin City Hall.
And about the fact that Iohannis doesn't want TV in his office, countless legends have already been born, already being people from the Cotroceni Palace who have come to incline towards the possibility that the President would thus try to avoid his monitoring.
Especially since he doesn't have a radio.
Only, at this rate, you are going to meditate as soon as in the dark, because lighting devices can also hide the audio-video recording technique.
Just for the best
Also, another strange thing from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the chief of state only of the "pzoitive monitoring" of the President's activity.
I mean, if there's any news of good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the head of state will receive its content.
If you don't, don't!
Even more interesting is that it was banned from "negative monitoring" when, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a result of late-night TV shows in which he was criticized, but he asked for negative news every morning, with priority.
That doesn't necessarily mean that it helped him, but, that word, that gesture counts!
And at least he can't ever have the excuse that he wasn't well informed from alternative sources.
Not outside, not confirmed.
Now, finally, the mystery of why Klaus Iohannis doesn't want to watch TV.
Until then, however, it would be more important to resolve, no matter what formula, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees from the Presidential Administration.
Who, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the chief of state in office and who must also bear his signature.
Only, since December until now, Klaus Iohannis has not signed up for confirmation of even half of these statements, although this was supposed to happen in 30 days at most.
So hundreds of employees, representing over half of the staff at the Cotroceni Palace, have an uncertain situation now.
Because legally speaking, if the head of state doesn't sign their statement personally, they should be thrown out.
Only they all didn't get a negative opinion!
So, at some point, the inspectors of the Court of Accounts can come at any time, who will find that, for over half a year, so many hundreds of people have received their salaries at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
Until the president decides whether to fire them or confirm them in posts, the decision is strictly his.
Authorities said a teenager was planning an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S.
A teenager's ISIS-inspired plan to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the US was "aspirational" rather than operational, a police source for Fox News confirmed on Tuesday.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August, when law enforcement foiled the plan.
The plan is the same as Texas Representative Mike McCaul, the president of Homeland Security, said during an interview Sunday, a source for Fox News.
"We are monitoring very carefully the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States of America," McCaul said at ABC's "This Week".
Pope Francis was not mentioned as the specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
of joint information by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security on 14 August, in which it was claimed that the adolescent was planning to use multiple attackers, firearms and explosives, targeting "a foreign dignitary during a high-level event".
The report states that the minor has radicalised through social networks.
It is possible that the adolescent suffers from a mental illness, a source of the law enforcement authority for Fox News said, but without giving specific details about the young man's illness.
Also, on Sunday, McCaul acknowledged the potential for an attack by a so-called "lonely wolf" across the nation and noted that he was informed by the Secret Service of a "strictly secret location" for the Pope's visit.
But as the date gets closer, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.

The medieval skeleton discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, experts say
Irish archaeologists have revealed amazing details of the strange skeleton dating back to medieval times, found at the root of a 215 - year - old tree.
The beech of Colloney, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, bringing out the gruesome sight of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish Service of National Monuments brought experts from Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to excavate and analyze the remains, thus discovering a gruesome story.
"He was violently killed," Marion Dowd, director of Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, told FoxNews.com.
In his upper chest, he has stab wounds, and he has one of these marks in his left hand, which suggests he was trying to defend himself.
The skeleton belongs to a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We cannot know whether he was killed in battle or in a personal dispute," Dowd says, noting that the body was buried after the Christian ritual, with its head pointing west.
"It was probably buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd told FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents showing that there was a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect of discovery: the height of the young man.
"He was 5'4", says Dowd.
For early medieval society, that means quite a lot.
Federal government spends 1.5 million dollars to study what babies think about food
The National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent nearly $1.5 million studying what young children think about food.
The project, called "The way babies and small children perceive food" is carried out by the University of Chicago and, so far, has determined that children are not likely to eat foods licked by other people or that other people have sneezed on.
According to the project financier, "adequate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have nutritionally healthy diets.
There is evidence to suggest that the first dietary models of babies and young children have lasting consequences for the health of life.
The premise for this study is that research on how babies view food is missing.
“Despite the complexity and significance of food selection, psychologists for child development have devoted surprisingly little attention to studying how babies and young children perceive, learn and understand food,” said the financier.
The current proposal applies cognitive development methods to test social influences on the choice and consumption of food in babies and young children.
Researchers say babies have "limited knowledge of food".
Children between the ages of three and six "know more about food than babies and young children", but are "extremely picky consumers".
An actress who played in "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played in the television series "Star Trek: Voyager" was arrested in East Tennessee, accused of exposing herself to children.
Several media outlets report that actress Jennifer Ann Lien, 41, who played Kes in the television series, is charged with two indecent exposure offences involving children under the age of 13, according to the arrest report.
Officers of the Sheriff's Office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant on September 3rd, to Lien's home in Harriman, where they say they found her naked under a blanket on the couch.
Officers said Lien refused their requests to dress.
Harriman Police Chief Randy Heidle says Lien has been charged with several counts, including aggravated bodily harm, following the April incident that Lien entered a police car with his own car.
You still don't know if he has a lawyer.
Police identified the murder victim found in Epping Forest
A man whose decomposing corpse was discovered in a tourist forest has been identified.
On 9 September, 53-year-old Hidir Aksakal was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping Forest, northeast of London.
The Turkish man lived in Margate, Kent, and had close ties to the Green Lanes area in Haringey, north of London.
He was last seen in Green Lanes on Monday morning, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved that he was murdered, and the detectives say his body had probably been in the Epping Forest for several weeks.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo of the Metropolitan Police said: "Mr Aksakal was well known locally as the Cetin Boxer and we hope to learn from the Green Lanes community information to help us with the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a crowded and popular tourist place, where there is a cafe and a lake for boating.
It's also surrounded by streets with heavy traffic.
We're asking everyone who's been in the area for the past few weeks and maybe they've noticed any unusual activity or suspicious activity, to come and talk to us.
Super chief: six women juggling between maternity and work
Unlike any other country in the world, except Papua New Guinea, there is no centralised policy on paid maternity leave in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo's CEO, Marissa Mayer, announced that she was pregnant with twins, but was planning to take a very short maternity leave and "work during" her free time, the 40-year-old woman was widely criticized for encouraging a culture waiting for a superwoman or nothing.
But is Mayer, herself a symbol of the top woman, to blame for unrealistic expectations?
How are other women's leaders doing?
Seema Patel, lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Labour Standards Office, had just obtained a government job in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss stunned her with unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," her boss said.
But if you're going to start a family in the future, start packing up your vacation now.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't even get a day's maternity leave paid as part of her employment contract.
At the time, Patel was single and very focused on her career, and the family was the last thing on her mind.
But she took the advice of her boss.
She avoided using her sick days for four years, so when she became pregnant with her first child two years ago, she had collected three months of paid leave.
Six months ago, when Patel gave birth to his second child, he could no longer apply the same strategy.
The four months of leave he took were entirely unpaid.
Patel says she didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but she has a problem with the structure of work.
"I find it very discouraging for anyone who tries to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your country does not place any value on becoming a parent.
Karen Choi, vice president of the Capital Group asset management firm, says that any female employee who is a mother should be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes juggling between motherhood and work as "a constant struggle".
The secret not to sink is to have "an incredible family with you" and a nanny and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that you won't be the best at ("not everyone can be Martha in interior design") and simply go through with it.
Choi says he took a growing maternity leave for each child, starting at two and a half months for the first and ending six months for the last.
That makes her an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child is sick, he has a fever, he vomits, and you stay up all night to take care of him, and you know the next morning you have to take your other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it gets very complicated," she says.
But her company claimed it and noted that her investment portfolio's performance had nothing to do with it.
When she entered the finance industry after university, about 20 of her college colleagues had chosen the same path, she says.
Today, about 90% of them gave up.
Women who quit their jobs, then start again don't have the same chances at top paid positions, she says.
It is difficult to stay: “In the short term it is a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen.”
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me move forward is that I want to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates 48-year-old scientist and teacher Kelly Posner.
Children know that their mother literally helps save lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Center for Suicide Risk Assessment at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "great goal" in terms of their careers and fulfill it.
It's very important that women think they can have a vision.
Most people can't afford to believe that," she says.
She once gave a presentation to 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a webinar, when she was eight months pregnant.
It has also helped technology, she says, because she can stop the car and answer the phone after picking up her children or answering an e-mail on the way.
Juggling between maternity and a demanding career has been helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. The ability to complete things even when it seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33, CEO of Wisconsin Jobs Now and mother of two, says that making maternity and career work together only through private aid networks, such as nannies, is wrong.
"You shouldn't get lucky or win the lottery to be successful," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - noting very low wages, poor health care and the lack of paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't care about each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of the mothers who just gave birth.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while attending law school, gave birth to her child while receiving a scholarship.
With a husband and child relying on scholarship healthcare, the job leader was able to take a maternity leave of only two weeks, then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashion stylist and mother of two children, says that fewer and fewer women will abandon their profession if they receive more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining mutually agreed programs and accepting that effective work does not mean staying late.
At the forefront of logistical constraints, Mosko says, is the additional pressure to act in an area where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of lack of taste ("mommy clothes" is one of the worst insults).
"Image is part of our job - get up or pull you down," she explains.
Mosko's "Permanent Negotiation" for its multiple roles to function harmoniously means to maintain its chic appearance and a beautiful bag in the hand, but sometimes another toy or two falls.
If he remembers that men are fathers too, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men for not being good fathers to the extent they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and executive director of the New York housing authority, who handles the homes of over 400,000 New Yorkers and employs more than 11,000 people, says maternity and career is not talking about "balance".
The notion of balance is a little inappropriate.
It looks more like a rocking chair," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom is only three months old, she just took a seven-week maternity leave after giving birth this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to take paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible schedule, which meant leaving early or late, so that she could breast-feed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning that ends at 06:00 ("lower than therapy") still breast-feeds.
At work, he tried to create a "friendly environment for parents" where delay due to a child is allowed, and the reply to emails does not necessarily need to be sent from the office.
"The concept of family has changed and changed a lot," Olatoye says.
"The family is very different from what it was 25 or even 10 years ago."
It's the job that needs to adapt.
Russian humorists say they tricked Elton John into a call from Putin
For cynics it seemed too good to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, to Sir Elton John, singer and advocate for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant Instagram post in which he thanked the Russian leader for addressing the problem, it immediately became clear that whoever called him on Monday night had certainly not been Putin.
The Kremlin had already stated that he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian humorists admitted that they, not the president, had been foreign voices at the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was unlikely that Putin would want to meet with him or call him, or at least not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov pretended to be President Dmitri Peskov's spokesman.
"But it seems that Elton John was really waiting for this call, so he immediately thought that it was really a conversation with the righteous people we were posing," he told the Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.
He said, "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day."
This day and this conversation have been the most wonderful and delightful of my life.
As to complete John's embarrassing situation, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation on a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives didn't give statements about the hoax speculation.
At the bottom of the story are the comments the singer made on the weekend, in which he criticised Putin for his "ridical" attitude towards homosexuals while he was campaigning for LGBT rights in Kiev, criticising in particular a Russian law adopted in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
"I would like to meet [Putin], to talk," John told the BBC, saying that although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it was worth a try.
Then, on Monday evening, the singer aroused the mistrust of some observers when he published a message on a social network, saying Putin responded to his critics by taking the phone and calling him.
He said he "was looking forward to meeting [the president] face-to-face to discuss the equality of the LGBT in Russia".
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one at the other end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for their prank calls to many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks good English, played the role of Peskov and claimed to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told journalists Tuesday that Putin would be "ready to meet Elton John and answer all his questions", but that there was no such request from the singer in the Kremlin.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the Instagram post, he added, "especially because it is not written entirely in correct English".
We do not believe that Sir Elton John would also have written grammar mistakes.
Even before the Russian duet declared its farce publicly, local media already suspected that John had been the victim of a joke.
Some online users have identified Krasnov as guilty, known for pranking politicians with phones that they record and post on his YouTube channel as Vovan222.
The phone calls to public figures, then the publication of the recordings, have become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is regarded by many as the initiator of the genre, has developed his talent for pranking Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television, imitating Anton Gerashchenko, direct adviser to Interior Minister Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Gerashchenko so well that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoiski, for more than six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to massive street protests after reports of massive fraud.
Acting as Arkady Dvorkovich, then president Dmitry Medvedev's adviser, convinced election commission chairman Vladimir Churov that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, his victims included former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev, Kiev's mayor and boxing champion Vitali Klitschko and Russian sports minister Vitali Mutko, whom he tricked into apologizing for the drunken behavior of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko, posing as the son of the dismissed Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovici.
He was so convincing that the person at the other end, whose voice looked like Lukashenko's, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he wanted to talk to Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
Legislator Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the law on "propaganda," told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with a "subject so irrelevant" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain Russia's position.
The Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online survey for readers, in which 39% of respondents thought Putin and John should meet, and 22% thought such a meeting would harm Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people a year die prematurely from external air pollution, more than from malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is burning wood and coal for home heating and cooking, but research reveals that agricultural emissions from Europe and the US are just as alarming as the main cause of these deaths.
The report warns that unless action is taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projections should sound an alarm for public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, environmental health expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by air rain are caused by tiny particles that can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
They cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million deaths annually, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory disease.
The research did not include the effects of indoor air pollution, for example from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause 3.4 million more deaths per year.
The new study, published in the newspaper Nature, was the first to highlight various sources of external air pollution and estimated the number of premature deaths they cause, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel plants and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computer model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on the various populations, including new information on how pollution affects the inhabitants of China and India.
One third of all premature deaths were the result of using smoke-extinguishing fuels, such as wood and coal, for heating homes or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of which are recognised dangers.
Consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of India's 645 000 annual deaths and one third of China's 1.4 million annual deaths.
However, research has found that ammonia agricultural emissions have had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the Max Planck Chemical Institute in Germany, which led the research.
One fifth of all deaths are caused by these emissions, mainly from cattle, birds and pigs and the excess use of fertilisers.
Ammonia reacts with exhaust gases from traffic and industry and produces tiny particles, the main cause of death due to air pollution in the eastern US, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," Lelieveld says.
Throughout the UK, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing a fifth of the dead, despite measures against polluting vehicles.
This has caused only 5% of deaths worldwide, but the figure could increase as more and more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by power plants, especially coal-operated ones, has been significant globally, causing one in seven deaths.
In the US, it is the main single factor, causing one third of the 55 000 deaths annually, compared to 16% in the UK.
Natural air pollution, especially in arid and dusty regions, has caused almost a fifth of the global deaths caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, responsible for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The overlap between the high level of pollution and the large number of inhabitants speaks out on public health, but there is little known about the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at global level.
All particles are now believed to be equally toxic.
But if those caused by the combustion of fuels are more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths attributable to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, Jerrett says "the discovery is very valuable ... because agriculture was not generally seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and because it suggests that much more attention should be paid to agricultural sources, both from scientists and political leaders".
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmospheric specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: "The study really highlights the need for air quality control to avoid these deaths, especially in highly populated areas of Asia".
A statement by Victor Ponta strains more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the Romanian prime minister speaks of attitudes that remind Nazism
Relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement on the construction of a fence on the border with Romania, after the one on the Serbian border, experienced a new depreciation following statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused Budapest authorities on Monday of treating refugees "with bat and insert".
Hungarian diplomacy reacted harshly to "extremely and lying" allegations, but Victor Ponta also did not go any lower and accused government officials in the neighbouring country of being "a disgrace" to Europe.
It should be noted that this is not the first time that Ponta tries to strain Roman-Hungarian relations through statements made in delicate or electoral moments.
It all started from a statement made by Victor Ponta on Monday, in which he tried to argue that Romania could not receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem is our logistical ability to treat those people like people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with bats and inserts.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu put himself at the forefront of an ugly and horrible feeling that existed in all societies, namely a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's up to us to solve the problem.
"We will treat those people like ourselves," the Truth quoted Victor Ponta as saying on Monday.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta meant when he spoke about the introduction of refugees, but the Czech Republic was recently at the heart of criticism after writing numbers on the hands of migrants on several trains, in a gesture that reminded of the procedure used by the Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners in concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, took over by Magyaridok.hu, probably the internal political crises that rocked Victor Ponta's position are causing him to make statements "extremely and lying".
The Romanian business officer from Budapest was summoned to provide explanations, informs Mediafax, quoting MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inadequate statements about how Hungary manages the immigrant crisis," the Hungarian Foreign Ministry said.
Levente Magyar, Secretary of State for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in Hungarian MAE, expressed the "surprise" about Victor Ponta's "constant attempts to save his controversial moral position through anti-Hungarian lies", points out diplomacy in Budapest.
"I do not want to respond to the challenges of some Hungarian government representatives - but read the account below and you will understand the indignation that I feel, as a European man and citizen, towards the mentalities and attitudes that Europe saw only in the 1930s-40!!", Ponta wrote on his Facebook account.
He claims that, like other European policies, he has the duty to attract attention and sanction "the constant behaviour of the highest-level government officials in Hungary" who are "a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union" through "anti-Semitic attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"The barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees flee!" Ponta accused, saying that he believes in "solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values", and "what we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction precisely with these objectives and values!".
During the evening, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main topic was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if the Hungarian military started and shot or killed some children or women, in a speech in which he made several references to Nazism.
The dispute was also attended by UDMR President Kelemen Hunor, who felt that the Romanian authorities should not have a "sentimental approach" to Hungary's intention to build a fence on the border.
The UDMR leader said that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or against Romanian citizens, showing that the fence might even help our country not to become an intense route transited by migrants who want to reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to point out, to say, that we don't have to get hysterical, to take this whole thing as something against Romania, and we don't have to use it to aggravate the not-so-good relations between the two governments anyway, because that's not the case.
I think every sentimental, visceral approach is not right.
"We need to see the rational part, see why we got here and we need to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, against the Romanian citizens and does not hinder free movement between the two states within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The West ignored Russia's offer in 2012 to remove Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia proposed more than three years ago the removal of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad as part of a peace agreement, according to a high official involved at the time in negotiations with closed doors between western countries and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
Former President of Finland and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari said Western powers did not take advantage of the then proposal.
From 2012 to the present, tens of thousands of people have died and millions have had to flee the country, giving rise to the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held talks with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, United Kingdom, France, Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
He also said that during the talks, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin offered a plan including among other things Assad's proposal to give up power at some point after the beginning of peace talks between the regime and the opposition.
He proposed three things:
One - we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we must initiate a dialogue between Assad and the opposition immediately.
"Three - we must seek an elegant way for Assad to withdraw," Ahtisaari said, narrating the Russian ambassador's position.
But he also said Ahtisaari, the United States, Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator would fall, they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a missed opportunity in 2012," the former President of Finland continued.
Russia officially supported Bashar al-Assad strongly over the four and a half years of war, insisting that his removal could not be a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad believes that Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow recently began sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilise Assad's regime and confront Islamic State extremists.
Antena 3's live Internet program will be available for a fee
Antenna 3 informed its viewers on Tuesday that from 1 November its live program could be viewed online for a fee, based on a monthly subscription.
In a "letter to the viewers", the news station of the Intact trust stated that "we do this with a close heart, wishing that you would stay with us at this new stage, imposed by market conditions".
According to the same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who are watching us online", television promising that watching will be of very good quality.
Antenna 3 claims that "all these live broadcasts from the country and abroad, campaigns, daily news have been and are possible through a constant, assumed financial effort that has entailed a permanent refurbishment and focus on quality".
We managed to support ourselves, given that online and offline distributors have contributed nothing to the content offered.
The announcement comes when the news television program is accessible on subscription and online platform Antena Play, where, by the way, the recordings of the Antene broadcasts have been accessible most often exclusively.
Reports show that populations of animals and marine plants have halved over the past 40 years
The scale of the crisis faced by marine animals and plants is documented in detail in a study that states that marine species worldwide, including those essential to the safety of human food, are in a catastrophic decline.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions across the global ocean ecosystem combine and create a whirlwind of difficulties for almost all marine life, says the WWF's "Live Blue Planet" report.
Coral reefs are at serious risk of decline (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and sea grass, on which many other species depend, have experienced a significant decline, while entire fish populations of commercial value, such as mackerel and tuna, have plummeted by three quarters compared to the 1970s, the report says.
Many coral reefs, usually described as rainforests of the oceans due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by the middle of this century if ocean acidity continues to worsen, as a result of increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere, causing a directly proportional increase in carbonic acid levels in the sea.
"Healthy seas are a source of extraordinary beauty and natural wonder, and they are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, chief marine policy adviser at WWF-UK, who contributed to the report.
"By overfishing, which damages coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we sow the seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of published scientific literature, as well as the Living Planet Index, a database maintained by the London Zoological Society, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It researched a wide variety of marine species, from fish, sea turtles and sea cucumbers - a worm-like animal with rough skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that algae areas decreased by around 30% in the last century, while total mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp and other forms of aquaculture.
Over a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their shoals.
It takes profound changes to ensure an abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, CEO of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have occurred in species fished for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the family Scrombidae - mackerel, tuna and sardines - fell by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without showing any signs of recovery, the report says.
We are in a fishing race that could end up depriving people of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
Overfishing, destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities, which rely on the sea, will be hit the fastest and most powerful," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and undermine our struggle to eradicate poverty and malnutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, science director of the ZL, said: "These alarming figures prove how quickly people change the plants and animals in the oceans and represent a clear warning about the problems we might face as a result."
Seagrass: large-scale submarines that catch mineral-rich sediments and stabilize the seabed.
Over the last century, the surface area decreased by 30%.
Mangroves: their existence is known in 123 countries, with nearly half of the total area representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most biologically productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of all marine species live in or near coral reefs, but three quarters of them are currently under threat and many may disappear over the course of this century if ocean acidity continues to worsen.
Habits in the deep: very little is known about the deeper areas of the ocean, but the decline in the amount of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by global marine changes.
Steven Gerrard denies allegations of racism brought to him by his former Liverpool teammate, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his working autobiography "My Story" ("My Story"), serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalese player by saying that "he is not really interested in football" and that he is the fellow he liked "the least" during his 17 years at the club.
In response, Diouf would have replied to Gerrard on Senegalese Radio Groupe Futures Medias, with translated quotes attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked black people".
Gerrard's lawyers denied any allegations of racism against him.
In his latest book, Gerrard, who had previously made public his poor opinion of Diouf, criticised his former colleague's attitude and professionalism.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his wasted seasons in Liverpool as an example of how things can go wrong," he writes.
"It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and that he doesn't care about Liverpool at all," he continued.
For example, the way he spat out a huge, viscous phlegm in a Celtic fan in a Parkhead Uefa Cup match in March 2003 is evidence of his contemptuous and rancid behavior.
Diouf proved to be a controversial figure in all his time on Anfield, his most notorious night being the one on Celtic Park.
The Senegalese advance was questioned by the police after the spit episode and fined the value of his two-week salary at the club, with £60,000 being donated to a humanitarian organisation of Celtic's choice.
In his earlier autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard wrote.
I felt that he wasn't exactly willing to make all the effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays for the Malaysian club Sabah, also publicly criticized Gerrard and attacked Gerrard's old friend and teammate, Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf named Gerrard "selfish" and claimed that no one on Anfield liked the player who led the team to the Champions League victory in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying Gerrard is "jealous".
He said: “Gerrard is simply jealous of me.
He didn't get the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came up with the status of chief, and he lives there.
I am respected in the world of football, the greatest football experts have placed me among the top seven players in the World Championship and among the top 100 players of the century.
Many great players do not have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I go in other countries, I am revered, while Gerrard is booed every time he leaves his hometown of Liverpool.
From hero to professional dancer: Alek Skarlatos' fast road to Dancing With the Stars
This season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Skarlatos does not just play the hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic type, equally discreet and modern, say the producers.
"Read many categories and always look for the most popular of the moment," said Deena Katz, the executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find an agent after this.
He's charming.
He's got something special.
Before he was a contestant at the famous show - but only a few weeks before - Skarlatos arrived in the international press after taking a stand in the face of great danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized an armed man with an AK-47 on a train full of passengers from Amsterdam to Paris.
Those three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
After that, Skarlatos, 22, sentinel to the National Army, who grew up nearby Sacramento, received a call from President Obama, a Twitter message from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although he may have anticipated some local appreciations - on Friday in Sacramento, there was a parade in honor of the young man - he did not expect so many positive reactions or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"Not in a million years would I have thought that I would get this offer," Skarlatos confessed on Saturday, during a break from the dance rehearsals with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy to me.
Even though before Monday night's performance he admitted to being "lightly excited", he handled himself as a professional at his first foxtrot, achieving scores that almost brought him to the top of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said they offered one of the best performances of the evening.
Katz and executive producer at "DWTS" Rob Wade said they wanted to keep an open seat in the show for last-minute invited competitors, such as Skarlatos, who grew up in the public eye.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation who foiled a gun attack on a train with 500 passengers and immediately thought to invite one of them to the dance contest.
He searched social media, found family members, and sent messages to Skarlatos.
When he appeared on "Good Morning America" to tell the story of the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with ABC's sister program to avoid going through all media dams.
He supported his "five-minute plot", then looked forward to finding out if Skarlatos would accept to participate in the "DWTS".
"For a while everything was very uncertain, because this is so different from what he does," Katz confessed.
A little while ago he was fighting in Afghanistan, and now I was asking him if he wanted to dance.
Skarlatos, who is on short leave from the National Guard, had not even seen a whole show until recently.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be the only one who stood out.
The show could not invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace up their sleeve: Noah Galloway, war veteran, with his hand and leg amputated.
They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, the fans' favorite competitor and finalist of last season, and to ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, along with Katz's relentless "track" and "persistent messages," she said.
"Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army will be presented and how the image of my friends will be protected," Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Skarlatos, a great lover of sports and history, had never danced before, and Arnold confessed in interviews that he was trying to make him relax and give up his rather rigid military posture.
But Katz says she is confident that she will adapt and that the audience will react positively.
He's gonna get a lot of love from the start, because people are proud of him and what he did.
"How can you not support him?" said Katz.
But this will only take a few weeks.
To move on, he has to dance.
Skarlatos, who is a bachelor and wants to become a cop, says that so far, he has had fun in this completely unknown environment to him.
The program was the hardest fight, having to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the times when he was acclaimed in the media and the various awards ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the United States immediately after the train incident, he only wanted to relax with his family.
"That took about a day and a half," he said.
In all, I stayed home for four days.
There is a risk in capturing a person who attracts media attention, but is not used to being in the spotlight, said executive producer Wade.
And the show wants to make sure that the contestant manages and has fun.
"The pressure is great and we want the participants to have a pleasant experience," Wade said.
"We wouldn't want Alek to ever say, "Oh, boy, what have I gotten myself into?"
Let's keep his fingers crossed for fun.
McRib at McDonald's is back.
The time has come for those who wait all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-coasts to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of McDonald's franchises in the country offer this seasonal specialty.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served the McRib sandwich.
"The McRib promotion in 2015 is attended by about 8000 restaurants," McDonald's spokeswoman Lisa McComb told The Times in an e-mail.
In the US there are slightly over 14 300 restaurants of this fast food.
But according to McComb, individual franchise owners decide whether or not to serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they think their local customers want.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain the ingredients to him last year, with a video showing reality.
According to the video, the McRib sandwich is made of pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year at McDonald's restaurants.
There is also a website with locations where McRib (unaffiliated to McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and search the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search of the site shows that the nearest restaurant with McRib in Los Angeles is located in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can't fight the craving for BBQ chicken pizza.
Keith Richards suggests that you would prepare new Rolling Stones recordings
Keith Richards is back in the spotlight with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon the other members of the Rolling Stones may join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others at Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - had recently met in London and made "clear recording plans", as he says.
On Tuesday evening, Richards spoke in the ICONS series at iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from the Stones would be the band's first LP after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the band was not inactive at all.
In recent years they have had many stadium tours and played several small concerts in L.A., including performances at Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
At the last of these, they reinterpreted the classic 1971 LP, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular, Richards was busy this year, working on the documentary "Keith Richards: Under the Influence", scheduled to be released on Netflix on September 18.
This year, he released his third solo album, "Crosseyed Heart", in a five-decade career.
Randy Lewis of The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with the guitarist: "As always, Richards' harsh voice is a kind rather than distinguished instrument."
But Richards stirs up emotion in all 15 songs of the album, and that has always meant rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards says the band will most likely enter the studio after the South American tour early next year.
He gave no further details, but judging from the last concerts, the band is still very lively.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman on childhood, maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already gone through some difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them seem a lot simpler than they actually were.
Once a child actor in television shows such as "Silver Spoons", as an adult, he re-affirmed himself as a typical inexpressive on the television series "Situation of Crisis" and in films such as "The Nightmare Boss".
The first film he worked as a director was the very acidic comedy "Bad Words", in which he also starred.
The film was nominated for the International Toronto Film Festival in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The screenplay is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, Pulitzer Prize winner, and Nicole Kidman and Bateman in the film, as the brothers in trouble.
The film is about a festival seeking American distribution.
Many reviews of the book considered it a comedy with strong emotional tendencies; the film reinterprets the story, focusing more on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview with our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he has always considered the book more of a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen the book like this," he confessed.
In the book, the subject and the topics are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was dealing with a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which we saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
Monday night's world premiere received an introduction from festival program director Kerri Craddock, who expressed his enthusiasm especially for the sitcom "The Hogan Family" in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which Bateman worked on. "I never met too many fans "Hogan Family", said Bateman sec when he went on stage.
However, the few episodes he directed from that sitcom brought Bateman, now 46, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new film centered on a family named Fang.
The parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their shows, for example by planning a bank robbery with lollipops or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
In adulthood, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) strive to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she is famous for public scandals rather than performance, and Baxter is a novelist and magazine journalist who tries to become famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear under mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter suspect it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what in the story of children's actors who want to evolve in adult life was reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My baby was a very atypical one," Bateman confesses.
I started acting when I was 10, with my parents as managers, and this film has a lot of elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as superficial and fun.
"It's a story I feel connected to and I understand deeply," he added, "and although I didn't try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very clearly what this film should look like to represent children with a non-traditional childhood."
The project began with Kidman, also producer of the film, who obtained the rights to Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write the adaptation himself, Lindsay-Abaire was co-opted, who adapted his own play "Wake Up to Reality", in which Kidman played.
Bateman confesses that he accepted the chance to direct the film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in the production of "Photograph 51", did not participate in Monday's premiere.
The book's all-rounder was in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's film "an intelligent and caustic adaptation" that "gives the cliches of the highly exploited genre of dysfunctional family and dissects the mission, sometimes in a lifetime, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be funny and sweet-bitter, incisive and usually very dark.
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very harsh portrait" and noted that Bateman "proves visible progress and greater maturity as a film director with this cleverly structured adaptation, but never too cunning or mechanical.
After Monday's screening, when Bateman and Walken went on stage for the question session, the audience long cheered the beloved Walken.
About Bateman as a director and actor, Walken said during the Question Session that "He impressed me every day.
I couldn't believe the ease with which they were changing the work of director of the film, which is very difficult, and that of actor in the scenes.
His focus is really amazing.
In a certain dialogue scene, Bateman sits on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the darkness, just a shadow of the profile, while Kidman is closer to the camera and is more clearly visible.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor talking to Bateman the director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I find it incredibly interesting to direct films," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, they never make them to benefit me as an actor.
Having the privileged position of being the one responsible for creating the entire experience for the public, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a complete thing.
No matter what, that... actor wants a close-up.
During the question-and-answer session, Bateman confessed that after reading the script, he immediately thought of Walken for the role of Caleb, as well as of composer Carter Burwell for the soundtrack.
Known primarily for his long-standing friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell also composed the soundtrack for two other films at the Toronto festival: the animated film "Anomalisa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Gangsters of Legend", Brian Helgeland's interpretation of the 1960s English gangster twins Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell also wrote the soundtrack for Todd Haynes' film "Carol".
"Things with obtuse or elongated tones seem very interesting to me," Bateman says, explaining more on Tuesday.
Sail among those tonalities and guide the harmonious and somewhat elegant audience from one tone to the next during the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate among the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman took another bold step, both as a director and as an actor, in a career dominated by reinvention and determination, a mixture of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
As Bateman confessed when he finished his introduction for the film at Monday's world premiere, "For good, for bad, it came out exactly as I wanted it to.
The festival is like the Oscars about the Boston Globe investigation of pedophile priests.
Did you win $240,000 in the lottery?
A ticket to X-LOTTO worth over $240,000 has been unclaimed for a month.
The unregistered X-Lotto draw ticket was purchased at the Ingle Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd on Saturday, August 15.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, 16 other winning entries were registered throughout Australia, which split their unique prize pool of the US$4 million X-Lotto.
SA Lotteryes asks everyone who bought tickets to the X-Lotto at the Ingle Farm Lotteryes Kiosk to check them as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the X-Lotto 3555 draw on Saturday, August 15, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, manager of Ingle Farm Lotteryes Kiosk, says he looks forward to receiving the good news that the winner of the prize checked his ticket to the X-Lotto.
"We have tried very hard to spread the news, because one person is our winner and has no idea," she said.
Forensics detectives are searching the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where the missing man Daniel Hind was last seen.
Hind's sister, Chelsea Hind, said it was frustrating to sit around waiting for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of his journey the night he was last seen.
Her family had asked the police to search the house since her brother disappeared.
"We hoped they would search the house, we were not informed they would," she said.
Miss Hind also says that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids, and we have a lot of other family members, and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half of us think he's not.
Either way, we want him at home and to end the story.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometers of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635km of new highways and repair 17,000km of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of the work for the Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all of which are part of pan-European transport corridors, is among the priorities of the road infrastructure development plan approved on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure greater road safety and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is transit country for trafficking cultural goods in Syria
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for illicit trafficking of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East due to its geographical location.
During a speech Wednesday at a conference on the fight against looting Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was restored to fit the new context, emphasising a ban on cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said the efforts of the Ministry of Interior's competent units, especially the Directorate General for "Combating Organised Crime" (GDBOP) focused on preventing smuggling and illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed third, after Italy and Greece, in the top of the trafficking of cultural objects and goods.
Bulgaria's interior minister also showed that trafficking cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria are a phenomenon that has grown and is described as an extremely serious war crime.
He insisted that concerted and decisive measures are needed to stop the intentional destruction of history.
UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova noted that footage of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrates that the country is affected by industrial scale robbery.
Participants at Wednesday's conference acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously at risk and that the international community must unite to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods in the war-torn country.
Aerojet Rocketdyne says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
On Tuesday, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc said it expects to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will soon be banned, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funding from the US government.
Vice President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to give statements that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture with equal shares for the launch of the Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say the bid is a strategic movement of Aerojet to overcome its rival Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan missile.
The ULA says Blue Origin's engine program is about two years ahead of Aerojet's AR-1 engine, a statement Aerojet contradicts.
Working on new engines became a priority after US legislators approved a ban on the use of Russian engines RD-180 for the launch of US military or spy satellites, after Russia annexed the Crimean region of Ukraine last year.
Van Kleeck states that Aerojet was testing engine hardware, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to fit into both the ULA Atlas 5 rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and the new Vulcan rocket that the ULA is developing, and which costs about $1 billion.
Aerojet states that it will be less costly and less risky to integrate its engine into the Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a completely new engine and rocket, as the ULA currently plans.
Van Kleeck says Aerojet planned to start large-scale engine testing in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be postponed if the company does not receive enough funds from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first semester of the fiscal year 2016, starting in October.
She also states that the entire company was eager to see how the Air Force would divide some $160 million in funding among rival competitors.
It also says that Aerojet was thinking of trying other private financing options for the engine, but did not provide details.
Competition from the Air Force is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide one third of the funding and the Air Force covers two-thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both being private companies, have self-financed their engine creation process and say they are not necessarily looking for government funding.
AB InBev brewing company plans a $275 billion merger with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest brewing company, approached rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) about a takeover that would form a colossus that would produce one third of the total amount of beer in the world.
Such a merger would have a market value of around $275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev's dominance in Latin America with SABMiller in Africa, both representing fast-growing markets, but also their Asian breweries.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also a few places in Asia and Latin America," said analyst Andrew Holland of the Societe General.
AB InBev and other top brewing companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weaknesses in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirits.
SABMiller, the world's second-largest company and producer of over 200 brands of beer, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that she was informed of AB InBev's intention to make an offer, which must happen by 14 October at the latest, according to British laws.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private equity fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, famous for its marketing cost reduction policy, previously orchestrated the acquisition of Burger King, the ketchup producer Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A close source of the SAB noted that it was too early to say what it would do, as they did not receive any offers.
"At this point, we are waiting and deciding," the source said.
Speculation of a merger, which would most likely raise concerns about infringements of competition rules in markets such as the United States and China, has circulated for several years.
The timing of the approach, after more than a decade of purchases by AB InBev, follows a decrease of around 15% in the price of SABMiller shares as of August.
"This is exactly the moment they were waiting for," said analyst Phil Gorham of Morningstar.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least £40 (62 USD) per share of SAB Miller, perhaps even £45, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to $130 billion, which would also include the debt of SABMiller.
This would make it the biggest M&A transaction of 2015, which is already announced a record year after the financial crisis in 2008 in terms of the transaction amount, and one of the largest purchases since 1980.
The shares of SAB were close to 19.9% at £36.14, giving it a $90 billion stock exchange capitalisation.
AB InBev shares reached 6.4%.
Heineken Rivals (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could seek another merger as a defence strategy, as happened the previous year when it offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, he has combined his African bottle bottler with that of Coca-Cola (KO.N), and in recent weeks there has been a suspicion of a combination with Diageo or with the Australian liquor company Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The overall beer market share of AB InBev, producer Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to experts from Plato Logic industry.
AB InBev intends a two-fold ratio between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) from the current 2.5.
It is possible to achieve the target in 2016, the nearest realistic date on which the transaction could be concluded, so it would be able to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought Budweiser's production company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 for USD 52 billion, the largest cash purchase in history at the time. he let the ratio rise to over 5 times.
An as high climb would allow him to accumulate a debt of 100 billion.
Families controlling AB InBev own slightly more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders of SABMiller are the producer of Altria cigarettes (MO.N) and Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Altria refused to give statements that they had been approached by AB InBev, but on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said at an analysis conference that he regularly assesses investment in SABMiller and that "this time we believe that maintaining assets is in the interest of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, responsible for European investment, equity, at Allianz Global Investors, which owns shares in both companies, says AB InBev faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of income from small debts reaches somewhere around 15%.
But we believe that the profit from this acquisition would be a disappointing 8% percentage after 10 years," Dwane said.
In any combination there are significant difficulties related to the breach of competition rules, especially in the United States, where companies own about 70% of the beer market.
"The savings that could be made in distribution operations are high, and the obstacles related to the violation of competition rules are even higher," said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross Business School at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 per cent stake in the company held by SABMiller under the operating agreement governing it.
A change in control at SABMiller would automatically entitle Molson to obtain an additional 8 per cent and appoint a new CEO of the company.
Molson, based in Denver, would be entitled to the first and last bid for the remaining 50 percent.
A Molson spokesman refused to comment on whether the company was interested in an auction, but Molson's shares rose by more than 12 percent to their highest value.
Any merger may also have to sell shares in China, where the market leader is the CR Snow joint venture of SABMiller with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that after the collapses, the combined group could hold 28% of the global market.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is counseled by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accuse former Air Force pilot of helping al Qaeda
Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would later donate funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, police officers told Reuters on Wednesday, in a rare case targeting those who financially aid activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern town of Karachi.
He paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban militants at a hospital in the eastern city of Lahore, police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in an attack on a bus with members of the Ismaelian Muslim minority, which killed 45 people in May, the province's top police officer Naveed Khawaja told journalists of the Department for Combating Terrorism.
He will be charged with financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has also financed the Afghan Taliban, we are still conducting research to see if he has provided financial aid through his affairs or behind him is someone else," the officer said.
"Also, Ahmed also provided financial aid to AQIS," he said, referring to the Al Qaeda organisation on the Indian Subcontinent, an Al Qaeda branch founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces facing activism, corruption and murder.
After, in December, the Taliban riflemen massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government vowed to suppress activism.
There have been tough attacks, while the army has also advanced further into the tribal regions outside the law on the Afghanistan border.
But militant groups remain a threat and many have followers from Pakistani cities under the control of very poorly prepared police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52, used to preach at a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Housing Authority.
His public sermons were moderate, but in particular, he encouraged radicalism, the police said.
He studied at the Pakistan Air Force College in the town of Sargodha and left Pakistan's Air Force in 1998, another security official told Reuters anonymously.
He later entered the paint and chemical industry.
Rapper Rick Ross has been denied a copyright application for "Everyday I'm hustlin"
New York rapper Rick Ross cannot claim copyright for the words "Everyday I'm hustlin'", a US judge ruled, rejecting his complaint against the LMFAO music group, which sold T-shirts with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflelin'".
In a decision published by the Miami federal court on Tuesday, district judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross' slogan, a prominent part of his 2006 debut hit "Hustlin'", is an abbreviated expression for which the courts have mentioned several times that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams' court ruling weakens the copyright infringement suit that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, filed against the LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the electropop duet in Los Angeles, composed of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their own famous 2010 song "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm Shufflin'.
The hip hop star described LMFAO as "an obvious attempt to capitalize on Hustlin's fame and success".
He also sued Kia Motors for using the song "Party Rock Anthem" in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that the LMFAO had violated his copyright, selling T-shirts and other products with the shufflin' slogan.
In Tuesday's court ruling, Williams says that "Hustlin', as a song, is protected by copyright law.
But Ross' three-word slogan is made up of ordinary words and cannot have copyright, she said.
The judge compared it with other famous lyrics from music from the past, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it was "a short expression, which all courts unanimously declared impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the LMFAO song was an unauthorized copy of "Hustlin".
The trial is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO's lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, at the US District Court for Southern District, Florida, No.

Dr Carson approaches Trump in the latest Republican Party presidential poll
According to the latest presidential poll for 2016, novice politician Ben Carson approaches bombastic leader Donald Trump in the republican preliminary elections.
Carson scored 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped seven points in the polls.
After Trump's 27% endorsement in the latest poll of the CBS/New York Times, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, comes in second with 23 percent, followed by Bush, television star Mike Huckabee, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, each with 6%.
Support from Republican voters in the preliminary elections increased from early August to early September for Trump, Carson, Ohio Governor John Kasich and former CEO of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two remains, however, one-digit numbers.
Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, and the one carrying the Bush family standards, dropped by seven percentage points in a month, while the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker dropped by eight points.
In the last poll, support for Walker is 2%.
Carson drew greater support than Trump among college graduates (29% versus 21%), while Trump is ahead of Carson in the preferences of no-university voters (30% versus 19%).
Trump is supported more by men than by women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the poll said they were determined which candidate to support in their state's preliminary elections.
Those who said they knew who they were going to vote for support Trump twice as much as Carson.
It is still too early to say for 63% of Republican voters for the preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT poll conducted between 9 September and 13 September will be released on Tuesday, ahead of a republican presidential debate.
Carson's rise in this poll reflects that of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in front of the leader for the nomination of Democrats to the presidency, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The latest chase of the CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders climbed 10 points and 22 points in Iowa and New Hampshire, respectively, among the democratic voters for the preliminary ruling.
A leading ethics specialist says sex robots should be banned
A leading ethics specialist in the robotics industry launched a campaign calling for a ban on the development of sex robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, robotics expert at De Montfort University in Leicester, England, warns that sex robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
"Sex robots seem to be an increasingly important topic in the robotics industry, and the models from which they are inspired - the way they will look, the roles they will have - are very disturbing," she told the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sex robots is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
It is inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires the development of technology," she told Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will help increase sexual exploitation.
Although the sex robots that are being manufactured now are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they are the first step towards something more sinister.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we have to stop it from happening.
The industry certainly seems to be gaining momentum.
A few years ago, the inflatable puppet company True Companion launched Roxxxy, the world's first sex robot.
But concern about the possible dangers posed by artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among the major industry representatives.
Just this spring, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk wrote about “the risk of something truly dangerous happening in five years.
In an interview with the BBC last December, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of a complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race".
UK welcomes first refugees from Syria - RT UK
In the coming days, Britain will receive the first refugees to flee the Syrian war, Interior Minister Theresa May announced.
They will receive assistance under the government's extensive resettlement programme.
Asylum seekers arrive from camps bordering the war-torn country.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the interior minister said the government is "working quickly" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the UK, it is imperative that the assistance and support they need and deserve are already put in place.
I know that honourable Members and the general public want to know more about the number of people and the date when they are expected to arrive.
May noted that the government must make even more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate supplies when they arrive.
I must stress that the level of enlargement requires careful and meticulous planning to ensure that everything is going well.
Me and the Syrian refugee minister, Richard Harrington, will continue to keep the House informed on this.
But I am pleased to tell the House that we are waiting to meet the first wave of refugees in the coming days and we are working quickly to plan more arrivals in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew the wrath of lawmakers and militants when he unveiled the government's plan for refugees, with many feeling that the figure was too low.
In September, Cameron said in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will live up to its moral responsibility" and receive 20,000 refugees from the Middle East camps until the next general election.
He added that refugees would not automatically receive full asylum, but a humanitarian status that would allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics noted the figures were only 12 refugees a day, and former Liberal MP Paddy Ashdown said the measures were "disorientated".
Furthermore, Ashdown revealed that children included in the scheme are expected to be deported when they turn 18 if they do not receive asylum.
Major public stars and personalities also condemned the measures.
In a joint letter, big names like Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the response to the crisis was "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not simply thrown on the shoulders of countries close to the conflicts that drive people out of their homes," they wrote.
Rubla recovers amid global uncertainty - RT Business
The Russian ruble was reinforced on Wednesday, trading 65.66 against the US dollar and 73.98 against the euro at the Moscow Stock Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency earned seven percent from its lowest rate of 71 rubles for one dollar on 24 August.
Analysts say the return of the ruble was due to investors' reaction to the current global market turmoil caused by the weights of China, the possible increase in the US Federal Reserve's interest rate and the excessive reaction to cheap oil.
Brent's elbows increased by 61 cents on Wednesday, reaching $48.36 per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more at $45.31 per barrel.

"It is possible that volatility will say its word, fuelled by uncertainty about China and the timing of the federal interest rate increase, which will continue to set the tone for oil prices and ruble prices," Bloomberg Pyotr Matys of Rabobank, an expert on monetary policy strategies in emerging markets, established in London, said.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are linked to the US dollar, have started buying roubles.
Global markets await the decision of the Federal Reserve on Thursday, whether or not to increase the interest rate.
Markets believe that what could be the first US interest rate increase in nine years will not happen and traded at higher rates on Wednesday.
Nasa and the United Kingdom work together on the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the US government and companies like Google, Amazon and the Verizon phone company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to book airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
Collaboration comes as a result of a widespread anxiety about the possibility of an aerial collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes in vivid colors the potential negative effect.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capturing data in high density urban areas, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," says research.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, chaos could set in.
According to Detta O'Cathin, Baroness of the House of Lords, the concern increased amid reports of events at the limit of an accident and drone operation above football stadiums, close to the nuclear power plants and the Eiffel Tower.
"Over the past two years, more than 400 calls to metropolitan police have been linked to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
What is the solution: building a system that tracks all drones, especially those that fly at a height of less than 150 metres, whether driven by commercial pilots or amateurs.
"As more and more small drones fly low-altitude commercial flights beyond the pilot's visibility level, or even completely autonomous flights, some air traffic management infrastructure is needed to separate flights in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, for example delivery of parcels in cities," she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as airspace design, methods of avoiding adverse weather and wind conditions, congestion management, route planning and rerouting by means similar to the rules set for road traffic, such as signalers and lanes.
They expect to have a working prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is about to explode in the European Union in the coming years.
"We already see small and innovative SME companies in the UK using this technology with considerable effects in the energy, agriculture and media industries," says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 permissions for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150,000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Dislike button: why Facebook wants to know what makes you sad
"A Look Back" works similarly, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will that mean for the crowds of users inside Facebook's virtual borders, which are now more than the population of any country?
First, of course, an empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge value of Facebook - about 240 billion dollars after the last statistic - is due to the unimaginable amount of consumer data it has.
Every interaction, post, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkably complex image, in a permanent update, about yourself and about your preferences.
This is valuable primarily for advertisers, who can use all this information to carefully choose which people to see their ads on Facebook, selecting the ones that are most interested in their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and certainly opens a door for another type of advertiser to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who "appreciate" a national football team, charitable organisations and promoters want to address those who, for example, "empatise" with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see in News.
Facebook uses incredibly intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to narrow down that enormous universe of content that you might see in the smaller stream that you actually see.
This algorithm essentially depends on what you thought was interesting in the past and, above all, what you liked.
Without a doubt, there is a fear on Facebook that many interesting, but unfortunate posts do not go into the algorithm, because people do not feel that they should appreciate them.
However, if Facebook understands more about what is bothering you or makes you feel unhappy, it might decide to remove this type of posts from News.
Facebook has conducted experiments in the past to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional state and, above all, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
Representatives of the academic environment call this “emotional contamination” and, although it sounds sinister, it is probably just a simple attempt by Facebook (and published openly, with their agreement) to better understand how their platform works and if they can adjust algorithms to distribute more elements.
What happens to the empathy button is up to Facebook.
The really striking thing is how the decision of a single company to add a single button to its services can produce so much speculation.
The reason this is happening may be that the decisions made by Facebook -- whether it involves the visible buttons that we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden -- have profound consequences for us today.
Now we spend a significant part of our lives in the digital world, which we access to find everything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another which is constantly fighting for survival in the ferocious Darwinian world of social technology and networks.
The decisions they make, including with regard to new buttons, will be those considered most suitable to stay on the surface in this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with that, and soon they'll have a button for that.
Biometric bracelets can anticipate seizures in people with autism
During ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team determined that body signals can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, thus giving assistants the opportunity to take the right measures.
The autism kids we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say he has a headache or "there's too much noise here" or "I don't like this teacher."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body is telling us, and we need to do this in a gentle and unintrusive way.
For example, simple colour visualization in an application can show the level of agitation. Red can be used to warn about a change of behaviour, and blue for lack of interest, giving the assistant the idea that the person is bored and needs stimulation.
Bracelet data can be collected over time and saved on a secure server, helping carers to understand the overall picture of how the person responds to different situations and what would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to make it very clear that we don't read minds.
Biometric sensors are not magical. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team would work with producers to further develop this technology, to be specific to autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, director of customer services at the Wirral Autistic Society, who will present the technology at the 2015 Autech conference on autism and technology in Manchester on October 1.
When you work with people with severe autism, as we work, you see the spectacular difference that assistance technology can bring in their quality of life. Now, iPad applications literally give a voice to people who have never spoken.
Robots help autistic children learn to play hide-and-seek.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistance technologies can truly change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charity for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and are also part of the debate on how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the coming weeks"
In the coming weeks, French warplanes would launch air attacks on Isis targets in Syria, the government announced Wednesday, just days after President François Hollande had declared the intervention "necessary".
France will conduct its first air attacks on the Islamic State jihadist group in Syria "in the coming weeks," Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.
French air forces are conducting reconnaissance missions in Syria on September 8th, and the attacks will follow "in the coming weeks, as soon as we have clearly identified targets," Le Drian told France Inter.
Le Drian told parliament Tuesday that the Islamic State has made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern Aleppo region.
"In the small town of the Sea there is an extremely strong offensive, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Syrian Free Army or the Syrian national coalition or what's left of it," he said.
France is part of a US-led coalition that has been bombing Isis positions in Iraq for a year, but Hollande changed the strategy last week to expand actions in Syria, with political pressure amid the jihadist threat facing France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already engaged in attacks on Isis militants in Syria.
The iOS 9 ad blocking feature will make your phone even faster
The latest iOS 9 releases on Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying for online publishers - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new feature will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other advertising while using the mobile version of the Apple Safari browser.
In tests, it has been proven that after blocking ads, news sites such as the New York Times charge twice as fast, according to Reuters.
Also, blocking advertisements helps users preserve their data use and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from several ad blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular ad blocking tool for the desktop, has launched its own iOS web browser that limits ads; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
People who use software to block ads have a few constraints.
Advertising is still displayed in apps (this is where Apple earns money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such ad blocking features.
However, their use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
Their development poses great challenges for online media, which is largely offered to consumers free of charge and has been financially supported by advertising for many years.
A report says that blocking advertising could cost online publishers nearly 22 billion dollars in advertising revenues this year alone.
To enable ad blocking in iOS 9, users need to download an application to block ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to enable an extension to block content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the immigrant crisis with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama greeted Spain's King Felipe VI at the White House on Tuesday, where the two discussed various topics, but probably reduced to the importance of international co-operation.
Obama and the king have addressed the subject of the fight against the Islamic State and the growing crisis of immigrants in Europe - who are already facing hundreds of thousands of people who have left their country of origin to go west.
"Spain has worked very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travel, and the problem of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened over the past few months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially as the Spanish territory of Catalonia will vote in the elections to be held this month.
"As for foreign policy, we have made a firm commitment to maintain relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The commander-in-chief also told King Felipe that he would like to visit his country before the end of his term in 2017.
"We welcome you with open arms," Felipe replied.
The First Lady, Michelle Obama, gave the Queen a tour of the White House and they had a tea talk.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States of America since they ascended the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to pay a visit to South Florida.
Alfre Woodard joins "Luke Cage"
The famous actress Alfre Woodard has joined the cast of the upcoming Netflix Luke Cage series at Marvel. She will be the antagonist of Mike Colter, who plays the superhero who gives the title of the series.
Woodard will play the role of Mariah Dillard - "a local politician from Harlem and cousin of the recently announced character Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes, played by Mahershala Ali - who plans to bring an era of change to the streets on which she grew up," a press release says.
Her personal life and career are being turned upside down by Harlem's newest hero, Luke Cage, but also by the infamous actions of her cousin Cottonmouth.
"Alfre has an incredible, unique and intimidating presence on the screen, which makes it perfect for the leading role of the Harlem community," says Jeph Loeb, executive producer and president Marvel Television.
We are delighted that an actress as famous and talented as Alfre has agreed to join us in this adventure.
The show will premiere in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Coker will write the first two episodes and work as showrunner and executive producer.
Woodard, 62, is known for her TV series Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, L.A. Law, Desperate Wives and Law Office, as well as the Devil's Advocate films, Mysterious Obsession, The Family That Preys, 12 Years of Slavery, and Annabelle.
Luke Cage is one of the four Marvel series in the Netflix franchise.
Also soon will be running Jessica Jones and Iron Fist, but also the second season of Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" premiere world on the same day
Fox predicts many positive results ahead of the premieres of two of his most expected series: Scream Queens and Empire.
The first season of Queens and the second season of Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels a day after the internal premiere.
As Variety relates, the strategy is a trend applied for high profile series, as traffic from global social networks guarantees success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to value the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for shows that are talked about a lot, such as Empire and Scream Queens," Fox International channel president Hernan Lopez said, according to Deadline.
"We can't wait to air these very interesting shows for fans all over the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve daily bring the success of a show to the premiere and throughout its life cycle.
The next season of the Empire, in which famous celebrities like Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox will play, premieres in September.
The new series "Scream Queens", starring Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande, will air the following day in September.
Members of the British Royal Family will participate in the world premiere of "Spectre"
Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend the world premiere of James Bond's latest film, "Spectre".
Kensington Palace announced the news on Twitter on Wednesday, naming the premiere as Royal Film Performance for Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a producer press release, "Spectre" is the third Bond film chosen as a PFF since 1946.
In the past, for the royal premieres were also selected "Don't Die Today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on 26 October at Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charitable event, which will benefit the backstage employees in the British film and television industry.
The premiere will also include actors in the film's cast, including Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Director Sam Mendes and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also go on the red carpet with members of the royal family.
"Spectre" will be broadcast in U.S. cinemas in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The model Christie Brinkley and musician John Mellencamp were seen having dinner together on Monday, sparking a rumor that the two of them had a romantic relationship.
The two met for dinner at the Bowery Hotel in New York City, where photos caught Brinkley smiling and cheerful.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing jeans, sneakers and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in torn jeans, coats and boots.
Last October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend, whom he broke up with and was constantly reconciled with, actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the star in the Message for you on NBC's Today show, saying it was "an angel who was sent to me and I am very happy".
He added that "nothing ends until it's over".
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, posed for Seventeen magazine, following in her mother's footsteps.
Arctic mosquito clusters are large enough to bring down a karibu
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable due to the ever warmer climate, but global warming has proved to be a benefit to others.
One of these species advantaged is the Arctic mosquito.
According to researchers at Dartmouth College, warmer temperatures in the Arctic region allowed mosquitoes here to appear earlier and grow higher, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their field observations to illustrate the effects of temperature changes on Arctic mosquitoes.
Their analysis predicts a 50% increase in the survival rate of adult mosquitoes with a 2 degrees Celsius increase in temperature.
Mosquitoes are small, but they are important members of the Arctic and ecosystem food chain.
The new analysis - detailed in a new paper published in the Processings of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists better anticipate how a growing mosquito population could affect the karib they feed on, the birds and insects that feed on them and the plants they pollinate.
To build their demonstration, Dartmouth scientists combined their field results with the results of laboratory experiments that researched how temperature influences insect development and the predisposition to be hunted by predators.
Although the rise in temperature makes larger mosquitoes more vulnerable to the coleoptera, it also gives them an early start in the spring and makes the development of their larvae faster and more effective, which is certainly an advantage.
Several mosquitoes mean a larger population, but they can only grow to the extent that insect food sources can sustain them.
The ability of mosquitoes to transform their improved survival rate into an improved reproductive rate depends on their ability to provide their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies so that the administration of antidepressants to pregnant women has no effect on the neural or behavioural development of their children.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are at increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have said that depression is an even greater risk for women and their children, therefore it must be treated.
"These studies are adding to an increasing set of evidence on the safety of antidepressant administration during pregnancy," John Thorp, deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said in a press release, published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, so far evidence seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are greater than those raised by antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on motor development of children whose mothers were treated with SSRI, analysing the data of 51,404 children from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, researching the effects of SSRI use for motor skills development at the age of 3.
Researchers found that 381 mothers had used SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of them were treated with drugs for a prolonged period.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in motor development, researchers wrote in the study that the combination “was not so significant as to attach clinical importance to delay”.
A group of researchers at Adelaide University in Australia conducted an examination of data for 49,000 women in the Danish National Birth Cohort to discover the effects of administration of SSRI on the behaviour of children up to the age of 7.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
In 210 children whose mothers had been treated against SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems compared to 231 children who were more prone to behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and social problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more prone to bleeding after birth if treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who gave birth at a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal haemorrhage increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers have reported.
Researchers said that although the study linked administration of SSRIs at increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information researchers have had about women's specific medical conditions - which could have had an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"It is possible that women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy were those with the worst stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal haemorrhage, not antidepressants," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
Based on this study alone, we do not recommend that women stop taking medication against depression during pregnancy, but be closely monitored to reduce as much as possible the risk of potential bleeding.
Matthew is charged with murder in the murder of a Virginia Technical University student.
The man charged with the murder of student Hannah Graham at Virginia University was indicted for qualified murder in the case of a student at Virginia Technical University who disappeared in 2009, authorities announced on Tuesday.
The grand jury in Albemarle, Virginia, charged on Friday Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 33, Charlottesville, for the murder of Morgan Harrington, officials say.
Matthew is also charged with kidnapping with intent to rape.
Every count gets the maximum life sentence.
Harrington, 20, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the impeachment brought them relief.
"For six years we have been working decisively and unabatedly for this purpose," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm delighted to know that when you take someone's life, you have to face the consequences of your doing.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominoes of the consequences began to be placed.
Police say there is a forensic link between Harrington, Graham and a 2005 sexual abuse in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty of the latter and is awaiting sentence in this case.
He stays in prison in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew charged with murder in the case of the death of a student at Virginia University
Harrington had gone to U-Va on October 17, 2009, along with his friends, to a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington left the John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and could not go back in.
She was last seen trying to take a cab around 8:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was wearing a black panther T-shirt.
After her disappearance, Harrington's purse and cell phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The family and friends began an extensive search of Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. Metallica wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt he was wearing was found near a string of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated field on a farm southwest of Charlottesville.
During the time of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew had worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it is not clear whether that period overlapped with the date when Harrington disappeared.
Police say a significant advance in the Harrington case was the arrest of Matthew in the case of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases are linked by DNA evidence.
Investigators have not yet released the details of the new evidence that led them to press charges against Matthew for the murder of Harrington.
Defence lawyer Douglas Ramseur, representing Matthew in the Graham case, refused to give statements.
The indictment announcement comes two days after Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both were young students who disappeared when they went out in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a mall downtown near U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for the case a few weeks later after a nationwide search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be on trial for qualified murder in the Graham case.
In the first days after Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at the meetings and vigils organized for the missing U-Va student.
Harrington says she endured for her daughter speculation and criticism in the media that must be silenced by the new charges against Matthew.
"All this time there have been discussions like "Why was he wearing a short skirt?" and "He was asking for it?" but this kind of questions and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we are dealing with a predator on the hunt," Harrington added.
In the Fairfax County case, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault against a young woman in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 years old at the time of the attack, told the jury that one September evening, while she was walking home from the store, a stranger came behind her.
He took her to a green zone, beat her and strangled her, then sexually attacked her.
"I thought it was the end of me, that I had to scream constantly," the woman confessed.
I was afraid I was going to die.
Matthew suddenly ran away, the woman said.
A prosecutor told the jury that Matthew may have been scared by the headlights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was convicted years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will receive the sentence in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said he would most likely come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least today I took another step," says Dan Harrington.
Did Jon Snow die or not?
Actor Kit Harington gives us a clue
Actor Kit Harington gave an important clue about the fate of his character in the series Games of Thrones, Jon Snow, who was killed at the end of season four.
In an interview with the Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knew how long his contract would last with HBO, according to Digital Spy.
Asked in how many seasons he would appear, he said he could not talk about it.
Let's just say the show will be a part of my life for a while, I'll probably be over 30 when it's over.
But one thing's for sure.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, then it will be the moment when I will bury myself in projects with feature films," the actor said.
The show returns to the small screens next spring.
The fans of Games of Thrones triggered a hysteria after the end of season four, when Jon Snow was stabbed and released various theories, according to which he will somehow be brought back to life.
Moreover, the Romans created an event on Facebook, called "Jon Snow's Postage", 40 days after the end of the season, which gathered over 36,000 supporters.
Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the "Economic Competitiveness" and "Environment" programmes, both interrupted in early April 2015.
According to a communication by the European Commission's Romanian Representative, following this decision, about 120 million euros will be transferred to the Romanian authorities in the next period.
I am glad to be able to announce the release of these payments and I appreciate the efforts made by the Romanian authorities to improve the management and control systems of the two programmes.
It is important that the Romanian authorities were involved in identifying weaknesses and solving problems.
"I express my hope that the measures taken will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," European Commissioner for Regional Policy Corina Cretu said.
"The extremist statements made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," the head of Hungarian diplomacy reacted.
Peter Szijjarto asked the European socialists to stop the "champania of lies" against Hungary.
Referring to statements made by Harlem Desir, French Secretary of State for European Affairs on the Hungarian fence, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "supports a common European immigration strategy", but insists that national borders must be protected.
Romania wants to hit the rugby World
Romania's rugby national is ready for a big surprise at the World Cup which will begin on Friday in Britain.
The Oaks set out to win two Group D victories.
"We want two victories, with the teams of Canada and Italy," said Mihai Macovei, captain of Romania.
Nationala "tricolora" is part of Group D at the World Cup in England, along with France, Ireland, Canada and Italy.
Romania's first match at the 2015 World Cup edition will be played on 23 September, the opponent being France.
Refugee crisis: JHA with no solution
European Council President Donald Tusk announced that he will take a decision Thursday on whether to convene a European Union summit on migration to Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann called on Tuesday for a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis.
In a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said Germany, Austria and Sweden could not manage the refugee crisis alone.
The head of the German executive expressed his support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls in the face of the massive influx of asylum seekers, noting that the measure aims to facilitate the registration of refugees.
In turn, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposal to redeploy refugees between Member States on the basis of binding quotas - has decided to hold an extraordinary EU summit.
EU interior ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday evening, failed to adopt the new proposal for emergency redeployment of 120,000 refugees between EU Member States, presented by the European Commission on 9 September.
The first point of the plan, represented by the refugee emergency relocation mechanism, provides for the rapid redistribution of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50.400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, new controversial cartoons
The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo is once again causing controversy after the publication of cartoons that mock the response of predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants in predominantly Muslim countries affected by wars.
In its most recent issue, the publication again attracted attention, as well as criticism on social networks, the Reuters agency writes.
One of the drawings depicts a heartbreaking image of Aylan Kurdi, the drowned Syrian boy, whose body arrived on one of the beaches of Turkey, after a failed attempt to cross the sea by boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
The drawing from Charlie Hebdo shows a child in shorts and T-shirt, face down on the shore of the sea, next to a billboard that offers two children's menus for the price of one.
"So close to succeeding," is the message that accompanies the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack at the Paris office in January, is accompanied by the message "Province that Europe is Christian".
The drawing presents a character like Jesus, who walks on water, while a smaller character wears short pants with his feet up in the water, the first saying "Christians walk on water", takes the second "Muslim children drown".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression after being the target of an attack by Islamist militants in January following repeated threats following the ridicule of the prophet Mohammed.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, drastically amended in Russia
The French supermarket chain Auchan was fined over $370,000 by Russian officials, charged with food safety violations.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor, said the fines total more than 25 million rubles, i.e. $372,000, reports US News quoted the Associated Press Agency.
However, the reasons for these fines were not specified, and Auchan did not comment.
Also, the French supermarket chain is the target of the Russian agency's accusations for agriculture, which claims that some meat products have been found to be infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come in a time of tension between France and Russia, on the issue of extending the sanctions of the European Union and France's decision to cancel an agreement on the supply of Mistral ships to Russia.
The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has reacted to the news that Hungary could erect a metal fence at the border with our country.
The MAE shows that it has been briefed on this decision and that this is not a politically correct gesture.
MAE shows, in a communication submitted to Ziare.com, that he was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention shortly before being publicly announced.
In turn, MAE informed competent decision makers in Romania about this situation in due course.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considered that lifting a fence between two Member States of the European Union and which are strategic partners is not a politically correct gesture in line with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian side, it is also shown in the communiqué.
Hungary plans to build a metal fence on a segment of the border with Romania in the context of the immigrant crisis, Mediafax quoted Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto as saying on Tuesday.
"The measure is necessary because traffickers who transit Serbia are changing their routes, there is a likelihood that they will head for Romania," explained the head of Hungarian diplomacy.
"The guard would start at the border point between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue on a reasonable distance if the migration pressure moved to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants transiting the Serbian territory on their way to the European Union were trying to bypass the fence built by Hungarian authorities through its eastern end, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can bypass the fence through the area of Majdan/Rada (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
Hungary's government has allocated 22.2 billion forints (71.8m euros) to build a controversial metal fence at the border with Serbia for 175km, and to special centres needed to accommodate immigrants.
The initiative of the fence is criticised by the European Union and Serbia.
There's no need, he'll stay there.
The coffin of Corneliu Vadim Tudor's inanimate body will not be deposited in the Romanian Senate, despite the desire expressed by the widow of the politician.
According to a communiqué sent to Ziare.com, the Permanent Bureau of the Senate discussed on Tuesday a request by Doina Vadim Tudor regarding the approval of the deposition of the inanimate body of former Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor in the Senate headquarters.
"From the receipt of this letter until the moment of analysis, in the Permanent Office, the body has already been deposited at a place of worship and will remain there, the Permanent Office assessing that it no longer needs to be moved from there to the Romanian Senate", says the Senate.
PNL Senator Teodor Atanasiu claimed that this request "does not agree with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
Also, says Agerpres, the senators held a moment of silence in memory of the former PRM leader, at the proposal of UNPR Senator Serban Mihailescu.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died, Monday evening, around 6:30.
The PRM chairman passed away at the Army's Emergency Centre for Cardiovascular Diseases.
The MEP will be buried Thursday at 12:00 at Ghencea Cemetery and will receive military honors.
Do refugees come to Romania?
Mayors from the border localities, questioned about the accommodation places
Mayors from the border localities in Arad county are being questioned by the Police and Border Police, these days, regarding the accommodation places for eventual refugees who could arrive in Romania, but also for gendarmes, if they will be mobilized at the border.
The adile of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this topic.
Discussions were held including with farmers in the area, who were asked to report on the presence of any foreigners near the border.
I've had discussions with border guards, national police and local police, as well as farmers in the area.
We all have to be more vigilant in the next period.
"We have asked farmers, who have work in this period on arable land, to be careful and report any movement," the adile said.
Immigrant crisis boils in Hungary: Armored and water cannons on the border
He, like other mayors in the Hungarian border area, said the police had asked for information on the accommodations available in case of a wave of refugees.
We've been asked how many people we can accommodate.
In our village we have no spaces for refugees.
We believe that such special centers should not even appear at the border, because they are harder to control here, the migrants are tempted to flee, because they are not interested to stay in Romania.
It would be best to set up such centres in areas further away from the border," Iratosu municipality Mayor Papp Atila Joseph said.
In turn, the mayor of Dorobanti, Vincentiu Almasi, said that he was asked both accommodation places for refugees and for intervention forces, in case they were mobilized in the area.
The police have asked if we can accommodate the gendarmes.
We could find places in the Cultural Home, but for refugees we have no way of staying.
"We have also been questioned about the length of the border with Hungary, probably a plan of action is being worked out," Vincentiu Almasi said.
He added that to the local police station, "since Tuesday, since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, it has been established permanently".
"There's always a policeman at the station, and the locals know they have to inform if they notice any strangers in the area," the aedil said.
The representatives of Pilu City Hall said they can accommodate up to a hundred people, at the Cultural Home, the information being provided to the police, at their request.
Also, the mayor of Curtici, Nicolae Aanitei, said that there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of the local public finances, but there are necessary facilities.
Also, a former Border Police barracks could be set up to host refugees.
Representatives of the Arad County Police Press Office did not offer a point of view regarding the questioning of mayors during this period, confirming only that "the patrol activities were intensified in the border localities of Arad county".
Commander of the Army Club announces radical measures against Becali's Star
Commander of the Army Sports Club, Colonel George Boroi, announces a series of radical measures to be taken against Gigi Becali's Star.
Although the two sides have negotiated a reconciliation, Boroi claims that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historical record of the "Red Blues".
The team that won the Champions Cup is on break for now.
"It's not a historical break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have the team, but things can change next year," Boroi said at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announces that the process by which he claims damages from Becali's team will continue.
The period referred to by the ICCJ decision is set very clearly.
We must recover the damage from FC Steaua, the team that used the brand Steaua without the consent of the owner - meaning CSA Steaua.
It also appears very clearly the continuity of the section, which was in fact permanent of the Army Club.
"So Steaua Bucuresti football team, in one form or another, but in a legal form, there must be a continuation of the performances that it has so far in the record," says George Boroi.
The Star of Becali and the Army Club have been at war since the end of last year, when the supreme court ruled that it was the military who owned the "Star".
Simona Halep injured at US Open: The first Romanian declaration
Simona Halep crashed at the US Open, as the world's second player admitted on Wednesday.
The number two WTA has revealed that it has suffered a muscle stretch, and at the moment there is a specialized treatment.
I've suffered a small stretch and I'm doing a treatment.
"I hope to recover as soon as possible," Halep said at a press conference.
Simona Halep has evolved in the last two matches at the US Open with a reputable bandage over the left thigh, accusing muscle problems.
Immediately after returning to Romania, she made a visit to the sports medicine clinic with which she has been working for a long time.
After the special investigation, Simona was prescribed a treatment.
Halep will be back in competition next week when he plays in China at the Guangzhou tournament.
The region that is crawling with millionaires.
The Asian-Pacific millionaires will form, this year, the group of the richest people in the world, thanks to the wealth accumulated in China and India, a study published by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management on Wednesday.
According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated wealth of Asian Pacific millionaires will exceed the total of $15,800 billion recorded in 2014, as well as the wealth of North American millionaires, who currently represent the richest people in the world, with a cumulative wealth of $16,200 billion, the AFP submits.
The study states that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, named in financial jargon High Net Worth Individuals, HNWI, with 4.69 million of these individuals in 2014, compared to 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are people who can invest at least a million dollars, without taking into account the value of real estate and other possessions.
"In the future, the wealth of HNWI is expected to grow more in Asia Pacific than in any other region of the world, with most of the new assets coming from emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand," says the study by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
The report estimates that China and India account for almost 10% of the global wealth of HNWI and are responsible for 17% of the global growth of new assets after 2006.
China, the world's second economy after the US, had in 2014 890,000 millionaires with a cumulative wealth of $4,500 billion, increasing by 17.5% and 19.3%, respectively, compared to 2013.
India, in turn, has the fastest pace of increasing the number of millionaires, 26.3%, up to 198,000 people, while their cumulative wealth has increased by 28.2%, up to 785 billion dollars.
"Dorel" mounted the traffic light backwards.
In Suceava, the workers set up a traffic light upside down, so instead of being notified that they have four seconds to wait, passersby get the message "h", which they don't know how to decipher.
It's all right, most people run a red light anyway, inform the truth.
Each one passes as his head is cut off.
Two boys were about to be picked up by a car because they ran a red light.
"The police at the Road should be here to help, until people get used to it," a woman told the quoted source.
The traffic light was recently mounted in front of the Great Market in the centre of Suceva, but passersby do not seem at all eager to take it into account, especially as the information received seems to be incomprehensible.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" was doing his job properly and someone was responsible enough to give up his okay to conclude the work, then it would never have come to this absurd situation.
The Head of Street Administration and Road Systematization Service at Suceava City Hall candidly admit that he was there when the traffic light started to work, but he didn't realize that anything was wrong.
We put them into use, but we didn't realize it was an error.
"I myself was there when they were put into operation," Stefan Vasincu said, promising that the problem would be resolved as soon as possible.
Thank God it can be fixed, because there are situations where "Dorel" has done irreparable damage.
For example, when he worked on the Giurgiu-Ruse gas pipeline, "Dorel" lost the drilling drill that dug the tunnel under the Danube, there is no telling where, probably underground, buried, however, was not to be found, as the Minister of Economy himself, Mihai Tudose.
Police put water cannons on immigrants
At Hungary's main border with Serbia, Hungarian border guards used water cannons and tear gas against immigrants on Wednesday.
Although Hungary closed the border with a barbed wire fence and introduced harsh measures against illegal immigrants, including arrest, on the Serbo-Hungarian border continued to gather refugees, writes The Guardian.
Water cannons were put into operation when immigrants managed to break through the barbed wire fence through the Roszke border crossing.
The Hungarian police claim that the action of the cannons was a measure of crowd control, which threw water bottles.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people were crying after the use of tear gas.
The Greek publication Enikos writes, at the same time, that two German companies refuse to deliver barbed wire to Hungary.
The country has already raised the fence on the Serbian border and announced its intention on Tuesday to raise one on the Romanian border, the initiative strongly criticised in Bucharest.
German companies claim that barbed wire is very dangerous and cause infected cuts.
It is used to secure prisons or military installations, but should not be used against people seeking shelter, support companies.
In parallel with clashes on the Hungarian border, Croatia has mobilized to provide bus immigrants with the transport of those who show up at the country's border with Serbia.
The Croatian Interior Ministry confirmed that buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia from Serbia, including 73 children, the ministry also said.
Tsipras on Greece's drama - why he agrees to the third agreement with the EU
The declared goal of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from further austerity and fundamentally change its relationship with the EU leadership in Brussels.
Finally, the leader of Syriza made Greece part of a third loan agreement for the country, which involved even more years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which is conducting an interview with him.
Now, however, Tsipras is urging the Greeks to once again entrust him with the prime minister's mandate in elections that he claims will strengthen his political position.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the dismantling of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of restructuring the debt for Greece remains open," the former Greek prime minister also said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be decrised as a strict one.
"But we knew from the beginning that any compromise would have ended in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
He believes that the financing part of the agreement is a great success for the Greek government, showing that all the financial needs of the country are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says Greece " definitely needs reforms," specifying that it must start with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, opening the way for early elections in September, after 7 stormy months at the head of the Athens Executive, during which a third rescue loan was approved for Greece.
He got a broken neck and first-degree burns after he blew up in front of his electronic cigarette.
A 23-year-old man in Georgia suffered first-degree burns, neck and finger fractures and a coin-sized hole in his palate, after an electronic cigarette he smoked exploded in his face.
James Lauria was taking a short smoke break at work, when the incident occurred after which he remained in intensive care for a week, writes The Daily Mail.
Lauria, who was connected to a breathing apparatus, also suffered burns to the hand and cornea and a front tooth entered his gum.
I was at work and things were quiet and I went out for a second, just like I always do.
"In retrospect, it exploded and I was on my way to the hospital in an ambulance, that's the last thing I remember," Lauria said.
Six weeks after the accident, Lauria still cannot swallow solid food and follows a liquid diet while recovering from her parents' home.
The electronic cigarette that caused the man's injuries is in the custody of the authorities, conducting an investigation into the incident.

Star Trek actress in jail for undressing in front of children.
Actress Jennifer Lien, known from Star Trek, where she played for three seasons, impersonating Kes, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that took her to prison, where she was on September 3rd - bail being set at $2,500 - took place outside her house in Tennessee.
The star started arguing with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of his crying children, he informs Mirror.
At one point, during the dispute, the actress lifted up her shirt, showing her bust, and then, before entering the house, took off her pants.
When the police came, Jennifer refused to dress.
Moreover, it threatened to kill the cops and was forced to drive to the car.
This is not the first time that 41-year-old actress has had problems with the police; in April, she was also arrested, then she was guilty of the attack.
Jennifer entered Kes's shoes in 1995, and then appeared in "American History X", a film in which Edward Norton also starred.
He quit acting in 2002, when his first child was born.
She is married to film writer and producer Phil Hwang.
They're being targeted with the Western machine gun.
Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar al Assad gave a rare interview to Russian media, in which he talks about refugees and accuses the West of supporting terrorists and of "taking aim" at immigrants.
"The West has been crying for them and the West has been supporting terrorists since the beginning of the crisis, when it said this is a peaceful revolt," Assad said in an interview with Russia Today.
The leader in Damascus claims that his Western counterparts say the situation in Syria is terrorism like the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president".
As long as this propaganda follows, they'll have more refugees.
So it's not about the fact that Europe didn't accept or embrace them as refugees, it's about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, stop supporting terrorists.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of the whole refugee issue," the Syrian leader added.
Assad continued the charges against Western states as well as the treatment they show towards refugees.
It is as if the West is now crying for refugees with one eye and targeting them with a second-eyed machine gun, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, mainly because of terrorists and crimes and secondly because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and you have the destruction of infrastructure, you will not have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to make a living somewhere in this world," says Bashar al Assad.
"If we ask any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," the Syrian president stressed, adding that political forces, whether inside or outside the government, "should unite around what the Syrian people want".
The President of Syria believes that dialogue in his country should continue "to reach a consensus", which cannot be implemented "unless we defeat terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask all forces to unite against terrorism, because it is how we, as Syrians, can achieve the political goals that we want through dialogue and political action," Bashar al Assad also said.
He also spoke about one of his country's allies, Russia's President Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, he was transformed, from a friend of the West, into his enemy.
Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria to Russia, once again accusing the West of falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after the Ukrainian coup.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a Tsar.
He is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses the opposition in Russia and who came to power by undemocratic means, despite being elected in democratic elections, and the West itself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now they're not democratic.
"This is Western propaganda," the leader of Damascus scored.
Last but not least, it included Russia on the list of friends - and regional partners - with whom Syria is prepared to co-operate in the fight against terrorism, along with Iran and Iraq, "because it is facing the same type of terrorism".
Instead, Bashar al Assad criticised Turkey, another neighbouring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said "they cannot make a move without first coordinating with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, Syria's president accuses the "international school" led by the United States, which fights terrorism: "In fact, since this coalition started operating, the Islamic State has begun to expand."
In other words, the coalition has failed and has no impact on the ground.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight terrorism.
You can't be with and against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will sting you - then we have no objection to co-operating with all these countries, given that it is a real and not false coalition that fights terrorism," the Damascus leader also said.
Autumn?
No way.
More than 30 degrees
The weather will be quite warm on Wednesday, especially in the western part of the country, where temperatures will pass 30 degrees.
Bucharest will register 26 degrees at noon.
Two degrees less will be on the coast, while the mountains also announce 26 degrees, in Brasov.
There will be 21 degrees left at Moeciu, 23 at Bran, 23 at Cold Para, 20 at Predeal and 20 at Busteni.
A little warmer weather will be in the west of the country, where the mercury in the thermometers will pass the threshold of 30 degrees.
There will be registered 31 degrees at Satu Mare, 29 at Zalau, 30 at Cluj Napoca, 31 at Oradea, 28 at Alba Iulia, 30 at Arad, Timisoara and Caransebes.

Map of the countries with the highest discounts and how Romania stands
The collapse of oil prices has caused heavy losses in the last year to the workers in oil extraction, to the shareholders of energy companies and to the countries that depend heavily on this resource.
But there was also a positive effect: the gas has gone down enormously.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that, between October 2014 and July 2015, in almost all 76 countries counted, fuel prices fell.
The most important discount on the pump is observed in Venezuela.
In this country, diesel has been reduced by 97%, so you can power 24 SUVs with less than a dollar.
At the opposite pole is Saudi Arabia, where the price is held by the state.
The cost of gas oil varies from country to country, depending on the refining conditions, changes in taxation, as well as fluctuations in the currency rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price in each state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
Bloomberg data shows that in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (about 3.8 litres) was $5.49.
Thus, we rank 27th among the countries with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about that top position.
Compared to the last quarter of 2014, gasoline has also been cheaper for the Romans.
At the time, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which is a 10.6% discount.
However, the surrounding countries are even better off.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of gasoline costs $4.92, and in Hungary - $5.20.
The Germans plot the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised on Tuesday night that the federal government would provide additional support to the 16 federal states in receiving and distributing tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through southern Europe.
After a close four-hour meeting with prime ministers in the 16 federal states, Merkel said "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to cope with the large number of refugees," the DPA agency notes.
She added that the federal government would create 40,000 seats for initial arrivals, as well as distribution centers.
"Such pivot points are needed," she stressed.
The whole country must provide a massive boost to cope with the crisis, Merkel added.
The Länder's prime ministers sought more help than the 6 billion euros agreed by the federal government coalition more than a week ago.
Turkish Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow of the Left Party asked for a "at least double and for commitments to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
In turn, the Prime Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also businesses, unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also called for bureaucracy in the manipulation of refugees and migrants to be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland had completed processing in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
Prime Minister of Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
So far, Bavaria carries the most heavy burden, with most migrants arriving after crossing the Austrian border.
Seehofer, a powerful actor on the federal stage as head of the Christian-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, came into public conflict with Merkel after the chancellor announced a virtual door policy opened at the beginning of the month, DPA recalls.
Mircea Lucescu makes a scandal after the humiliating defeat with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nervous wreck at the end of the match with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donetsk lost 0-4.
The Romanian coach appeared totally disturbed by the arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost because she was disadvantaged.
Before the game, I said one thing, that I wanted to be respected.
Unfortunately, in matches with major teams in Europe we are always disadvantaged by arbitrage.
They're two totally different manners.
We are given a yellow card immediately, while the top teams are not.
Besides, the first penalty was by no means!
The ball hit Darijo in the back without touching his hand.
A game of this level should not have been influenced by arbitration.
"I regret that arbitration ruined the game," Mircea Lucescu said at the press conference.
"Ma'am, what smells so bad in here"?
There were pieces of the husband cut up.
A murder of an extraordinary sadism terrified the inhabitants of Fair Charming and Roman.
Yesterday morning, early in the day, the marketers in Fair Frumos could see terrifying scenes near the main entrance to the market.
Next to the three dumpsters, forensics had "assembled" from pieces what appeared to be the body of a man.
It was cut, but it lacked head, internal organs, and genitals.
In the end, it would turn out to be the body of a former officer, who had been cut down by his wife, a geography teacher.
The "Iași Paper" spoke at length with the taxi driver who helped the killer, without knowing it, carry the sacks with the body torn apart.
His stories make your hair stick.
The one who alerted the police yesterday to the fact that a woman carried three bags that smelled awful, after pieces of the body had been found at the market, was a taxi driver from Fair Frumos.
As in American films, the man helped himself to transport sacks full of human pieces, which smelled heavy, but without knowing it, the killer being a client for a race.
The cabbie told an exclusive story about "The Daily of Iași", the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide the evidence.
He carried with his hands the body parts of his Geography teacher's husband, whom he had cut.
She had come to Fair Charming to hide the evidence of the crime as far away from her residence as possible in Roman.
Maybe he's got lambs.
I couldn't have known.
Nea Mihai, as he is known by his friends who practice taxi in Fair Frumos, became an overnight star in the small town where he lives.
He has seen American films throughout his life, but never thought he would ever get to be the one who would be the basis of the discovery of a sadistic crime, and see with his own eyes pieces of corpses.
He relates that on Monday night to Tuesday, he usually waited for the arrival of buses that regularly transit through the village.
It was close to the intersection of the roads to Roman and Pascani.
The cabbie tells that the killer woman noticed her in the rearview mirror, next to the body bags supported by the indicator showing the nearby towns.
She came in the night with the Massaro race at 1.30.
The bus left it 10 meters from the pedestrian crossing from Pașcani, right at the terminal where it displays the mileage.
The bags were fastened by the sign with the indicator.
After the bus left, I gave in the reverse 10 meters to her.
I opened the trunk and, after putting a bag, I said, "Ma'am, what smells so bad in here?"
I saw she was an old woman, and I thought I'd help her.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, to the market, maybe he had lambs, I couldn't have known.
I also thought maybe he wanted to poke someone with that smelly meat.
She was trying to pick up a bag alone, and I rushed in to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"She specified that I take her to the big gate of the market, when I picked her up from the coach," began telling her.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He added that the woman said absolutely nothing, and as a result, he was no longer curious to ask her anything.
Until the destination, we didn't talk, because I was nervous that he put my carcass in the car.
And when he took the bags out of the car, I noticed it smells even worse.
She took the bags out of the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I went two feet back to turn around, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and I moved the car over and over to make the smell go away.
At the bus, I didn't notice if someone helped her lower the bags, because we had lights in the back and we didn't see well in the mirrors.
"There were two bags of plastic and one of rafie," the man completed.
Seeing the woman's strange behavior, he says his curiosity has begun to overwhelm him.
In my mind, I realized something was wrong.
After he took his bags off, I went to the hospital to City Hall, and when I came back, I looked specifically to check on the woman with the luggage.
She had dragged the luggage behind the fence, where the bins inside the market are.
Then I left again.
There was a bit of excitement, as a minibus of Italy and a coach arrived.
I've seen how the woman went to their drivers to get in them, to disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take her, because they have international races, and they don't take passengers on occasions.
The woman was very nervous, walking around.
At one point, the woman entered Peco and, out of curiosity, I asked an employee outside what she did inside.
The employee replied that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because I'd seen it a while ago.
I looked for them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and told them there was something suspicious.
"Then we went somewhere else, a race to Belcești," added Mihai.
He also told us that the woman had become agitated after leaving her luggage in the dumpsters.
With me, the suspicion went away from the fact that his luggage was gone, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and pointed at me, telling her that I warned her she had a suspicious luggage.
Then the woman went to the dumpsters and showed them her luggage.
"I went back to the place where he hid the bags around 3 o'clock, when I gave statements to the police and prosecutors on the spot," the cabbie concluded.
Prosecutors in Neamt, who investigate the case, say that the 64-year-old teacher, Ana Zechariah, was surprised by the cameras of a gas station in Roman at 0.55, getting up with the three bags in the bus.
She arrived at Fair Charming at 1:30.
According to investigators, she would have killed her husband, whom she had been married to for four years, with a knife, and then cut him in the house.
The man's name was Gheorghe Zechariah, and he was a retired officer.
On Sunday evening, the woman put the body parts in two plastic bags, which she transported to the bus station, and hid.
The other night, he transported another one, then decided which direction to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iasi.
Last night, prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid the husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
But the head was found wrapped in newspapers and bags, in a closet in the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, prosecutors didn't learn from the woman who was the reason she killed her husband in such cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the teacher will be mentally experienced, and the body will be examined by forensics to officially determine the cause of death and any other relevant details.
The city took over the national roads from the municipality area, after years ago they had been taken over by the Government, in order to be paved with money from the national budget, during the 2004 electoral campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL), and in order to be able to apply a decision of the Government.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a constraint because this in the knowledge to give the opinion for the General Money Ur Plan (PUG).
The city took over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any event, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 obliged the municipality to take over the national roads transiting through the municipality.
No opinion can be issued from the National Roads if the law is not respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
National roads have passed into our administration since today.
"Of course, the government decision will also have to be issued as a result of this decision by the Local Council," interim mayor Mihai Chirica said.
The national roads that transcribe the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
28 straşul straşul on the arteries: Păcurari Road, Munteni Street (la mafor), Fire Mill, Silvestru Street, Silvestru Street, Nicolae Iorga Street, Spring Avenue, Calea Chișinău, Ţutora Road until the exit from the municipality to Tomești - Albița.
The other national road, DN 24, includes Bucium Road, Socola Avenue (up to the traffic light), Bucium Street (up to Base 3), Calea Chișinău, Tudor Vladimirescu Avenue, C.A. Rosetti Avenue and the exit to Hook-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Following the description of some tabs from the "directory" of Mircea Eliade's political sympathies of youth, which, however condensed they may be, exceed the size of a daily article and must be broadcast in the series, deserves, I think, evoked the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most vehement counts used by the detractors of the great Romanian scientist.
A less humorous description would, I hope, be useful in the real debate that the recent law, called "antilegionary", would be appropriate to stir it up in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Critically analyzing the various versions that spoke of Eliade's regigitation in the Legion through the Axis Nest and Radu Gyr, Florin Turcanu brings it up in the Mircea Eliade volume.
The prisoner of history (Bucharest, 2003), another hypothesis, which interests us to the highest degree in understanding the resumption of epistollary contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after playing Ceausescu "the stage of the balcony" in August that year.
Based on documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the safety investigation, in 1941, documents kept today in the SRI archive (FD, Case 573, f.15) as well as on a follow-up note in 1938, Florin Turcanu states that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in the so-called "Leonary Family" called Luminita, a group of "cloves" by intellectuals, especially writers, led by poet Radu Gyr".
As regards Luminita's nest there are no verifiable data, those in exile considering the existence of this questionable "legionary family", what needs to be discussed is, after all, the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
Leaving aside the surprising courtesy of the SRI to make available these secret files to Mr Turcanu, it is more than obvious that, at the time, the aim of the pursuit of Safety was "commander" Radu Gyr, Eliade's mention being made, according to the note of 21 March 1938, in the context that Armand Călinescu, the Minister of Interior had been given a free hand to take all the necessary steps so that King Charles could impose the Royal Dictator, suspending his parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of the legionaries who were beginning to enjoy unexpected popularity (The All-for-Country Party had emerged third in the 1937 elections).
Eliade's arrest was made as a result of this note, quoted by Turcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, joined the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under the leadership of Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a thin bureaucratic cover for the crackdown of 1938, and it is likely that such superficial notes were made at speed for the vast majority of legionaries or sympathizers active in the public space who needed to be arrested, but who needed to be tied to an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's above-mentioned ollograph statement, given in custody in February 1941, after the suppression of the legionary rebellion, only confirms in retrospect the first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police regime, authoritarian.
It would have been interesting if Turcanu had provided more details about the contents of the quoted 573 file.
Was that Eliade's file or Radu Gyr's?
Because anyway it has to be a file built on the basis of Safety documents, but then processed by Security to be used either against one or against the other.
There is an equivocal here, as in the case of the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only one who knows the composition of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that it represents a pre-trial stage in which the one in question behaves as an active sympathizer, during the three-year trial period before becoming a "camerado" with fine acts.
Also, all these secondary forms of organization, such as intellectual clubs or censorships, sitters, discussion groups with peasants, youth organizations or students, revolved around a nest, were his "family", were not the nest itself, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuances escape completely to the unsuspected lecturer, making Eliade's "member" status (which can be plausible) understood and used ad literam to designate political regulation in the nest.
Of course, the invocation of subtleties of interpretation of this kind cannot occultize the public activity of supporting the Guard or the clear sympathy for the Captain who animated Eliade in 1935-1940, whether in the wake of Nae Ionescu or not.
Public support for a cause in which you believe does not necessarily mean political regulation, however, all the more so since, as a rule, intellectuals of this scale preserve a type of superiority over activists as such and do not enter politics unless they are offered directly high privileges.
As much as I could form an opinion about Eliade's type of thinking from that time when he was the leader of the younger generation, I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchical rigors in a legionary nest.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, though!
Not to mention, only in passing, the fact that in any legionary "directory", what comes first is the anti-Semitic public activity as well as the violence, both worthy of being stigmatized, but nonexistent in Eliade's case, until further evidence.
As for Eliade-Gyr's correspondence between 1968 and 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic defender of Eliade, tries to sanction Florin Turcanu's claims (although based on archive documents, even if they were worth dissecting and contextualizing more seriously) with a questionable argument.
Mircea Handoca notes, in the volume Noi Glosse on Mircea Eliade (Bucharest, 2006), that "no line of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr contains any hint of this assignment".
There was no way that in 1968, when Radu Gyr, somehow, came out of the communist chambers, could not have risked any hint in a letter that was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think he wanted to point out to Mircea Handoca is that the tone of these letters that Radu Gyr sent was a respectful one, of admiration and affection without any doubt about Eliade's ascension.
There is really no such thing as the palest suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been Eliade's boss.
Smart, the poet forced to write at the Voice of Motherland, reveals from the very beginning his embarrassing condition by signaling Eliade (who knew very precisely what mission the publication that had been constantly dealing with the denigration of right-wing exile) in signature, after "your old friend", what to expect and is visibly relieved and happy when he responds affectionately after almost three decades of separation since the "stricken time" alienated them.
There is no doubt that, beyond the "mission" with which he had been tasked (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could come back at least to see his mother and friends again) and that, skillfully, he also fulfills through short sentences, separated by paragraphs, to suggest their character as a foreign body, Radu Gyr only shows interest in literature.
There is no esoteric innuendo, of refined political complications suggested or of any evocation of the years of youth in a register other than the cultural one.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior on Eliade's legionary line, but until the consolidation of this version with less circumstantial evidence than those offered by Florin Turcanu, we have in this correspondence shards of memory that testify to a mutual appreciation of characters who have marked differently, but steadfastly, our culture and who, beyond the dire attempts of life, find the tone of civilization and interwar education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not?, illustrating for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the "under the weather" destiny of the authors.
In the early 1970s, Eliade finally gave up refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext of health problems and catastrophic floods in the country, announced the RSR authorities, through the embassy (with which he wore a sporadic correspondence used to obtain passport for his sister), that he could not follow the invitation to return to the country.
The result was predictable: it is again placed at the index, it is mounted in Israel "The Toladot affair", the books sent to family and friends (Fragments d'un journal, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, never sees its mother again.
Of the friends in the country only Noica has a sporadic correspondence, although surprisingly, as the personal archive in Chicago attests, a lot of individuals or Romanian institutions still manage to send messages.
Clearly why Radu Gyr didn't get permission to write to him after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceaușescu regime tried Eliade's second convincing operation (through official invitations, Noica's actions, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed into eternity.
New coach, foreign players
Due to the shortage of local volleyball players, Penicillina Iași tests in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Exit participates in training tournaments under coach Dan Gavril
Retrograded in the first half of the year from the A1 Women's Volleyball Division, Penicillina Iași retained her place in the first echelon due to the withdrawal and then the disbandment of the Science Miroslava band, recently promoted to the first echelon following a barrage tournament in the very village of Iasi.
The news took a little unprepared leadership of the group of Iese, who found himself left without the main coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, who was second-in-command to Bacău Science) and many missing players, some withdrawn like Cristina Lungu and the freeman Diana Studineanu, or gone, like Ana-Maria Berdila (at the champion of Alba Blaj Volley) and the sisters Maria and Iuliana Fica.
Of course, until the start of the championship scheduled for October 10th, there was still time to complete the series.
First, a new coach was found in the person of Dan Gavril, who came from the men's team LPS Piatra Neamt and who worked briefly in Penicillina in recent years, and soon wet to sign a contract with the group led by Vasile Left.
Then two players from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconita were brought in, and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland were tried, closer to the transfer being Serbian player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Penicillina squad led by Dan Gavril conducted a training camp at Gura Humorului, after which he participated in a tournament held in Lugoj and equipped with the Banat Cup, in which the exits achieved a victory (3-0 with the University of Cluj), but also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, from 23 to 25 September, Penicillina will participate in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship we're trying to put together a valuable team.
We have a skilled and experienced coach, but the Romanian player fund is quite small and that is why we will also turn to volleyball players from abroad, especially after it has been decided that teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of sports at clubs in Romania.
"We hope to reach the end of the competition in 5-6th place, even if it will be very difficult," said Vasile Left, president of ACS Penicillina Iași.
Exciting meeting.
Twins Reunited After Almost 70 Years
Gemini George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, 69, were born at the end of World War II in Germany, after their Polish mother had just been released from a labor camp.
As she was too ill to care for them, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, so the two brothers were separated not only from the one who gave them life, but from each other.
Tens of years George and Lucian didn't know about each other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered documents demonstrating that he was adopted and had a brother.
In the 1960s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they found no trace to lead them to Lucian.
Only in 2015, thanks to the Red Cross's "Restoring Family Links" program, the twins met again, and the moment was more than touching.
BBC reporters have captured this episode.
Ten children from Iasi brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal, were won by the children of Iezeni at the German Open Championship in Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organised by the German Sports Dance Federation and the World Sports Dance Federation.
From Iași there were five pairs who trained at the Dance Energy Club and danced with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 children from Iasi participated in five different categories (juveniles 1, juvenile 2, junior 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with medals were the pairs: Răzvan Andrei Zechariah and Ana Maria Târzianu (two gold and one silver medals), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Ștefana Gologan (the bronze medal).
And three other pairs managed to take the lead: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Ioana Josub Cujbă and last but not least Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ioniță.
As a coach, I really wanted to reconfirm the results achieved in March this year, and this reconfirmation was needed for us as teachers and for athletes, in terms of their future evolution.
The fact that we managed to hear the Romanian anthem twice this year at the German Open and return home with four medals, gives us enormous joy and hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to the highest level.
"All of this would only be possible with some important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," said Andreea Ramona Manolache, coach of the Dance Energy Club's children.
Romania was represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, achieving a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country as 4th place of the 20 participating countries.
It should be mentioned that out of the nine medals, four came to Iasi.
6 Ways to Get Out of Stress in One Minute
Too few of us can afford to run a weekend to the mountains to relieve stress.
Some take our time, others our finances, and others both.
But there are solutions available to anyone who wants to relieve a little stress.
They did not involve any high costs or special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
Everyday worries are inevitable, but it's up to us how we deal with them and what attitude we take towards them.
Instead of grinding you inside and feeling an implosion taking place in your mind, you better try the following relaxation tactics that won't steal more than a minute.
Take a deep breath.
Breathing exercises are not just intended for soloists or yoga practitioners.
They work for any individual, and regulating breathing at a tense moment helps release endorphins into the body, which leads to a state of relaxation, informs Livestrong.
Be a child.
We know we're over our childhood age and we can't afford to pet each other when we feel like it.
But that doesn't mean we can't go to a corner of office headquarters or wherever we know we're alone (even behind the building) and not scream while our lungs are holding.
You can get rid of the nerves and the negative energy accumulated over the course of a day with a few big screams.
Imagine a beautiful place.
We know the recommendation sounds worthy of a replica from a psychotherapy session, but not for nothing psychologists often use it.
Imagination of a beautiful place, which inspires us calmly and detached from daily frenzy, can lead to alleviation of the state of nerves.
It is, indeed, self-suggestion, a process that can actually change lives, both for the better and for the worse.
It all depends on what we're suggesting.
It is best to think of an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to the music
Put your headphones in your ears and listen to the relaxing music.
Attention, this is not about your favorite music, because if it is about heavy metal you may encounter difficulties in relaxing.
Listen to even relaxing songs, which are smooth and do not contain lyrics, to find your balance when your fuse is lit.
Peel an orange
Does the advice to peel an orange to the nerves sound strange?
Well, it's not!
Because it is not the fruit itself, because it does not contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (occasional, too total).
It's about aromatherapy!
The smell of the orange peel, during peeling, stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, hormone of the state of well-being.
He caresses an animal.
Those who have animals close by, whether it's the one at home, or it's the one who came around the workplace, take a few seconds to caress him.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, petting animals can lower blood pressure.
Hora and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with somewhat rival instruments, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces of Romanian folklore combining violin with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is entitled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found each other, and from that moment on it gave us great pleasure to sing together, having a virtually unlimited repertoire".
We thought this was the moment a violin met with a guitar.
Cristi: "From the first meeting we realized that it is very good to hear what we sing and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work."
Each of us has learned on the move from each other's repertoire, and what's very important is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there is a chasm between classical music people and the rest".
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And secondly, we steal a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make those who only listen to classical music listen and rock, and those who listen to rock only get to like classical music.
And we had the surprise of being told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they would listen to something like this and they would love it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, we find it formidable".
Students from Iași stayed in traffic longer than at school the first day after vacation
Hundreds of Jesuits were "captive" in infernal traffic in several areas yesterday morning.
The town hall announced that Mangeron Boulevard (splai Bahlui left bank) is closing today, between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș.
The mayors have not kept their promises to do some work to smooth traffic with the beginning of the school year.
One of the assurances that the municipality has provided, at least twice in recent weeks, has been to re-establish the roundabout in the International Station area.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be fitted, and the last deadline was the end of last week, yesterday the roundabout was not completed.
Drivers' nerves were stretched to the max on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, as another promise of the City Hall was violated: moving customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Technopolis "at the latest by the end of August", as this transfer has been discussed since 2012.
Currently, interim mayor Mihai Chirica says the problem at International Station is more complicated.
Giratia will be done at the right time, we have to take into account the tram movement in the area, we also need an opinion from National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where there's time for the tram to stay in the roundabout, but we'll sort it out somehow," said Chirica.
One of the solutions, according to him, would be stopping the tram with a traffic light before the turn.
Problems in circulation were also in the intersection of Red Podu.
The car line on Saint Lazarus Street stretched to the SRI headquarters.
"I waited good minutes to be able to go out in Red Podu," said one Jeshean.
Through Podu Roș they had to move trams to CUG in September, if the rehabilitation project "Development and functional artery rehabilitation South" was completed within the original execution deadline (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complete the original one.
"We have attracted European funds for new works, for example overexpansion, on the original version the passage of Nicolina was narrow," Chirica commented.
The most recent deadline for the re-entry of trams is October.
During yesterday, the people reported traffic problems especially in areas such as Păcurari, Centru (Cucu Fair, Independence, Armenian Street) or the intersection of Base 3.
The lord could return as head of CJ.
In the course of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The Judges of the General Court will decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the County Council will be maintained in judicial review and prohibitions.
Yesterday the magistrates of the Iași Tribunal settled a new term in the case "Album", in which the defendant is also the suspended president of the Iași County Council.
At the end of yesterday's hearing, the magistrates decided to rule later tomorrow on the measure of judicial control currently imposed against Adomniţa.
The latter wishes to live or revoke this measure, which has kept him away from the chair of head of the CJ for several months.
In case of a favorable solution, and if it is not mentioned by the superior court, Cristian Adomniței will be able to resume his position as president of the CJ.
Adomniţa was sent to trial by the National Antico ruption Directorate (DNA), accused of favoring the perpetrator and false intellectual after, I say procurio, he attempted to mask an audit check that revealed a number of irregularities regarding the reception in a public counter-conct between CJ and Laser Co.
Adomniţa would have tried to hide the fact that the institution he led would not have received more materials to promote the county of Iași, although these materials were written as being received by CJ.
Alongside him, three CJ directors were also brought to justice, as well as the manager of Laser Co.
Another 3,500 people are expected to vote on September 25th.
The city is prepared to distribute further questionnaires if the 12,000 will be exhausted.
The Jeşeni have only ten days to express their opinion on replanting the tei on the pedestrian Stefan cel Mare.
According to the municipality officials, some 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed at the district centers and in three additional points in the city (Copou Park, Alexandru cel Bun Esplanada and City Hall) have been completed so far.
A record number of Jesuits appeared in front of the City Hall on Sunday.
According to representatives of the civic group "Iaşul loves teii", 530 Iaşeni voted in 140 minutes, and almost four votes cast every minute.
On the other hand, about 440 people came to the same place throughout the Monday.
The group's volunteers say that many outcasts are calling for inefficient public consultation signals and populations.
They therefore called on internet users yesterday to print an information poster made available by the group and to stick it in the stairs to the block.
The volunteers also showed that at the additional point in Copou Park the last forms were filled out by Iasi on Sunday.
We'll provide forms from the neighborhood centers, where they don't really add up.
"Possibly supplements will be made when all 12,000 forms are filled out," municipality spokesman Sebastian Buraga said yesterday.
"Scruti nul teilor" will end on 25 September, and if the majority vote of the Iașins is in favour of replanting the trees, then the City Hall will plant silver limes this autumn.
The Jeşeni can express their opinion at the neighbourhood centers of Dacia, Frumoasa, Tătătasi, Nicolina and Păcurari, as well as at the additional points mentioned above.
The mayors decided to cut the poles on Stephen the Great in early 2013, which attracted a fine of 60,000 lei to the municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without a consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous emergence of the civic group "Iaşul loves the teii", an online community comprising about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for replanting tei was signed, until last night, by over 9,100 supporters.
RECORD of students registered at USAMV Iasi!
I'm 920 in my first year.
This year the university has 920 students in the first year.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" said that this year there have been most candidates admitted, in the history of the higher education institution, since the establishment.
We are very pleased with this year's results from admission.
We have the largest number of admitted candidates in the history of the university, almost 920 students in the first year.
"We also had candidates with higher backgrounds, we took our seats from budget to license and master," said Prof.dr. Ioan Țenu, vice-rector in charge of teaching.
He also noted that the university also registered a considerable number of students at the tax, occupying 20% of the seats, a significantly higher figure than in other years.
Although the results of the study lines in Romanian have been published, the admission still continues to the English language study program at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which has taken out 50 seats, where the fee is 5,000 euros, and now is expected to be answered by the ministry regarding the confirmation of student files and necessary study visas.
At the autumn session, a total of 120 files were submitted on the 14 budgeted seats and 209 were submitted to the "tax" contest at the bachelor's studies.
Most of the files were submitted to the Faculty of Agriculture, in number 75, at Horticulture were 23, and at Zootehnie, 22.
The master's degree was submitted in the autumn session 18 files, on the 150 seats on the fee proposed by USAMV, seven of them in Agriculture, five in Horticulture and six in Zootehnie.
Drivers are afraid of entering the cracks on Tudor Vladimirescu Bridge with the wheels of cars
The bridge over Bahlui on Tudor Vladimirescu Boulevard remained as riddled as when "The Paper of Iași" wrote about the problems it presents 10 days ago.
Reporters of our daily report that on the axis that delineates the two walks the asphalt has dropped, defending deep pits, some even 20 centimetres, through which you can see the concrete slabs that represent the primary infrastructure of the bridge.
Also, the asphalt began to crack on either side of the shaft, indicating signs that the dents would increase.
At the time, interim mayor Mihai Chirica said that the bridge has no structural problems, being recently made a technical expertise, in order to start a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tram rail, worth 5 million euros.
Mayor Chirica said that the area affected by cracks and pits will be signaled, and asphalt restoration works will be carried out quickly.
However, the only measures taken so far have been the mounting of pins and a signal band, without even a simple filling.
During this period, we focused more on the opening of the school and the work needed for this purpose.
"A punctual expertise for the bridge is under way that we expect in about a week with the details necessary for the intervention, I appreciate that within two weeks at most we could move on to remedy the situation," the interim mayor said.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The preparatory class, as it tries to improve the situation.
I don't know whether to enjoy or be overwhelmed by melancholy; I am inclined, passively, towards the second option.
First of all, because I feel like it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took him for the first time, nervously, to kindergarten.
Although he is relieved, no normal parent rejoices to raise his children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day from my childhood; then a story began that, as a matter of fact, has not yet ended.
I wasn't exactly what's usually called a conscientious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But the school always liked me.
So much so that I chose to continue to attend it, even as a teacher.
When I decided this was what I wanted to do my whole life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And none with any stake.
That's because, like every one of us, I've come across all kinds of teachers: better or worse, nicer or unbearable, smarter or really stupid.
Unfortunately, there are people with other calls in this guild.
I think they're toxic, because they damage the enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form.
I was lucky to give, as I was a student or student, over a few, few, exceptional teachers.
These meetings can be decisive if they happen at the right time.
Who thinks that the role of the department is the banal transmission of some information is wrong.
This can be done by anyone; to inform, the student can inform himself very well that we are only living in the era of transparency.
A good teacher, however, shapes the minds of alumni.
It makes them, it makes them think.
Sitting in the chair is not a privilege, as many believe, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very picky, demanding, unforgiving and always willing to look for the problems of those in front of them.
That's how age dictates their temper.
As a teenager, we all thought we knew everything, that we had absolute certainty about everything.
When we grow up, we come to understand that we have nothing but doubts.
Therefore, the role of a teacher is to remove the adolescent from his self-sufficiency and make him think.
I mean, learn to doubt, to ask questions.
To discover on their own the answers, even the provisional ones.
To get involved in everything he does.
To lead him discreetly to profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially since most of the time the student believes that the teacher is his enemy.
One who can't wait to catch him on the wrong foot to sanction him.
However, this justifies him, the one who is always misunderstood, rebellious, who owes a lot of time to live up to his age calls, to look at the one in the department with suspicion.
It's just that he can't accept naturally his attempt to order it.
Adolescents shall not be allowed to work out, do not accept restrictions.
Or if they feel like they're doing it, they're getting revenge somehow.
And unfortunately, when there is a rigid person in the department, who imposes himself through hardness and does not communicate, the students take revenge on the object taught.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with great writers, for example, because of the lack of tact of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who think that history is a collection of data, that mathematics are the most exhausting for their unripe minds.
I always urge my students: if you find a teacher that you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate with you from man to man, don't let him push you away from the literature that he should direct you to.
How did it happen that I became the teacher myself?
I had a really good teacher in VI-VIII.
He has opened my mind to some texts that have spoken to the puberty since then in his own understanding.
I met a professor in high school who opened the door to his library.
I looked at him as a man from another world: he had the walls of his house covered with bookshelves.
I'd get lost in his library and dream about having one of my own.
I may have it now, but if fate hadn't put it in my way, maybe I'd have decided to become a football player.
Or an engineer or a lawyer or whatever.
I don't think dating like this is random.
I don't believe in chance.
The main thing is to come across the man who takes your hand and patiently directs you to your own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the teacher.
Now, my experience only helps me talk about what it means to teach literature.
It's just that literature can't teach.
There is no such thing as a professor of literature, as there is a teacher of mathematics.
How to fix the ineffable in concepts?
You can, at most, approximate it, without pretending to transmit petrified truths.
The one at the department can guide the reading at best, that's something else.
But especially can occasion some miraculous encounters between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the person in the bank.
There are meetings that can open his mind, that can lift someone's voice, scales off his eyes.
Therefore, the literature teacher must first manage to make his students understand (feel) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great coseur, Al. Paleologu, said one thing only apparently paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not the other way around!" and he was right.
That's why a good teacher prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open field anyway.
Fortunately, there's always something to learn.
And we, the teachers; or especially us, the teachers.
Most of the time, a great truth is repeated only from inertia: not only do the disciples have to learn from their masters, but also vice versa.
Ideally, the teacher should be a master and the student an apprentice.
Who, like every valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
Few find him, that's right.
But it was the master who lit the spark.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a pure-blooded teacher than to endure as many of these breakups as possible.

Extending investigation to FIFA
Justice in the United States and Switzerland will proceed to new arrests
US and Swiss authorities have announced that new individuals and organisations will be prosecuted as part of the investigation into corruption in FIFA, international media reports.
US Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced at a press conference in Zurich on Monday that the scope of investigations into corruption in world football was widened.
"On the basis of our co-operation and on the basis of new evidence, we will commit additional prosecutions against new individuals and organisations," Lynch said.
In May, several senior FIFA officials were arrested in Switzerland in the case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extradited to the United States.
"We have hopes that other people will also be prosecuted in the US," Lynch added.
Switzerland's Attorney General Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, said his institution had seized several assets, including homes and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the investigation carried out in collaboration with the US.
"We haven't even reached the end of the first half," Lauber said.
So far, a huge amount of information, 11 terrabytes, has been confiscated.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are being investigated.
An agreement to cede media rights to the 2010 World Cups in South Africa and in 2014 - Brazil has also entered the investigators' attention.
FIFA faces a big corruption scandal after US justice has indicted 14 people, including two FIFA vice-presidents and seven forum officials.
Retained persons are being investigated for bribery and other benefits, from the early 1990s to the present, totalling over $150 million.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced in early July that he was resigning as FIFA president after being re-elected for the fifth time.
♪ Fightin' like a movie at the theater ♪
In the Supekombat gala in Milan, Isajan Cătălin Morosanu will fight "the beast" James Wilson
A number of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Cătălin Morosanu, will participate in the Superkombat Gala at the Linear 4 Ciak Theatre in Milan, the last before the November finals, on October 2nd, according to a press release by MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by last year's atmosphere, and as promised, we will return this autumn with a new five-star gala.
Since we have chosen a unique venue, a theatre, then we promise to fight like in the movies.
We will have eight Romanian fighters in the event program.
In addition to the matches with the established stars, we will have another opening gala, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including Romanians Cristi Spetcu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"The full programme will soon be announced," said promoter Eduard Irimia.
Cătălin Morosanu will fight at the Superkombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination Gala with the American James Wilson, known after participating in the last pyramid in Japan's heavyweight category in 2012 and numerous awards from the bodybuilding concusses.
I can't wait to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, he's really a beast, but I'm demolishing him!
I'm still upset that last year I couldn't fight in the finals, so now I'm gonna get back at him.
"From the beast I turn it into a kitten," said Moroshanu.
Undefeated in 2015, brothers Andrei and Bogdan Stoica will have the final confrontations in Italy before fighting for the world titles on November 7 in the grand final.
Last year, both of them knocked themselves out in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.
I'm happy to go back to Italy, last year's atmosphere was incredible.
"I can't wait to meet the fans there again and I promise them a new show to remember," World Champion Andrei Stoica said.
In Milan, Raul Cătinaș will also fight against an opponent to be established.
A little girl invited the Queen of England to her birthday, but she also scolded her in the letter.
A little girl from Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen on her longest reign, but did not forget to mention that she was not allowed into Buckingham Palace when she went to visit him with her family.
The letter did not run out of echo, but the little girl received a reply from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for the invitation, but also apologized that she could not be present on September 27, and even wished her to have fun with her family and friends.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Paunescu were invited together to a talk show shortly before the poet Adrian Paunescu died.
Both writers died of a heart attack.
The destiny of Adrian Paunescu and Vadim Tudor is similar.
Both were writers and politicians and both died at close ages of heart.
Adrian Paunescu at 67, Vadim Tudor at 65.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Paunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Paunescu died, on a show of Realitatea TV.
Vadim Tudor, full of vervature, taunted Gheorghe Flutur and criticized Elena Udrea, the minister of tourism at the time, for the Romanian tourism situation.
At one point, Vadim Tudor said, with a smile on the jokes, to Adrian Paunescu, "I am envious of your posthumous glory, Adrian."
Peacock, smiling too, said to him then, "It's not very laudative what you just said to me."
Adrian Paunescu died on 5 November 2010, at the age of 67.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died today, 14 September 2015, at the age of 65.

A Syrian artist turned Super Mario into a refugee
A Syrian artist created a refugee version of the popular game "Super Mario", evoke the difficult situation of his compatriots on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of Italian plumber Mario in the Kingdom of Mushrooms, the modified video game is centered on the "Mario Refugee".
The character tries to get past human traffickers and border police on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The Istanbul-based artist uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mufti for security reasons and said he made the video game with the refugee Mario after his friends ventured on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of war.
At Craiova Detention Center the youngest student is 15 years old and is in first class
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Center, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in the first grade and the oldest is 25 years old and is in the 11th grade, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a center belonging to the National Administration of Penitentiaries to try to draw attention, and in this way, to some less known realities.
The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in the first class, and the oldest is 25 years old and is enrolled in the 11th grade.
"There are complicated topics that society is concerned about debating at this point, we are all pressed by our own worries and problems, but we must not overlook the lesson that these over 100 young people in the Craiova Detention Centre offer," Minister Robert Cazanciuc said at the opening ceremony of the school year on Monday.
The Minister of Justice pointed out that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of material possibilities, can lead to tragedies, stating that the young people in this centre would have had another chance in life if they could have taken the natural course of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to find out what it means to observe the law and what consequences it may have.
"The role of the prison system is not to permanently isolate from society people who have broken the law, to close them behind high walls, but to try to re-educate and prepare them, so that when they return to the community they have more chances of reintegration," Cazanciuc added.
The minister made it clear that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investments must also be made in the prison system, because in many cases detention conditions are borderline humane and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and thanks to this partnership, every year, in the prison system, there are over 2000 graduates of school courses.
Obviously, we won't be able to change overnight that hasn't been 25 years, but these are important steps that we're taking.
"In all these steps we also need the support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our job, that through your work these young people have a chance and do not pose a danger to society," Cazanciuc said.
The Minister of Justice wished both students and educators success, showing that success comes only through the combined effort of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the Ascension of the Holy Cross, I would launch to all students and teachers the invitation to visit the mausoleums of Soveja, Mărăsti and not only, to understand what the struggle of young people means for ideals," Robert Cazanciuc said.
A Russian came to the vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarism to be disbanded!
Petition of prestigious academics from Iasi and country
Over 200 researchers, academics, personalities and students from the country signed a petition launched by the Romanian Academic Society in which they request the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even abolish the doctoral schools in Romania "which allow and promote academic imposture".
Signers of the petition launched on 10 September include teachers and teachers from Iasi.
Among the university signatories of the petition in the academic environment is, for example, Prof.Dr. Liviu Antonesei.
At national level, the petition has names from former education ministers such as Mircea Miclea, to people of culture who are also academics, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Education Law provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been achieved so far, thus causing the lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools that flagrantly violate ethical norms in scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance," the petition initiated.
The petition specifically requires compliance with the Law on National Education, evaluation of doctoral schools, suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school where more than two plagiarisms were found, until the assessment and remedy of the situation.
The last requirement is the suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school where there is no minimum number of doctoral leaders required by law to meet the criteria imposed by the National Council of Scientific Research in 2011 for eligibility to projects of IDEI type.
Do you respect less a general without a PhD, or a politician, or an intelligence agent in the Middle East?
"Why is it that there are no other academies in Europe to give PhDs organized by secret services, and the top military who give their doctorate do it to autonomous academic institutions, where the quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academic Society, initiator of the petition, also from Iași.
This can be complemented by all the willing on the Society’s website, and the final signatures will be submitted by the organization to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "For Iași" party, founded by young managers from politically unrelated IT, was launched the day before yesterday in Copou Park.
The president of the Initiative Group "For Iași" gave an interview "The Paper of Iași"
The Iasi will have a party dedicated exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of non-political entrepreneurs and managers has so far launched the For Iași Party at the end of last week which will propose candidates for local elections in 2016.
Currently, the core of the party is made up of IT specialists, but initiators say that all people who want to get involved in the modernization of the city are welcome in the organization.
The launch took place on Saturday, in Copou Park, and more than 200 sympathisers attended the event, almost all of them young.
The special guest of the action was Nicușor Dan, president of Save Bucharest Association.
He was the surprise of the 2012 local elections, when, from his independent position, he managed to gather 10% of the votes of Bucharest residents for the mayor of the capital.
"The people I've seen at "For Iași" think they're very good at getting into the public administration of Iași."
I believe in this initiative, I think it has chances, I think it has maybe more chances in a community smaller than in Bucharest.
"I will always be there for "For Iași," Nicuşor Dan said.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iasi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are rather sentimental and emotional.
I was away on many short business trips, I lived in Cluj for a year.
I came back every time, because I felt like this was my home.
ZDI: Why have you now decided to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache:Now we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have known each other for some time.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we got more shy, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various edilite or charitable actions, and somehow, things have evolved naturally and organically, and now it has happened to be the moment when we have come to the decision that we need to get more involved than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects to make local public administration more efficient!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimum computerization of the city's activity so that the different departments, institutions and kings can cooperate as well.
But more importantly, it can publish transparent data about the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about informational organization.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a certain neighborhood, it is important to consult the public of the affected people.
If we are talking efficiency, we must not forget public transport, we have the worst buses in the country.
New means of transport must be purchased.
ZDI: Nowadays, the image of a city matters extremely much.
How would you promote the coward?
Andrei Postolache: Get on the plane and look for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industry events where you can "sell" the city.
You have to want to do this and know how to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Iasi.
ZDI: What is the brand of Iasi?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we have to be a city of technology, one way or another.
We already have the IT industry, and we need to expand it, go to medicine, get into the robotics area, into the 3D printing area, continue in this spirit and unite such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I mean here the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Iasi already has a historical brand that must not be changed, namely by the cultural city.
I see the two elements in the balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures with which elections are still being won in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organization, planning, communication, working with people and carrying out projects.
We have management experience.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we'll talk to everyone, we won't just stay on Facebook, we're not an online party.
We don't want to have "volunteers" brought in by bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there are enough people like that.
ZDI: Should the Mayor of Iasi be more concerned with promoting the city’s image at national and international level, or should the area of concern always be of an edilitarian nature?
Andrei Postolache: One without another does not work.
First you have to solve today's problems, the emergencies.
Or, if you don't make your city known, if you don't attract money to the city, at some point you run out of money and you won't be able to make streets, for example.
You have to do both at the same time and you have competent people next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the model of the mayor-dad, who comes and beats with the mass punch and solves everything.
No.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract to the party businessmen from the IT area who can financially support the party?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, to have an unstained reputation, to be clear integrity and to be honorable.
From this point of view, we don't have any other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or, why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has worked in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015 he founded Introspecials, after for seven years he was director of the International Endava Concern (2008-2015), where he coordinated a team of 300 people.
Another four years (2003 – 2007) he spent at Synygy.
The company he set up with another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
Tractor Rabla Program proved a failure
General Director of SC IRUM SA Reghin Mircea Oltean said the programme to stimulate the renewal of the national tractor and agricultural machinery fleet, initiated in 2011, also known as the Tractor Rabla, was a failure due to bureaucracy.
With regard to the Rabla Program, there have been some attempts in recent years, but it turned out to have been a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a common farmer, and the approvals were far too long, and that's when the world gave up.
Through that program it was managed to sell somewhere at 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," Mircea Oltean said.
According to him, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually, being the largest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by foreign companies, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
There is a great deal of competition with those who come from outside, all the world producers have their eyes on Romania, they know these things that I have told you, and they have special policies.
"At all the fairs there is a great crowd, all the producers exhibit, they come with all sorts of variants," said Mircea Oltean, who said that IRUM Reghin produces about 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors annually.
Through the Rabla program for tractors, initiated in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as combinations, could hand them over and receive instead a voucher of 17,000 lei.
The red flag has gone up
The internal Labour Scrutiny seems more spectacular and politically significant, as the newly elected leader automatically becomes its spearhead in the upcoming elections.
Raised, therefore, the red-lit flag / Under its folds we will live and die.
That's what Jeremy Corbyn sang yesterday in the London Sanctuary House pub.
He's witnessed a lot of facts and vows. Let's not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial anthem of the British and international left (The Red Flag) can search for it on the Internet and would not be excluded from having a surprise.
With our heads exposed, let's all swear that we'll wear it until we collapse.
The author of these lines is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and those who wave them), but he respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn succeeds in joining yesterday's left and tomorrow's left, this love story between him and the base of the Labour Party will have a happy ending.
I do not believe that this will happen, but it seems premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat, five years from now, of a leader elected the day before yesterday.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have seen an impressive democratic exercise.
It was not the British laborers who invented the system of direct voting for the party leader among the Western left.
French Socialists have been practicing a more complicated motion-based system for several years that allows for the expression of all members and sympathizers; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for the nomination of the presidential candidate since 2012.
However, the internal Labour elections seem more spectacular and politically significant, as the newly elected leader automatically becomes its spearhead in the upcoming elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of political system, with the customisation of power being more pronounced in Britain than on the other side of the English Channel.
In addition, the turnout was high in all three "circles": members of the actual trade unions and other organizations affiliated to the party and, finally, the group of sympathizers (who received the ballot after a summary registration procedure).
This last group gives us interesting information about the perceptions of left-wing segments in British society, especially those made up of young people or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to become even more involved in the future, precisely because of the signal given by Corbin's victory.
There are, as far as I know, sociological investigations that tell us too much about the attitudes of this "outer circle" labor, so cautious speculation is allowed.
I think we find enough attitudes similar to those of Podemos sympathisers (Spain) or even Syriza (Greece), with the observation that they will go through the traditional channels of the left.
If we want to identify an "antisystem" vocation, it is reflected primarily by the rejection of the centrist line, New Labour (for many, only a hidden form of the much-hulite thatcherism).
The second component would be to repudiate the leaders deemed guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one argument being that they did not go to the left sufficiently, that they did not delineate firmly from the Tony Blair era.
The second landmark - even more suggestively, according to me - is offered by the recent referendum on Scotland's independence.
If we disregard the separatist message and focus strictly on aspirations on other political topics, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of public segments favourable to the social state and animated by the aspiration of equity, adept at disarmament and hostile to military involvement abroad, but also sensitive to the new themes of the left: ecology, gender, assistance for poor countries.
The Scottish laborists thus lost a electorate to which they should have, at least in principle, had privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm for Corbin's campaign).
Such energies exist all over the UK, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation as an outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, the Labour "aristocrate".
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the one with the anti-system left on the southern outskirts of Europe.
The term "antisystem" is too harsh: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
By next week, we will learn more about the first steps of Jeremy Corbyn, as the leader of the opposition.
We will see if the Red Flag will also ring in the House of Commons (it would not be the first time) after the new leader has taken his place, primarily of the opposition banks.
However, what Jeremy Corbin now wants from his fellow Members in Parliament is first and foremost unity - and in this regard he does have reason to be concerned.
Handling trap with or without good knowledge
While I wrote the article, it occurred to me to check the story of the former warrior and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" in the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his person "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categorisations - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in itself make me a circumspect start).
I didn't.
In last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") we commented in parallel on two pictures - the one with the little boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the shore of the Mediterranean and the one, in fact: the two depicting Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The Laith Al-Saleh story was taken from the article "Syrian Fighters Coming with the Wave of Refugees" (signed by Viorica Marin in The Truth of September 3rd).
Monday night, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
On Tuesday, going on Facebook, I found, among other things, a pull of the sleeve from my friend Marius Cristian (not only by FB): "I subscribe, only a mention. Laith al Saleh is not a jihadist".
On the contrary, he's a fighter against Al Assad for democracy and all that.
"So you could add rude manipulation to the painting"!
I have to admit, I felt bad.
All the more so since while I wrote the article, it occurred to me to check the story of the former warrior and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" in the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his person "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categorisations - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in itself make me from the start circumspect).
Because I trusted the truth, his journalists.
On the spot, I had no further comment on Marius Cristian's pull of the sleeve than this: "I need it if I (had) confidence in the truth"
After that, I obviously took the story for granted and I feel indebted to readers with the correct presentation of the story of Syrian Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest I found was in an Associated Press material (Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe) signed by Nicholas Bahitis and Dalton Bennett on 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos in Greece, where they noticed, among the hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, a man trying to clean up the chaos of the crowd.
The man was Syrian scholar Laith Al Saleh of Aleppo who "is accustomed to being in command", since he "led a unit of 700 rebels in the Syrian Civil War".
We also learn that Al Saleh, 30, had "a home, a wife and a normal life before the battle began that cost more than 250,000 lives and put a third of Syria's population on the road".
In an interview with correspondents at the Associated Press, Al Saleh tells that "everyone wants to leave Syria".
My city is the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me - I fought against everyone.
Beyond being kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "an even more sinister meeting - with a man in whom he recognized a Syrian enemy": "Two days ago, I saw a sniper from government forces.
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very upset.
From the material we also learn that Laith (meaning lion in Arabic) was indeed on his way to Holland, where he had a cousin - former senior officer in the Syrian army and then became also rebellious and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to obtain asylum and then bring his family - wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly an age with the civil war in Syria, which broke out in March 2011).
After this was achieved, Laith Al-Saleh would not have ruled out a return to Syria to continue the fight for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: President Bashar Assad's army (supported by the Russians), the Islamic State and the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front.
A madness - who wants freedom must fight in Syria against not one enemy, but three!
I also came across a Serbian material on August 22nd, of which I did not understand much, except that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come along with migrants: TERRORISTS KRIJU MIGU MIGRANTIMA calls the headline of a news on http://www.telegraf.rs/vest, in which a picture of Al Saleh with a beard is joined holding a Syrian flag and that of refugee wearing a THANK YOU shirt.
On September 7, then, on the BBC website itself, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulation with the help of photographs of the Syrian fighter: This viral photo falsely Claims to show an IS fighter possessing as a refugee - This viral picture claims wrongly to depict an Islamic State fighter posing as a refugee.
We learn that the picture (in fact: the picture - the one with Laith with the beard and the gun and the one with the THANK YOU shirt) was posted by a user on Facebook, which user would have apologized in the meantime.
Only before that, just from his wall, the image of the two pictures would have been cut over 70,000 times, gathering a few thousand comments.
That word, too late, the horse was gone!
In Romania, on September 9, Carla Dinu from Hotnews takes over the story of manipulation from the BBC, but mistranslates the title: "A fake photo turned viral shows an ISIS fighter posing as a refugee".
Obviously, it's not the photo that's fake, but the interpretation was false, wrong, in short: manipulative.
