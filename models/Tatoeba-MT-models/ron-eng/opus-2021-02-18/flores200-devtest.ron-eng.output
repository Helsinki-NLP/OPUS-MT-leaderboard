USA Gymnastics supports the letter of the US Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sport, can be better served by the implementation of significant changes in our organization than by the withdrawal of certification.

It not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were feathered, an already widespread hypothesis, but provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown-castan in the upper part, with a light color or orange in the lower part.
The discovery also offers a perspective on how birds’ feathers have evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called rahis, but have other characteristic elements of feathers – beards and beards – researchers have concluded that rahish was probably an evolutionary development developed according to the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather to regulate the temperature or to impress. Researchers have suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not chicken fluff.
Researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the fluff of a chicken.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by the tidal forces produced between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction to the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a sort of aura and is composed of a lot of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
"In an interview, he said the new version is "very disturbing and worrying because of the very high mortality rate."
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, says Dr. Moll, and at least 2 were hospital health professionals.
During one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they are in close contact.

“They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behaviour is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but is compatible with the assumption that they would represent deep holes in the soil," Glen Cushind of the Astrogeological Team of the United States Geological Prospection Service (USGS) and North Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona said.
In France, voting has traditionally been a little technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin and insert in an envelope a printed paper in advance indicating which candidate they have chosen.
After officials verify the voter's identity, he leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.

Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers confirm that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and no envelopes are added, except for those of duly counted and authorised voters.
Candidates can send their representatives to witness all stages of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

In the other contest he participated in, the giant slalom finished 10th in the female sitting group, with a total time of 4:41.30, with 2:11.60 minutes after the first arrival, Australian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes after the ninth place contestant, Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four female skiers in position failed to complete their tour, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the giant slalom failed to get a seat in the contest.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
‘Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: ‘We arrested five people who raped the Swiss girl and recovered her cell phone and laptop.’
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the charges appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit her, no one got hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road he had the accident was temporarily closed until emergency services pulled the driver out of the red TT Audi.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She was detained pending prosecution and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered, as her image was widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have decided that publishing photographs can be harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists seem to play with fire by publishing photographs and other information about suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, who is charged with the prosecution, has informed journalists that he will make no further comments at least until the arraignment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants drawn up on the basis of pre-Middle Eastern borders in 1967.
Other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requires that, after signing the agreement, it has a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the AP agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
The hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by the rangers, the test being monitored and its effectiveness under assessment.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Association of Sports Hunters of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited, based on the hunting program of the Association of Sports Hunters.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Executive Director for the Conservation and Heritage of the Park at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training training.
Martelly took an oath yesterday to a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (PEC).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MECI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to devices.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple reported another 34 incidents of overheating, which the company said were «no serious»."
"The ministry replied, saying that the deferral from Apple is "really regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific tsunami alert center said there are no clues to a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists hostage in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and the deaths of at least six have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elders, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographs.
Later, photographs took the place of an elderly woman who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and followed a career in medicine.
He studied obstetrics and began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began in his spare time to investigate premature labor.
His research has shown that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua said government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders Wednesday.
The Wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said that «The moon was the first queen of the extremes. My first manager. The moon died in the night by two months. A unique moment, like she was. A strong woman.»
“Dustin Runnels, nicknamed “Golden Powders”, commented that “The Moon was as eccentric as I was... maybe even more... I love it and I will miss it... I hope it’s in a better place.”
Out of 1,400 people questioned before the 2010 federal elections, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the 2010 campaign for the federal elections, argued that in his view Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign is over.
34% of those interviewed agree with this opinion, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the survey, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medal at the Olympics was to swim at the Commonwealth Games, in 100 m and 200 m free, as well as in three relays, but his physical condition was questioned due to his complaints.
He was unable to take the medication needed to control the pain, which was banned during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number known to date.
Several people checked the discovery before early February, using various combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the earth's water supply, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how the Earth was formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his government earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalise the same-sex marriage.
He referred to rumors as "political chatter and gibberish".
It is speculated that he will run for President in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA states would allow aircraft to travel shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on the use of satellites, unlike older ground radar systems, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and to transmit more accurate information to pilots.
No additional means of transport are available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and parking facilities related to public transport are not available in the area.
Concerns about the lack of means of transport raised the possibility of organizing the game with closed doors, in the absence of team supporters.
A study published in Science magazine on Thursday reported the development of a new bird species on the Galápagos Equadorian Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to the reproduction between Darwin endemic finches, Geospiza fortis, and an immigrant cactus finches, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in a multitude of patterns. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into thin threads that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated in sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued over another metal. It can be made so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "lit manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes colour depending on how acidic or basic (alkalin) is the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
They mix the two powders together, and then, with their hands clean and wet, they form a ball out of them.
The humidity present on your hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange feeling and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Waste from sewage systems was found in homes in Minon cities in Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used in common.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you do this through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge, 100-foot-high rocket to carry a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel gave us was to offer us a much simpler and faster transport.
It brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Underneath them we have several medium-sized cats, feeding on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free pets) that eat many more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche; each cat has its own role to play, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called packs.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similar to wolf packs or dogs, animals with surprisingly similar behavior to lions (but not other large cats), and also very lethal for their prey.
The full athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, make long-distance jumps and shoot with a force five times that of a strong man.
Tigers fall into the same group (Panthera type) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the roaring voice of a lion, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents or birds. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than this one.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) using the smell, sniffing the ground to find them.
Thanks to night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move undetected. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaged themselves in the environment they are in, then by throwing themselves at the prey.
When a small group of creatures (a small population) comes to be isolated from their main population (for example, if they move over a mountain range or a river or if they move to a new island, where they cannot return easily), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The initial population has not changed at all, needs the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we won't be able to say they're the same species.
This process is called species, which means the formation of new species. The species is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale (i.e. they expel it from their lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun, by photosynthesis.
We make our plant homes and we make plant clothes. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals couldn’t survive.
The Mosasaur was the peak predator of his time, having no fear of anything but other mosques.
His long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in his palate, which means that nothing that came his way could get away with it.
We don’t know for sure, but it could have had bifurcated tongue. Its food included turtles, large fish, other species of mossaurians, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacks anything that goes into the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex could have coped with it.
While most of their kitchen would be familiar, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails and a rodent called fart.
Another difference was that while poor people and women were eating sitting in a chair, rich men liked to make banquets in which they lay on one side while eating.
The kitchen of ancient Rome could not include food that arrived in Europe, America, or Asia in the later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient novel ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to respond to the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard of the temple and an internal sanctuary into which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramid-shaped towers were built called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was in the open air.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops were just the counters that gave way to the streets.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was a little colonized. In the Scandinavian saga, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while traveling further west, he found Green Earth and called it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discoveries, Eskimo tribes were already living in those places at the time.
Although they were all "Scandian" countries, there were many differences in the population, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you watched the film National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
‘On the back of the declaration of independence you can read the words: ‘Original Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776’. The text appears upside down.’
Although it is not known with certainty who wrote it, it is known that, at its beginning, the large parchment document (measured 293⁄4 inches on 241⁄2 inches) had been kept rolled.
Therefore, the marking was probably simply made for labelling.
D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
"It was led by the French "from Vichy". These were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked alongside the invaders instead of fighting against them."
"On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American forces along with free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people living and working cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from Latin civilism, i.e. civility, being related to Latin civis, i.e. citizen, and civitas, i.e. city or city-state; it also defines in a way the size of society.
State cities are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over many generations, a persistent cultural footprint and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as actual civilizations.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – the Congress being its only component – under the Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes and, because there was no executive or judicial authority at national level, relied on state authorities, often non-cooperative, to implement its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to annul tax laws and charges between states.
The articles imposed unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football, together with the German national football team, ranked second in the world's most successful teams and were the FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
In Japan there are almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), which makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
"Because of the groups of islands that Japan has, it is often said that Japan is geographically an archipelago."
The beginning of Taiwan was long ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwest Taiwan, beginning a transformation into Aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644 - 1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1984–1855), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it surrendered sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which rules the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration works continue to this day.
For example, the most common static photo format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant size of the film at the end of the analog era.
It is produced nowadays but, more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
The 35 mm, somewhat confusing, is actually 36 mm in width 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing to twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore declared to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. family of APS formats) are identical to or very close to this proportion.
The rule of the thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a suggestion to create dynamism, while maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place for positioning the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, Christian religion has linked European states to each other, despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected all, from king to mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to ease suffering and poverty and that church monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church was over a thousand years old in Rome, and this concentration of power and money made many question whether the principle was really respected.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proved effective, disrupting the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated the generally accepted international law provisions, enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
With the response to this tactic reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the event of its undefeated submarine war.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only four cents in his pocket, a poem book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous employer) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different periods of time; each stage of China or every family that held power was a distinct dynasty.
Also, the periods between consecutive dynasties were marked by divided provinces. The best known interval of this kind was the Period of the Three Kingdoms, over 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce wars took place between many noblemen fighting for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China's history, thousands of people dying fighting to occupy the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist system to a republican one, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution men were able to accept all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
Same for the military, because instead of the class-based armed hierarchy, they were now relying on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in things that went beyond the mundane ones. He used to go often to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira", located on Mount "Noor" (light).
The cave itself, which has survived over time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know its existence. Once you get inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
The only things you can see are the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders of the world that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
"Giza Plateau, also called "Necropola Giza", from the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller graves, a series of temples and the great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
‘The mark “trace up” looks like a V, and the marking “trace down” looks like a staple or square missing the bottom part.’
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow; down means you have to start at the frog (i.e. at the side you grab the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A feature of the bow upwards usually generates a gentler sound, whereas a trait downwards is stronger and more determined.
Do not hesitate to sign your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for bow features are there for musical reasons and should normally be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse of 11 years and Louis-Charles of four years) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a mob of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They moved back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and screaming threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and the Queen to leave the windows of the carriage wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles before the eyes of the frightened queen.
The war expenses of the imperialism of the United States in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear much of the expenses and interest on bonds placed on behalf of the Filipino government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period during which events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a related logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside cultural and political influence and that technology, in turn, has “effects” on society that are inherent rather than social conditional."
For example, one might say that the car necessarily leads to road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the ownership costs of cars.
A large number of car owners lead to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, leading to the invention of new medical techniques for the healing of bodily harm.
An important component of romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography has shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography have emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, have been better than the laws imposed arbitrarily.
As Paris is considered the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
His name as the center of luxury began to spread through 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
His status was in decline during the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silk and spices more prized than what the Byzantium markets offered.
This was the time when the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine oriental culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years ago.
Toward the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advances of that period was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close clothing.
Sustainability farming is agriculture made to produce sufficient food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological system that uses preserved seeds originating in the same ecological region, together with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers dealt with subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar thinking, who feel cut off from society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of members.
Characteristics distinguishing a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinct and symbolic use of the characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerism and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to inspire themselves in a few unfortunate cases of children who, as a result of negligence, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
“Such children are called “untamed” or savage. Some wild children have been seized by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of the child was due to rejection by parents due to severe intellectual or physical deficiencies.”
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing home.
Some are thought to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when fully reared by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for him, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding or yard method is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Skeletons can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little pinman in Microsoft Office.
Virtual schematics are included in the software, acting to interrogate, provide clues and explain procedures that otherwise might be too complicated for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in family care for many reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse, even to extortion.
There shouldn't be children growing up in an environment where they lack food, love and education, but they do.
We perceive the family care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe accommodation, caring caregivers, solid education and reliable healthcare.
Family care is supposed to cover the needs of children, who were not covered in the house in which they had previously been.
The Internet combines mass and interpersonal communication elements.
Different characteristics other than the Internet introduce additional dimensions in addressing the types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialisation" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions, facial movements that last several milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it is possible to see whether a person is lying through the correct interpretation of facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech", showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage manage to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations and selection removes them from the set of cast variations.
Separation and recombination make each generation the direction of variation dominated by one or the other of the two genetic funds.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet the amino acids requirements of available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so entails serious consequences: slowing down growth, malnutrition and eventually death.
The most easily accessible vegetable resources were leaf proteins and legumes, but they are hard to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
Unlike these, feed of animal origin (ant, termite, egg) is not only easy to digest, but also offers large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
“With all this in mind, it should not surprise us if our ancestors have solved the “protein problem” in a way similar to chimpanzees in today’s savannahs.”
Interrupting sleep is the procedure by which you intentionally wake up during the normal sleep period to return to sleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a conscious state without waking up fully.
If you happen to reset the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to stop it.
Other options based on the biorhythm involve drinking liquids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bedtime, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace that a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one’s body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is. Each has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of this goal is their own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, to which the Mahayaan path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga have been added.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the way of universal love.
In Yoga Kundalini, Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga stations, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By viewing different deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the clashes of system, process and culture led to the distancing of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was going to take forty years, and it would be fought seriously, by "delegated" armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, the plans became useless almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union were put in motion creating Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one side of the oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's role was to ensure the ability of a country to move people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have managed to occupy Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
The cultures and tribes of old began to keep them near the house for easy access to milk, wool, flesh, and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, usually in the care of goats that were often children or teenagers, similar to well-known sheep. These shepherding methods are still used today.
Wagonway roads have been built in England since the 16th century.
Although these Wagonways consist only of wooden planks arranged in parallel, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could have done on the slightly more irregular roads of that time.
The crossings were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place. However, gradually, it was concluded that the rails would be more effective if they had a metal band on top.
This has become a widespread practice, but iron has led to faster wearout of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were produced entirely made of iron.
The first known means of transport was walking; people began to walk upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning the right man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually go upright.
There is bipedal specialization in fossils by Australopithecus 4,2-3,9 million years old, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus had already gone biped seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists in order to reduce to some extent future suffering.
This is just like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don’t just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are now bigger because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After his adoption by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 children were made, known as Dunlap Posters."
On July 8th, John Nixon's first public reading of the document was made in Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July, and a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 still existing Dunlap posters are the oldest copies of the document that survived. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds can still see many characteristics similar to dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on the two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Basically, all computers used today are based on the manipulation of coded information in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number may contain only one of the two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and the name of these numbers is binary digits or bits, in computer lingo.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication for internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicinal products or household toxic chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions on that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates in the old resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects very adapted to parasitic people.
Both killer beetles and bedbugs are nidicoles, adapted to life in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are almost 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) known, meaning it is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is neither in their best interests nor in that of the child.
These couples can choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the event of adoption, natural parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
Not only though, experimentation and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible assumptions, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers mainly used classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas on all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of Greek fell, the West found itself separated from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not mere responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most of the living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important evidence in favor of the DNA hypothesis is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophagus, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments marking either bacteriophagus DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations may have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in any other part can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism around nature exploration attracts interested people to visit natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
One example would be to visit, photograph and find out more about the Orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small country settlements to go to their jobs, passing by others whose destination of work is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport pod, everyone somehow has something to do with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has dislocated the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about transport systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or the collapse of bridges are rarely encountered in developed countries.
Why do transport systems give rise to such grievances, why fail every day? Is it because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something worse happening?
The traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the way they interact with each other.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult, because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute precision.
Fortunately, the behavior of the rulers tends to remain within reasonably constant limits; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
In order to better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main features: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to start flying. The ability to fly allowed them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and partners for mating more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along the body.
That gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerides.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some felt that he was right, but many believed otherwise; that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
Seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
Not less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6.87 km (3.980 miles). It accumulates thousands of smaller waters.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical skill of construction.
Ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of the Vatican Fortress is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican Fortress uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the language most people use every day, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known since ancient times some fundamental chemicals, such as gold, silver and copper, because they can be found in nature in native condition and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, issued a theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air and fire.
He reminded rather of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he had theorized and turned into another substance to take the form we see.
The alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys can also include small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny, that trillions could fit at the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a friend to many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer means of writing appeared, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens without ever having to get their hands on a sharpener.
You can only ask yourself what the fate of the keyboard will be when something newer appears.
The fission bomb works according to the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy wagon to the hill. Breaking the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decompose with little or no impulse.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called bark.
The bark has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker in the higher relief areas.
There might be more maria on the near side, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
The theories of content are focused on identifying the elements that attract people's attention or please them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with the development to maturity.
These theories study what causes some to want to do what they do and what they do in their environment can cause or not to do certain things.
Two popular theories on content are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Herzberg's two factors.
Generally, two types of behaviors can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues. An extreme is trying to remain “one of the boys” (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulties in making unpopular decisions, in carrying out disciplinary actions, performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and empowering people.
On the other side of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals, who think they have to change everything the team has done and do in their own style.
After all, the leader is the main responsibility for the team’s success or failure.
Often, this behavior leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual members of the team often have the role of providing a contact point for their physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of the conventional team, as their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the long process of setting up a learning organisation? An aim of implementing organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used in the functional departments of an organisation in an efficient way, creativity and ingenuity can manifest freely.
As a result, the process by which an organisation works unitarily to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to get organisations to achieve higher performance.
Data from neurobiology are physical evidence that underpins a theoretical approach to cognition investigation. As such, it allows to narrow the research area and define it with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes of the brain never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes that are taking place in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and adapting intelligence to machines.
Research in AI involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, but several software applications for personal computers and video games have also been used.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while in the classroom.
Virtual sharing of a field trip is also an excellent way to reflect on the journey and share experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the site is remodeled, and previous versions are maintained online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve the student’s written expression. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
As students often represent the most critical audience, the author of the blog starts working to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
“Also, the blogging “obliges students to be more aware of the surrounding world.” The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).”
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to expand their study far beyond the ordinary school day.
"The proper use of blogs "can help students to think more analytically and critically; actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of others' writings, and shape their own perspectives on certain issues" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a series of art galleries and museums presenting Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north hosts the undefiled natural beauty of Muskoka County and many others.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider Canadian by excellence.
Large portions to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations who have the gift to surprise many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The eastern islands of Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and true continent of its own when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are famous as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam into those lands, which was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the maritime path from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It is good to wear a wedding ring, but not to seem expensive.
Women should take into account that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and it is not out of the ordinary to be followed, held by hand, etc.
Be determined when you refuse a man and do not fear to stand firm (cultural differences or not, still does not mean it is OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used as a strategic port of Phoenicians, Romans and Marines, called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it by calling it Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755, following an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who had established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tajines, ceramics, leather objects, hookahs and a lot of all sorts of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the easternmost part of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the settlement streets, especially the center area.
While Goma is a pretty safe place, for out-of-town visits, an information effort is required to understand the state of the fight that is still being fought in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the basis for escalating the Nyiragongo volcano, offering some of the cheapest trips in the footsteps of African mountain gorillas.
The usual price (local) of a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"In addition to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be metaphorically used in the sense of exotic, remote places."
Nowadays, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world heritage sites in danger, due to the danger posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS special show by Henry Louis Gates, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in sharp contrast with the rest of the country's cities, as it has a flair more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and Crocodiles River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of national parks in the country (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees for the park.
It could also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows either entry into a series of parks in South Africa or into all national parks in South Africa.
The name of Hong Kong territory is given by Hong Kong Island and is the place that many tourists regard as the central point.
The exhibition of buildings that contribute to the Hong Kong horizon was likened to a bright bar diagram that is valued by the presence of Victoria's waters.
To have the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the urbanly developed part of Hong Kong Island is crammed onto the land recovered along the northern coasts.
This is the space that British settlers have acquired and therefore for who is looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 miles), from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans was declared UNESCO World Heritage. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, however - they also include some of the last of the vast jungles that once covered the plain of the Ganges.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about a third is found covered by water/malaștine.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has become a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (over the river) throughout the day, though most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 7:30.
Since buses connecting districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby targets such as Paro (150 No) or Punakha (200 No).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a suspended bridge. It stretches down the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes of 3.50 m wide.
The free passage height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011, was not open to circulation until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
Guaraní was the most important indigenous population to live in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived hunting, picking and fishing.
"Paraguay, formerly called the Giant Province of the Indies, was born in the 16th century, after Spanish conquistadors met their indigenous groups."
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has, with efforts, preserved much of its indigenous specificity and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tour of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Association of Polo.
The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is determined as the equivalent of 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store.
British lira will generally be accepted all over the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outer islands, although they are likely to receive the British and American currency; get in touch with the owners early to find out what means of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to change the pounds from Falkland outside the country, so you must change them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer when the Northern Hemisphere is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical area; during the summer months, temperatures frequently reach above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below the freezing point, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making perceived friction more intense than the thermometer indicates.
‘There are no particularly rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.’
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile it may seem, the bison, the moose, the bear and almost all other large animals can attack the man.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they haven't kept the right distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so it's good to give them their space.
In addition, be careful that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be advisable to avoid strong-smelling foods and keep the place clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and was the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a sad naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the murder of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is between two ports. The most famous of them are located in three areas.
North Shore Beaches (north harbor) on the shores of the Pacific Ocean range from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where you can swim safely, and most of them have shade from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the port of Waitemata, in the square suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide range of shops along the shore. You can swim safely.
The main local beer is “Number One”; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called “Manta”.
You can find many French wines, but the New Zealand or Australian wines would go better.
Local tap water is drinkable, but if you have fears you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of flat white coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is “espresso”, cappuccino comes full eye with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. Fruit juices are peppered as price, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and the wounds from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near the beaches and near the estuaries of the rivers from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be found outside this period.
Sharks exist, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of people and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
The reservation in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have deals with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to and from the airport or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to purchase other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests must be addressed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of participants in musical festivals choose to camp on the ground, and most participants consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to catch a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main scenes is over, there can be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic Sea during winter, take note of the location of the cabin, as navigation among the ices produces an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent here by customers and the money they spend. Usually, there are no windows and clocks, and exits can be hard to find.
Usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep the mood and guests to stay in the local.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and good players know how important it is to stay lucid.
Who will lead to high latitudes or mountain steps shall consider the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On frozen and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like dry asphalt.
During the blizzard, in a very short period, enough snow may fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or blizzard or condensation, or the formation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari are probably Africa’s main tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as is commonly used, refers to the land voyages undertaken to see the amazing wild animals in Africa, especially those in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better using binoculars.
‘A safari on foot (also referred to as ‘a walk through the bushes’, ‘safari trip’, or ‘on foot’) consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for a few days.’
Paralympic games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two summer Olympics.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay is announced, you may face a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March the cancellation policies for reasons of coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets to events are expected to cost between 2500 and 130,000, with regular tickets costing around 7000.
Breaking wet clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that you can borrow, even if they do not exist in the room.
If you do not have an iron or if you do not like to wear ironed stockings, then you can try using a hairdryer if you have one handy.
Be careful not to let the material get too hot (which can cause contraction or, in extreme cases, combustion).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters differ in efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider the option of buying water in closed bottles from a company with a good reputation.
Travelers can meet pests they're not familiar with at home.
Harmers can damage food, cause irritation or, in serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can harm or kill a man using physical force are generally not considered harmful.
Shopping duty-free offers you the opportunity to buy duty-free goods in certain places.
Travellers visiting high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The portion between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult traffic conditions across the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often crossing isolated and unplanned areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes and dangerous curves prevail.
Speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is all the more important to adhere strictly.
However, rather bizarre, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other sections of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of the southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit confectionery is common, with apples being used throughout the year and cherries and plums making their appearance in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, taste what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
‘A curry may be “dry” or “liquid” depending on the quantity of liquid.’
In the inner regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and in other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands you can choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
Used without other qualifications, however, the term tends to indicate food originating in central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a series of varieties spiced with simplicity, the predominant tastes of Javaneses being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanian coconut sugar) and various flavored spices.
The stairs support the rider's feet, hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider better stability, but they can pose safety concerns, because it's possible that a rider's legs are stuck in them.
If a rider falls out of the saddle, but stays with one leg hanging from the ladder, the horse can drag him when he runs. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
Above all, most riders wear heeled riding boots and a smooth and narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the ladder straps to get off the saddle if pulled back by a horseman who falls out of the saddle.
The Cochamó Valley - the most popular mountaineering site in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and high granite peaks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their top. Climbers from all sides of the world continually plot new routes through the walls with unlimited potential.
Sports involving diving on snow, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, which consist of sliding down the snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard board attached to the feet.
“Schiatism is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called “ski booms” in English, which organizes entire holidays around skiing in a certain place.”
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have cave paintings that represent skiers since before 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened their first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Hiking with your backpack back on skis: This activity is also called skiing in unmarked areas, ski or ski hiking.
It is a related activity, but usually does not involve climbing or climbing ski tournaments, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrains and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar trail of hiking.
Under good conditions, you will manage to cover longer distances than walking – but very rarely you will be able to achieve typical background skiing speeds without a heavy backpack in the back, on neat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean repeatedly going through visa procedures and passport control.
In this respect, the Schengen area is organised in a way as one country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to do so at passport checkpoints.
Similarly, who has a Schengen visa must not obtain a visa for each of the individual Schengen member countries, thereby saving time, money and documents to be obtained.
There is no universal definition that determines which articles are antiquities. Some tax agencies consider antiques goods older than 100 years.
The definition varies according to geographical location, where the age limit could be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced objects.
The growth of reindeer is an important source of income among the Sams, and trade-related culture is also important for many who have other trades.
However, not all members of the Sámi population have traditionally been involved in the large-scale growth of reindeer, but have lived on fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as animals of burden.
Nowadays, many sami have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the sámi area.
"Although widely used, especially among non-Romas, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population."
If the country you are going to visit is the subject of a passenger warning, it may affect your travel health insurance or travel insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than yours, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
One example is how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Tips are just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and oversimplified manner, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
‘Extreme weather conditions’ means a generic term, used for any type of dangerous weather phenomenon, which has the potential to cause damage, serious social disturbances or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and are of several kinds, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and uncontrolled fires are severe weather forms and effects, as well as storms, tornadoes, marine thrombes and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal climate phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to pay attention to the severe weather risks that concern the area, as it could mess up their travel plans.
It is appropriate that anyone planning to travel to a country that can be considered a war zone should have professional training.
An Internet search for a "hostile environmental course" is likely to provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address much more detailed all the issues discussed here, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role playing, much first aid and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are quite large, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning to undergo a sex change operation in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for the return trip.
The opening of governments to the possibility of issuing passports on which sex (X) is not declared or updated documents to correspond to the desired name and sex is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies equally.
The searches at the checkpoints also became much more intrusive after 11 September 2001.
Transgenders who have not yet performed surgery should not expect to pass through scanners without affecting their privacy and dignity.
Return currents represent the return flow to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often to a reef or similar formation.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there can be a rapid current to the deep waters.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in an attempt to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to move towards a position where you are not trapped again and, depending on your abilities and whether or not someone has seen you, you may want to wait to be saved.
The shock of returning home manifests faster than the cultural shock (it persists less from the euphoria of the honeymoon), has a longer duration and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to new culture sometimes experience special difficulties in re-adapting to their native culture.
If you had come home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost your habits in your native culture.
When you had just gone abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that visiting a new country involved an adaptation process.
The world does not always expect patience and understanding to be necessary to travel home.
The sound and light show organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the whole area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually the noise made by tourists and sellers is constantly heard. The sound and light performance seems to be drawn from a book of stories.
The sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Decepticon Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The region of the southern peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The mountains of the Peninsula unite to give birth to this plateau, then split again to form the 360km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
On the north side, called the Sentinel chain, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Vinson Mountain rising to 4892 m.
In isolated places, without phone reception, a satellite phone could be your only option.
A satellite phone in general cannot take the place of a cell phone, because you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite in order to make a call.
The service is often used in maritime transport, including recreational craft, as well as by expeditions requiring remote transmission of data and voice.
The local telephone service provider could give you more information about your connection to this service.
An ever-increasing alternative used by people who plan a year off is to combine the journey with the study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before attending a university, without jeopardising their educational course.
In many cases, enrolment to one year of courses abroad may even increase your chances of going to higher education in your country of origin.
There is normally a tuition fee that is paid when enrolling in these educational programmes.
"Finland is a wonderful place for rowing. «The land of the thousand lakes» also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the coastal archipelagos."
In archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelago off the coast and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with a boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is 1 to 40).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer a prolonged stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore on trips aboard a ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009)
Some cruise brochures present Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is in no way close to the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they fly for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes towards other things, which manifests in many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is essential in terms of documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies own their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they've sent something through the air, some routes can take days to unload and clear.
The only way to get him to pass faster was to be sent as hold baggage. The airline regulations won't allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business is to pay a large wad of money for this privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do this for you).
But it is not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate in business class, and in first class up to eleven times more!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts for business or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere fast and comfortable, in which context they charge tariffs as required.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from an interethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by any UN member country.
Economic ties between these two sides of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Christian Orthodoxism.
It is the third largest city of Turkey, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second port after Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna is now a bustling, developed and modern shopping centre, located around an enormous bay and surrounded by mountains.
The large boulevards, along with glass façade buildings and modern shopping centers, are equipped with traditional red roofs from the 18th century, as well as with old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that reminds of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.

You are asked to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect they deserve. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by drawing and scratching on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically everyone knows Spanish.
However, most panels are only made in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
Spanish, however, is widely used in public transport along with other services.
Regular subway announcements are only made in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automatic system in different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known as self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
"Although it is often just a stereotype that does not conform to reality, in order to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as best as possible, as someone who is "bien élevé" (well raised). It will help you manage with much more ease."
The reserved attitude of the Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you demonstrate a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, mainly with beech, spruce and fir and has a mixture of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different types of soils and altitude levels.
The region also houses an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the laugh, the wild cat and the mountain rooster can be found here, along with many more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide cover for women who come unprepared, but if you bring yours, especially one in vivid colors, you will get a smile from the monk or the mother at the entrance.
Similarly, men have to wear pants to cover their knees.
And they can be borrowed from those available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. Unique size for men!
The kitchen in Majorca, like the one in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially during summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available spices such as cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always start with capital, even inside the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somehow complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or adjective being used in a nounized form.
The pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most being pronounced exactly as written
The letters you need to be more careful about are c and g, because their pronunciation varies according to their vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce differently r and rr: which means drag, whereas carro means car.
Persian has a relatively light and generally regular grammar.
Thus, reading this grammar manual will help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to understand the phrases better.
Obviously, anyone who knows a Romanic language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little bit of Spanish can conclude prematurely that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated nowadays and remain open as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, it is usually in cities or campuses, which are more easily accessible than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in remote areas with favourable weather conditions.
The gaze of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the flowers chosen.
In Japan, the first parties dedicated to the cherry blossom were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy of the imperial court.
Plants don't look any better than they do in their natural environment, so don't let yourself be tempted to reap even one of them.

Christmas is one of the most important celebrations of Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions of this celebration have been adopted both by unbelievers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in the open, to see the sun rise.
For this tradition, of course, there are explanations in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often organize an Easter wake Saturday night in the Great Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that initially arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the remoteness of the continent, mammals failed to make the journey, resulting in the giant turtle being the main animal grazing in the Galapagos.
Since human arrival in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the boreal aurora, because the sky will be, more or less, dark at that time.
Because areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy stars.
The Japanese work culture has a stronger hierarchical and more formal character than the Westerners are accustomed to.
Costumes are standard business clothing, and coworkers address each other using their last name or job title.
