The organisers of the protest said that about 100,000 people participated in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg or Hanover.
In Berlin, police estimated the number of protesters at 6500.
Protests also took place in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valetta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia, as well as Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
In London, about 200 people protested in front of the offices of major copyright holders.
Last month big protests took place in Poland when the country signed ACTA, leading to the Polish government's decision not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Latvia and Slovakia both delayed their accession to ACTA.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty from Animals (RSPCA) are again calling for mandatory installation of surveillance cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses.
Chief RSPCA inspector in New South Wales, David O'Shannessy, told ABC that surveillance and inspection of slaughterhouses should be routine operations in Australia.
The CCTV system will certainly let those working with animals know that their welfare is a priority.
The international earthquake map of the United States Geological Prospection Service did not indicate earthquakes in Iceland for the previous week.
Iceland's meteorological office has also not announced any seismic activity in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours.
The significant activity of the earthquake that led to the change of phase took place on March 10th, on the northeast side of the caldera on the top of the volcano.
Dark clouds, unrelated to volcanic activity, were reported at the base of the mountain.
The clouds created the premise of confusion over whether or not a real eruption occurred.
Luno was on board 120 to 160 cubic metres of fuel, when he suffered the malfunction and the strong winds and the waves pushed him towards the pier.
The twelve crew members were rescued with helicopters and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-metre ship was in the process of picking up its usual fertiliser load, and initially officials feared that the ship might spill a load.
The proposed amendment had already been adopted by both chambers in 2011.
An amendment was introduced during this legislative session when the second sentence was first removed by the House of Representatives, then adopted in a similar form on Monday by the Senate.
Refusing the second sentence, which proposes the prohibition of same-sex civil unions, could open the door to civil unions in the future.
Following the procedure, in order to remain in place, HJR-3 will be reviewed again in 2015 or 2016 by the next legislature.
Vautier's accomplishments, apart from what he achieved as a director, include a hunger strike in 1973, to protest what he considered to be political censorship.
The French law was amended. He began his work as an activist when he was 15 years old and joined the French Resistance during World War II.
He wrote about himself in a book in 1998.
In the 1960s, he returned to Algeria, a new independent state, to teach film directorship.
Hitoshi Saito, a Japanese judoka winner of two Olympic gold medals, died at the age of 54.
Cause of death has been announced, a cancer of the intrahepatic bile ducts.
He died Tuesday in Osaka.
In addition to being a former Olympic and world champion at the time of his death, Saito was chairman of the preparatory committee of the All Japan Judo Federation.
At least 100 people had attended the party to celebrate a couple's first anniversary last year.
An official anniversary event was scheduled for a later date, authorities announced.
The couple had married in Texas a year ago and had come to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old husband, born in Buffalo, was one of four killed during the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno was a well-known but controversial English teacher who taught Modern Education and King's Glory and claimed to have 9,000 students at the height of his career.
In his lecture notes, he used words that some parents thought were grobian, and it is said that he used swearing in class.
Modern Education accused him of printing large commercials on buses without authorization and lied that he was the head teacher of the English department.
He was also previously charged with copyright violations, but was not found guilty.
One former student said that "he used slang words during class, taught skills for dating in notes, and was like a "friend" of students.
In the last three decades, although it has officially remained a communist state, China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were made under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economy has grown 90 times.
China exported for the first time last year more cars than Germany and surpassed the United States, which is the largest market in this industry.
China's GDP could exceed that of the United States in less than two decades.
The tropical storm Danielle, the fourth storm to be given its own name in the 2010 season of Atlantic hurricanes, was formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located about 3,000 miles away from Miami, Florida, has winds with a maximum sustained speed of 40 mph (64 kph).
Scientists at the National Center for Hurricanes predict that by Wednesday Danielle will develop to the hurricane stage.
Since the storm is far from land, it is still difficult to assess the impact it might have on the United States or the Caribbean.
Born in Croatia's capital, Zagreb, Bodek gained fame while playing for Belgrade's Partizan.
He joined them in 1945 and remained until 1958.
During his team time, he scored 403 goals in 468 field trips.
No one has played in more games and scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
In 1995, he was voted the best player in the history of Partizan.
The celebration began with a special show by the world-renowned band Cirque du Soleil.
It was followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, a group of Janissars and singers Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.
Then the Dervisi Spinners went up on stage.
The famous Turkish singer Sezen Aksu sang alongside Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
"In conclusion, the Turkish dance group Flame of Anatolia held the show «Troia»."
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old biker, died after being involved in an accident on Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During the warm-up tour, Lenz fell off his bike and was then struck by his colleague Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately given medical care by the medical staff on the runway and was transported to a local hospital where he later died.
Zayat wasn't hurt in the accident.
“In relation to the global financial situation, Zapatero continued to say that “the financial system is a part of the economy, a vital part.”
“We have a one-year financial crisis, the last two months being the worst period, and I think the financial markets are starting to recover now.”
Last week, Naked News announced it would dramatically extend its international mandate for news reporting with three new channels.
Already broadcasting in English and Japanese, the global organisation will launch programmes for television, web and mobile devices in Spanish, Italian and Korean.
“Fortunately nothing happened to me, but I saw a gruesome scene, while people were trying to break the windows to get out.
People hit the windows with chairs, but the windows were indestructible.
One of the panels finally broke, and they started coming out the window," said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Stars emit light and heat due to energy produced when hydrogen atoms are united (or merged) together to form heavier elements.
Scientists work to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
But this is an extremely difficult problem to solve, and it will be many years before we can build useful fusion reactors.
The steel needle floats at the surface of the water due to the surface tension force.
The surface tension occurs because water molecules on the surface of the water are attracted more strongly to each other than are to the air molecules above them.
Water molecules form an invisible layer on the surface of water that allows objects such as a needle to float above the water.
The blade of a modern ice skate has two edges with a concave region between them. The two edges allow better contact with the ice, even when they are tilted.
Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, as the blade tilts one side or the other bends and the edge that is in contact with the ice.
This makes the skater turn. If the skates lean to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skates tilt to the left, the skater turns to the left.
In order to return to the previous energy level, it must eliminate the additional energy it received from light.
"I do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called photon."
“Scientists call this process “radiation-stimulated emission”, because atoms are stimulated by strong light, leading to the emitting of a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation.”
The next picture shows the atoms emitting photons. Of course, the actual photons are much smaller than the ones in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the things that make up atoms!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament of the light bulb is finally burned and the light bulb is no longer working.
Then you need to change the light bulb. Changing the light bulb must be done carefully.
First, the switch for the luminaire must be switched off or the cable disconnected.
This is because the electricity in the nozzle, where the metal part of the light bulb is inserted, can seriously electrocute you if you touch the inside of the nozzle or the metal base of the light bulb when it is still in part inside the nozzle.
The major organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps the blood.
Blood goes from the heart into vessels called arteries and returns to the heart in vessels called veins. The smallest vessels are called capillaries.
The teeth of a triceratops would have been able to grind not only leaves, but also very strong roots and branches.
Some scientists believe that triceratops fed on cycadophyte-class plants, a type of plant commonly found in the cretaceous.
These plants look like little crowned palm trees composed of sharp and thorny leaves.
A triceratops could have used its strong beak to remove the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists claim that these plants are extremely toxic and therefore it is unlikely that any dinosaur has consumed them, although nowadays sloth and other animals such as parrots (a descendant of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves and fruits.
How would the force of gravity affect me on Io? If you were standing on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than you weigh on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io. So the force of gravity, of course, pulls you down less.
The sun doesn't have a crust as hard as the Earth, on which you can sit. The whole sun is made up of gases, fire and plasma.
The gas is thinning as the distance from the center of the Sun increases.
"The external part that we can see looking at the Sun is called a photosphere, meaning "the sphere of light."
About 3,000 years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, using a telescope, observed that Venus had phases, just like the Moon.
The phases occur because only the side of Venus (or the Moon), oriented towards the Sun, is illuminated. The phases of Venus supported Copernicus' theory that planets revolve around the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a transit of Venus.
England had a long period of peace after the conquest of Danelaw territory.
However, in 991 Ethelred faced a larger Viking fleet than any other in the last century, after Guthrum's.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with ambitions to free his country from Danish rule.
After initial military failure, Ethelred managed to agree with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try, with more or less success, to regain his kingdom.
Hangul is the only alphabet invented for specific purposes, commonly used. The alphabet was invented in 1444 during the reign of King Sejong (1418 - 1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and is one of the most respected.
"Initially, he called the alphabet Hangeul, Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the right sounds for training people."
There are many theories about the origins of Sanskrit, one of which concerns a migration of Aryans from the West to India, bringing their language with them.
Sanskrita is an old language and is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the collection of the Upanishads, the Sanskrit passed into oblivion because of the hierarchy.
Sanskrita is a very complex and rich language, which has proven to be the source of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the source for European languages, such as French and Spanish.
With the end of the fighting for France, Germany began to prepare to invade the British island.
Germany gave the code name "Operation Sea Lion" to the attack. Most of the heavy weapons and supplies of the British army had been lost during the evacuation from Dunkirk, so the army was quite weak.
But the Royal Navy was still a force far superior to the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any invasion fleet that would have crossed the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were docked near possible invasion routes, as the admirals feared they would be sunk by a German air strike.
"Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was mainly the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
He had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although they had built four new ships just before the beginning of the war.
The main objective of Italy was African countries. In order to occupy those countries, they would have needed a platform to launch troops so that they could cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
To this end, they had to get rid of the British bases and ships in Egypt. Apart from these actions, the Italian warships had to do nothing else.
Now let's move on to Japan. Japan was an island country, just like Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and remain there for a long time.
Submarines were used in World War I and in World War II. At that time they were very slow and had a very limited range.
At the beginning of the war, they traveled close to the surface of the water, but as the radar began to develop and become more accurate, submarines were forced to go underwater so they wouldn't be seen.
German submarines were called U-boats. The Germans were very skilled when it came to sailing and operating their submarines.
Because of their success with the submarines, after the war, the Germans were not allowed to have much.
"Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes called «King Tut» or «King Boy», is one of the kings of ancient Egypt best known today."
Interestingly, it was not considered to be very important in ancient times and was not recorded on most of the lists of ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous. While many of the tombs of the past were plundered, this tomb remained virtually untouched.
Most of the objects buried next to Tutankhamun were preserved well, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
The invention of spokes wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter, faster and better prepared to overcome soldiers and other chariots of battle.
The arrows of their lethal bows could penetrate the armor of the enemy soldiers. Around 1000 B.C.E., the Assyrians were the first to use the cavalry.
The cavalry is the army that fights on horseback. The saddle had not yet been invented, so the Assyrians fought straight on the back of the horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Probably the most famous person of this culture is Homer, the legendary blind poet, who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems of Iliad and Odyssey.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still appreciated playwrights and their plays are considered to be among the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, especially known for his famous theorem about the relationships between the sides of the rectangular triangle.
There are different estimates of the number of Hindi speakers. It is estimated that it would be from the second to the fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies and depends whether or not dialects are closely linked.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers and up to 800 million people who can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu languages have similar vocabulary, but differ on writing; usually, in everyday conversations, speakers of these languages can understand each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was strongly influenced culturally by Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the natives, so they invented Estonian literal language.
‘It was based on the German alphabet, to which a letter was added, ‘Õ/õ’.’
In time, many words borrowed from the German merged in the language. This was the beginning of enlightenment.
According to tradition, the heir to the throne was to join the army immediately after finishing school.
However, Charles went to college at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied Anthropology and Archaeology, and later History, obtaining a 2:2 (a lower, second-grade degree).
Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to obtain a university degree.
European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia, in the Balkan Peninsula) accounts for 3% of the country's territory.
Turkey's territory is more than 1,600 km (1000 miles) long and 800 km (500 miles) wide, with an approximate rectangular shape.
Turkey's surface, including lakes, is 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) in South-West Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey's occupied area makes it the 37th largest country in the world, roughly as big as metropolitan France and Britain put together.
Turkey is surrounded by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence dates back to 1839.
Some areas of Belgium today were part of Luxembourg in the past, but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of the 1830s.
Luxembourg has always tried to remain a neutral country, but it was occupied by Germany in both World War I and World War II.
In 1957, Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization known today as the European Union.
Drukgyal Dzong is a fortress in ruins and a Buddhist monastery located in the upper part of the Paro District (Phondey village).
Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel is said to have built the fortress in 1649 to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan-Mongol forces.
In 1951, a fire made only some of the relics of Drukgyal Dzong exist, such as the effigy of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress was preserved and protected, remaining one of Bhutan's most sensational attractions.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was between two strong neighbours, Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century, and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.
In the last years of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those with jobs work in the underground economy.
Two-thirds of the people of Venezuela who work are employed in the service sector, almost a quarter work in industry, and the fifth part work in agriculture.
An important industry for Venezuelans is oil, with Venezuela being a net exporter in this area, although only 1% of the population work in this industry.
From the beginning of the country's independence period, the experience of Singapore's Botanical Gardens has been helpful in turning the island into a Tropical Garden City.
In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a hybrid orchid, was chosen as a national flower.
Every year, by October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores travel to the southern plains across the Mara River, coming from the northern hills in search of rain.
Then, after the rains of April, they return to the north passing through the west, crossing the Mara River once again.
The Serengeti region includes the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Zone and the Maswa Hunting Reservation in Tanzania, as well as the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
To learn to create interactive presentations we need both conventional and traditional skills and tools mastered in interactive courses (storyboarding, audio and video editing, narrative techniques, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to reassess your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a nonlinear way.
Interactive design requires the components of a project to connect with each other, but also make sense as a separate entity.
The disadvantage of zoom objectives is that the complexity of the focus process and the number of lenses needed to cover a range of focal distances are much greater than for fixed focus targets.
This is an increasingly rare problem, as target manufacturers achieve higher standards in the production of targets.
This allowed zoom targets to produce images of a quality comparable to that obtained by fixed focal distance targets.
Another disadvantage of lenses for zoom is that the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is usually lower.
For this reason, cheap zoom targets are difficult to use without flash under poor light conditions.
One of the most common problems when trying to convert a movie into DVD format is overscanning.
Most televisions are made to please the general public.
For this reason, all the films we see on TV are cut up, down and sideways.
This is done to make sure the image covers the entire screen. This is called overscanning.
Unfortunately, when a DVD is created, the edges of the image will most likely be cut and, if the film had subtitles too close to the bottom edge, they will not be fully displayed.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired imagination, evoke images of turrets, banquets, and arturian cavalry.
The mere act of standing in the midst of the millennial ruins is enough to imagine the sounds and smells of battles long ago, and we can almost hear the trampling of hoofs on the pavement and feel the fear springing from the underground dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were the castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
A typical construction of the period, Kirby Castle Muxloe is rather a fortified house than a real castle.
Its wide windows with glass windows and thin walls would not have allowed it to withstand a decisive attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began construction, the country was quite quiet and it was necessary to take defensive measures only against small gangs of bandits.
The balance of power was a system whereby European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The idea was that all European nations had to aim to prevent a nation from becoming strong, and so national governments often changed their alliances in order to maintain balance.
The Spanish War of Succession was the first war whose central problem was the balance of powers.
This marked an important change because the European powers would no longer have the pretext to wage religious wars. Thus, the 30-year war would be the last war to be labeled religious war.
The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C.E., in a fire by Herostrat.
According to legend, his motivation was to become famous at all costs. Ephesians, indignant, decreed that Herostrat's name should never be mentioned.
The Greek historian Strabon later recorded his name, allowing us to know him now. The temple was destroyed the same night Alexander the Great was born.
During his reign, Alexander offered to pay for the rebuilding of the temple, but his offer was refused. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.
Make sure your hand stays as relaxed as possible while playing all the notes correctly – and try not to make too many unnecessary movements with your fingers.
This way, you will tire as little as possible. Remember that there is no need to force the keys for a stronger sound, as is the case with the piano.
At the accordion, to increase the volume, handle the bellows stronger and faster.
Mysticism is the quest for communion with, identification with, or awareness of, a final reality, the divine, a spiritual truth, or God.
The believers are looking for a direct experience, a intuition, or an insight into the divine reality/of the deity or gods.
Adepts practice certain ways of life or practices that are meant to fuel those experiences.
Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of faith and religious worship by the emphasis placed on the personal and direct experience of a unique state of consciousness, especially one with a peaceful character, of inner analysis, happiness or even ecstasy.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the Punjab region during the 15th century, following a sectarian schism within the Hindu tradition.
The Sikhs see their religion as separate from Hinduism, although they accept its Hindu origin and traditions.
"The name that the Sikhs give to their religion is Gurmat, which in Punjabi means «the way of the guru». The guru is an essential element of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism has gained special importance, reaching the core of the Sikh faiths."
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539).
However, in June 1956, Krushchev's promises were put to the test when riots in Poland, where workers protested food crises and wage cuts, turned into a general protest against communism.
Although Khrushchev eventually sent tanks to restore order, yielded to economic demands and agreed to appoint the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka as prime minister.
Civilization in the Indus Valley was a bronze-era civilization in the northwest of India's subcontinent, which encompassed most of the modern-day Pakistan area, along with some regions in northwest India and north-eastern Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished on the banks of the Indus River, from which its name was drawn.
Although some researchers speculate that, while civilization was also present in the now dry basin of the Sarasvati River, it would be more accurate to call it the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, while others call it the Harappa Civilization, named after Harappa, the first site where it was discovered in excavations during the 1920s.
The militaristic nature of the Roman Empire helped to develop medical progress.
Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors and even formed the first Roman medical corps to intervene after the battles.
Surgeons knew different sedatives, including morphine from seed extracts da poppy and scopolamine from tooth seeds.
They have improved their ability to amputate to save patients from gangrene, respectively to use turntables and blood clamps to stop bleeding.
Over many centuries, the Roman Empire has facilitated important discoveries in the field of medicine and laid the foundation for a significant part of the knowledge we have today.
Origami Pureland is all origami, but with the limitation that one can make a single fold at a time, one cannot make more complex folds, such as the inverted ones, and all folds are made in obvious positions.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help inexperienced practitioners and those with limited motor skills.
Children develop racial consciousness and racial stereotypes from a rather young age and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify with a stereotyped racial minority as one that does not have good learning outcomes tend to not do well in school once they learn about the stereotype associated with their race.
MySpace is the third website in the order of popularity among those used in the US and currently numbers 54 million users.
Such websites have had a lot of attention, especially in the education area.
These websites also have positive aspects that include, among other things, the ability to easily organize a course page that includes blogs, videos, photos and other items.
This page can be easily accessed using a single web address, making it easy to remember and simple to write for students who have difficulty using a keyboard or spelling.
It can be adapted to facilitate reading, with the amount of color adapted as desired.
“Attention deficit disorder “is a neurological syndrome whose trio of classic defining symptoms include impulsiveness, carelessness and hyperactivity or excess energy.”
"It's not a learning deficiency, it's a learning disorder; it affects between 3 and 5 percent of children, possibly up to 2 million children in America."
Children with ADHD have difficulty concentrating on things such as school activities, but they can focus on activities that please them, such as playing, watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuation marks.
“These children tend to have a multitude of problems, because “they engage in risky behaviors, enter into fights and challenge authority” in order to stimulate their brains, because their brains cannot be stimulated by ordinary methods.”
Attention deficit affects relationships with other people because other children cannot understand why they behave in that way or why they write in that way or that their level of maturity is different.
As the ability to acquire knowledge and learn has changed in the above-mentioned ways, the basic speed of knowledge acquisition has changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. The pressure no longer existed in the individual memory, but the ability to remember a text became the central point.
Essentially, the Renaissance has brought about a significant change in the approach to learning and the spread of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move, to support weight or to launch from tree to tree.
The chimp's hand and foot are similar in size and length, and make it possible to use the hand to support the weight while walking in the fists.
The human hand is shorter in length than the foot and the straighter phalanges.
Fossilized hand bones, two to three million years old, show this shift in hand specialization from locomotion to manipulation.
Some people think it can be extremely tiring to have artificially induced lucid dreams often enough.
This phenomenon occurs mainly because lucid dreams increase the duration between REM states.
With fewer REM sequences per night, this condition in which you get proper sleep and the body recovers becomes rare enough to be a problem.
It's as exhausting as waking up every twenty or thirty minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on how often the brain tries to dream lucidly during one night.
In North Africa, things went pretty bad from the beginning for the Italians. In the week following Italy's declaration of war on 10 June 1940, Britain's 11th Hussars occupied Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Lastucci, the head of the 10th Army's genius troops.
On 28 June, Marshal Italo Balbo, the general governor of Libya and Mussolini's heir, was killed by a friendly fire while landing in Tobruk.
Fencing, as a modern sport, is practiced at many levels, from students who learn it at a university, to professional and Olympic competitions.
Sport is practiced in the form of a duel, one fencer duels with the other.
Golf is a game where players use clubs to hit balls and insert them into holes.
In an ordinary round are played eighteen holes, the players usually starting with the first hole on the ground and ending with the eighteenth.
Win the player who needs the fewest club kicks or kicks to complete the run.
The game is played on the grass, the grass around the hole being cut shorter and called "greens".
The most common type of tourism is perhaps what most people associate with travel: leisure tourism.
This happens when the world moves to relax and have fun in a place much different from those where they spend their everyday lives.
Beaches, theme parks and camping are often the most frequented places by tourists for recreation.
If the purpose of visiting a certain place is to get acquainted with its history and culture, we have a type of tourism known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can tour the various tourist attractions of a country or choose to focus on only one area.
The colonists, observing this activity, also called for reinforcements.
The troops that reinforced the advanced positions included the 1st and 3rd regiments in New Hampshire with 200 men, under the command of the colons John Stark and James Reed (both later became generals).
Stark's men occupied positions along the fence north of the colonial position.
When the low tide opened a gap along the Mystic River and along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence with a short stone wall to the north, ending at the edge of the water with a small beach.
Gridley or Stark stuck a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered no one to fire before ordinary people got past it.
The American plan was based on the coordinated launch of attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder launched a diversionary attack against the British garrison at Bordentown in order to block the deployment of reinforcements.
General James Ewing crossed the river at Trenton Ferry along with 700 militia troops, occupied the bridge over Assunpink Creek and prevented the retreat of enemy troops.
The main assault force, composed of 2,400 men, was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and divide into two groups, one commanded by Greene and one by Sullivan, in order to launch an attack before dawn.
With the shift from a quarter to a half mile, speed becomes much less important, and resistance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class athlete in the half-mile race, one who can travel the distance in less than two minutes, must have a reasonable speed, but must, at any cost, train for resistance.
A few background runs in winter, in combination with the work of the upper body, represent the best preparation for the running season.
Adequate nutritional practices cannot generate single notable performance, but can significantly affect the overall health of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, adopting effective hydration habits and understanding the diverse aspects of food supplements can help athletes improve their performance and increase the pleasure of practicing sport.
Medium distance running is a relatively cheap sport; however, there are many misconceptions about the few pieces of equipment needed to participate.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most will have a real or no impact on performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product, even when it does not bring any real benefit.
The atom can be regarded as one of the fundamental elements of any matter.
It is a very complex entity consisting, according to a simplified Bohr model, of a central nucleus around which electrons orbit, similar to the way plants orbit around the sun – see Figure 1.1.
The core consists of 2 particles - neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electric charge, while neutrons have no charge. Electrons have a negative electric charge.
To check the victim must, first of all, review the area to make sure you are safe.
You need to observe the victim's position as you approach him or her and any automatic alarm signals.
If you hurt yourself while trying to help, maybe you'll only make it worse.
The study concluded that depression, fear and catastrophic attitude mediate the link between pain and disability in those suffering from back pain.
Only the effects of catastrophicization, not depression and fear, were conditioned by weekly structured AF sessions.
Those who regularly took part in physical activities needed more support in terms of negative perception of pain, distinguishing between chronic pain and the feeling of discomfort due to normal physical activity.
The vision, or the ability to see, depends on the sense organs of the visual device, or eyes.
There are many different architectures of the eye, which vary in complexity according to the body's needs.
The different structures have different capabilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different degrees of acuity; they also need different processing to transform the input signal into coherent information and different numbers for optimal operation.
A population represents all organisms of a particular species present in a given geographical area.
When all individuals in a population are identical in terms of a particular phenotypic characteristic, they are known as monomorphs.
When individuals present several variants of a particular feature, they are called polymorphs.
Colonies of legional ants also march and form mussels in various phases.
In the nomadic phase, soldiers ants march at night and rest during the day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when the amount of food available decreases. During this phase, the colony creates temporary nests that are changed every day.
Each of these nomadic outbursts or marches lasts for about 17 days.
“What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word “cella”, meaning “small room”, and was first used by a researcher who noticed the structure of the raft under a microscope.”
The cell is the basic unit of all living beings and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
"Cells are so important for life study that they are often called "the cornerstones of life."
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body in order to maintain blood flow not only movement and constant.
These nerve impulses can be transmitted at high speed throughout the body, which helps to maintain the safety of the body in any potential threat.
Tornados affect areas that are slightly extended compared to other violent storms, but they can wipe out anything that gets in their way.
Tornados pull trees out of the roots, rip out the planks of buildings and lift cars into the air. Two percent of the most violent tornadoes last over three hours.
These monstrous storms have winds that reach up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
People have been developing and using lenses for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first real telescopes were made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a 2 lens system to make objects in the distance seem closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us and it is in the nature of cooperation that when the majority profit, always earn more in the short term by acting selfishly.
Fortunately most people will realize that the best long-term option for them is to work together with others.
Many people dream of the day when human beings will be able to travel to another star and explore other worlds. Some people wonder what is there; others think that aliens or other life forms can live on another planet.
“But if it ever happens, it probably won’t be for a very long time. The stars are so widespread that the “neighbor” stars are trillions of miles apart.”
Perhaps one day your great-grandchildren will step onto the ground of an alien world, wondering about the fate of their ancestors.
Animals are made up of many cells. They eat and digest inside the body. Most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (although not even all animals have brains; jellyfish, for example, do not have brains).
There are animals all over the world. They dig into the ground, swim in the oceans and fly across the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism.
The cell comes from the Latin word cella, which means small room.
If you see living beings under a microscope, you'll see that they're all made up of little squares or circles.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, observed small squares in the raft using a microscope.
They looked like cameras. He was the first person to notice the dead cells.
Elements and compounds can pass from one state to another without changing.
Nitrogen in gaseous form still has the same properties as nitrogen in liquid form. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules are the same.
Water is another example. The water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen molecule.
It has the same molecular structure whether it's gaseous, liquid or solid.
Although his physical state may change, the chemical structure remains the same.
Time is something everywhere around us that affects everything we do, but, however, it is difficult to understand.
Time has been studied for thousands of years by theologians, philosophers and scientists.
We perceive time as a series of events that pass from the future, through the present, into the past.
Time is also what we use to compare the duration (length) of events.
Anyone can measure the passage of time by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is one that takes place over and over again on a regular basis.
Nowadays, computers are used to manipulate images and video sequences.
Sophisticated animations can be created on the computer, and this type of animation is increasingly used in television and movies.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to process and combine sounds.
For a long time, during the nineteenth and twentyth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, hunting for giant birds called moa.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia into a large fleet and took New Zealand from Moriori, setting up an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the morator population was a group of continental Maori, who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, developing their own specific and peaceful culture.
There was another tribe in the Chatham Islands, made up of Maori who had emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori; after a few, the morators were finally wiped off the face of the earth.
People involved over several decades have helped us to assess our strengths and passions, while sincerely appreciating our difficulties and even failures.
Listening to people who shared their stories, their families and the organization, we gained a valuable insight into the past and some personalities that influenced the culture of the organization for better or for worse.
Even if understanding the past doesn't necessarily require understanding culture, it helps people at least get an idea of where they fit into the history of the organization.
Assessing the successes and realizing the failures, individuals and all participating groups deepen the organisation’s values, mission and guiding forces.
In this situation, the reminder of previous courts of entrepreneurial behaviour and of the successes that resulted was helpful to people to be open to change and to a new direction of the local church.
Such success stories have alleviated fears of change, while creating positive inclinations for change in the future.
Converging patterns of thinking are techniques of solving problems that bring together different ideas or areas in order to find a solution.
This kind of thinking focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as identification of facts, application of existing techniques, collection of information.
The most significant aspect of this mentality is that there is only one correct answer. You imagine that there are only two answers, namely right or wrong.
This type of approach is associated with certain scientific disciplines or standard procedures.
People with that kind of thinking think logically, can memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
Humans are by far the most talented species at reading other people's thoughts.
This means that we are able to successfully predict what other human beings perceive, intend, believe, know or desire.
Among these skills, understanding the intentions of others is essential. It allows us to solve the possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you saw someone break into a car window, you'd probably assume they're trying to steal someone's car.
The reasoning should be different if he lost his keys and tried to get into his own car.
The MRI is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (MRI), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Blich (who worked at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to emit tiny radio signals.
In 1970, Raymond Damadian, a physician and researcher, discovered the basic elements for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as a medical diagnostic tool.
Four years later, a patent was issued that represents the world's first patent in the field of MRI imaging.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first MRI scanner for "the whole body", which he named "Indomitable".
Asynchronous communication encourages time for reflection and reaction to others.
It gives students the opportunity to work at their own pace and to control the pace of training information.
In addition, there are fewer temporary restrictions, plus the possibility of a flexible work programme. (Bremer, 1998)
Using the Internet and the World Wide Web allows students access to information at any time.
Students can also send questions to instructors at any time of the day and expect answers quite quickly, rather than waiting until the next face-to-face meeting.
The postmodernist approach to learning provides the liberation of absolutes. There is only one good way to learn.
In fact, there is not one thing to learn. Learning takes place through the experience of the learner with the information presented.
Our current experience, with all the DIY clips and the presentation of information, with the television educational broadcasts, illustrates this view.
So many of us are watching TV shows that give us information about a process or experience that we will never have the opportunity to take part in or to put our knowledge into practice.
We'll never do a car overhaul, we'll never build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to examine the ancient ruins or remodel our neighbor's house.
Thanks to connections with underwater fibre optic cables to Europe and broadband satellites, Greenland is well connected, with 93% of the population having access to the Internet.
Your hotel or hosts (if you stay at a hostel or a private house) will probably have wifi or a computer connected to the internet and all the localities have an internet cafe or a place with public wifi.
"As mentioned above, although the word 'Eskimo' remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered pejorative by many Arctic peoples outside the United States, especially in Canada."
Although it is possible to hear the Greenlanders using the word, foreigners would do well to avoid using it.
The natives of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (plural Kalaallit), meaning Greenland, in Greenland.
“Infractions and threats to foreigners are virtually nonexistent in Greenland. Even in cities, there are no “hard areas.”
The cold is probably the only real danger that the ill-trained will face.
If you visit Greenland during cold seasons (see that the further north you go, the colder it will be), it is essential to get enough thick clothes.
Very long summer days can lead to problems related to sufficient sleep and associated health problems.
During the summer you must also pay attention to the northern mosquitoes. Although they do not transmit any disease, they can be very annoying.
Although San Francisco's economy is dependent on its status as a world-class tourist attraction, it is, however, diversified.
The largest sectors of employment are professional services, public administration, finance, trade and tourism.
His frequent description in music, movies, literature and popular culture made the city and its main landmarks known worldwide.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and top facilities for conventions.
San Francisco is also one of the best places in the country for other Asian cuisines: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
Holidays at Walt Disney World are an important pilgrimage for many American families.
"The regular visit involves a flight to Orlando International Airport, bus transport to a Disney hotel on the premises, a party of about a week without leaving Disney land and then returning home."
"There are an infinite number of possible options, but this is what most people refer to when they say that they go to Disney World."
Many tickets sold online through auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are tickets for several days with the partially used park-hopper option.
Although it is common, it is forbidden at Disney: tickets are not transferable.
A backcountry permit is required in order to be able to camp below the lip level of the Grand Canyon.
Licences are issued in limited number to protect the canyon, and can be obtained from the first day of the month, four months before the month you start hiking.
As such, a backcountry permit for any starting date in May can be obtained from 1 January.
The space for the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel Camping with Phantom Ranch, generally fills from the first day since the opening of reservations.
The number of permits reserved for entry applications is limited, which are distributed according to the first-come, first-served principle.
Visiting South Africa by car is an excellent way to see all the beauties of the region, but also to reach places outside the usual tourist routes.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning, but a 4x4 is highly recommended and many locations are accessible only with a 4x4 with large wheels.
Remember, as you make your plans, that although South Africa is stable, not all neighbouring countries are.
The requirements and costs of a visa vary from country to country and depend on the country from which you come.
Each country has its own laws, which specify which emergency articles must physically exist in the machine.
Victoria Falls is a settlement on the west side of Zimbabwe, on the other side of the border with Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The city is located right next to the waterfalls and these are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers both adventure seekers and those who visit the sights a lot of opportunities for a longer stay.
During the rain season (November-March), the volume of water increases, and the waterfall looks more impressive.
Surely you will get wet if you cross the bridge or follow the winding paths near the waterfalls.
On the other hand, it is precisely the large volume of water that is the reason why the waterfall itself is hidden from sight – water hides it!
The tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 is perhaps the most famous of the valley tombs, the place where Howard Carter discovered the king's tomb almost intact in 1922.
However, compared to most other royal tombs, Tutankhamun's tomb hardly deserves to be visited, being much smaller and with relatively few decorations.
Anyone who wishes to see traces of damage to the mummy during attempts to remove it from the sarcophagus will be disappointed, because only the head and shoulders are visible.
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer in it, but have been displaced to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
Visitors without much time available would be better to spend their time elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap. This temple on top of a hill was built at the end of the 9th century during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The dark air of the temple and the view of Lake Tonle Sap make the climb of the hill worth the effort.
A spot visit can conveniently be combined with a boat ride to the lake.
Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple, so do not forget to take your passport with you when you go to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and the largest city of the country, although most countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as the capital of Israel.
The ancient city of the Hills of Judea has a fascinating history that spans thousands of years.
It is a holy city for the three monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Due to the religious significance of the city and in particular the numerous sights in the old city area, Jerusalem is one of the main tourist destinations in Israel.
Jerusalem has many historical, archaeological and cultural sites, as well as busy and lively shopping centers, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires the citizens of Cuba to receive an invitation letter before entering Ecuador using international airports or border crossings.
This letter must be legalised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador and must comply with certain requirements.
These requirements are designed to ensure a well-organised movement between the two countries.
Cuban citizens holding green cards for the US must visit an Ecuadorian consulate in order to obtain an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the date of the trip. A round trip/return ticket is required to prove the duration of your stay.
Tours cost less for larger groups, so if you are alone or accompanied by one friend, try to join others to form a group of four to six people, thus benefiting from a better price per person.
You should not worry too much, however, because tourists are often moved around to fill the coaches.
It seems to be more of a trick to make people think they have to pay more.
You can see this steep mountain, which often appears in the distant plane of the photographs of the ruins, rising above the northern part of Machu Picchu.
It looks discouraging from below, and it represents a steep and difficult ascent, but most of those with reasonably good physical condition should succeed in about 45 minutes.
Stone steps are located along the largest part of the path, and a steel wire bar is installed in the steeper sections.
That being said, wait for your breath to be taken away and watch out for the steeper portions, especially when they are wet, as they can quickly become dangerous.
Near the summit there is a small cave that needs to be crossed, rather low and rather tight.
Seats and wildlife in Galapagos can best be seen from a craft, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
Over 60 cruise ships sail in the waters of the Galapagos archipelago, ranging in capacity between 8 and 100 passengers.
Most people make reservations long before (since boats are usually busy in the middle of the season).
Make sure your booking agent specializes in the Galapagos Islands and knows a wide range of ships.
This will ensure that your interests and/or limitations are associated with the ship most suitable for them.
Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the Inca Empire, while the indigenous Araucanians (mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
Mapuche was also one of the last independent groups of Native Americans, so they were not fully assimilated by the Spanish-speaking majority until Chile gained independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (during the Napoleonic War that left Spain without a functioning central government for a period of several years), a decisive victory against Spain was not achieved until 1818.
The Dominican Republic () is a country in the Caribbean that occupies the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
Besides white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, the country also hosts the oldest European city in the Americas, now part of Santo Domingo.
The island was for the first time inhabited by the Taino and the Caribii. Caribii were a population that spoke the Arawak language, which had arrived about 10,000 B.C.E.
Just a few years after the arrival of European explorers, the population of Tainos had been significantly reduced by Spanish conquistadors.
Based on Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Treaty of the Indies), between 1492 and 1498 Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 Taino Native Americans.
This space was built as an atrium for a 17th century monastery, from which only the San Diego Temple building was preserved.
Now it's used as a central market and it's a place of intense activity, day and night.
A number of restaurants surround the garden, and free concerts often take place in the afternoon and evening, using the central kiosk as a stage.
Callejon del Beso (Kiss Alley). Two balconies just 69 centimeters away are home to an old love story.
For a few pennies, some kids will tell you the story.
Bowen Island is a popular day or weekend trip that offers rowing, hiking, shops, restaurants and more.
This genuine community is located in Howe Sound, near Vancouver, where it can easily be reached using fixed-time water taxis leaving Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
Those who like outdoor activities should not miss the opportunity to take a hike in Sea-to-Sky County.
Whistler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is an expensive place, but has won fame thanks to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
In winter enjoy some of the best ski slopes in North America, and in summer try authentic mountain biking.
For permits you must book beforehand. You need a permit to stay overnight at the Mermaid.
The mermaid is the only ranger resort that, besides camping, offers rooms and a hot meal. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos offer only camping facilities without food services.
Access to the park can be obtained directly from the Puerto Jiménez security post, but card payment is not accepted
The Park Service (MINAE) shall not issue permits for visiting the park more than one month before the date of arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for a fee of 30 US dollars, or $10 for one day's permits; details on their Corcovado page.
Cook Islands are an island country associated as a free state with New Zealand, located in Polynesia, in the middle of the South Pacific.
It is an archipelago consisting of 15 islands, which extend over 2.2 km2 of ocean.
"Being on the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes called «The Low Hawaiians»."
Even though it's smaller, it reminds visitors of Hawaii before it became a state, without the big hotels for tourists and other developments.
Cook Islands have no city, but consist of 15 different islands. The most important are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
Today, in developed countries, the luxury half board offer has become a kind of art form.
After all, it is obvious that pensions compete at two things mainly: accommodation and breakfast.
Therefore, in the most refined of these units, customers get sumptuous sheets, which may include handmade covers or old beds.
Breakfast may include regional seasonal treats or host speciality.
The scene could be an old historic building with old furniture, neat lands and a swimming pool.
Taking your own car and making a long journey has an intrinsic charm in its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you are probably already used to driving your own car and you know its limits.
Lifting a tent on private ground or in a settlement of any size may attract unwanted attention.
"In short, the car is an ideal vehicle to go on a journey, but rarely a way to «campa»."
It is possible to camp with the car if you have a large van, SUV, sedan or break with seats that fold on the back.
A few hotels have a legacy from the glorious age of steam railways and shipping; since before World War II, in the 19th century and early 20th century.
These hotels accommodated the wealthy and famous of the time and often had a refined kitchen and nightlife.
Old-fashioned accessories, lack of modern facilities and a certain graceful seniority are also part of their nature.
Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes host visiting heads of state as well as other dignitaries.
A traveler with a lot of money can consider flying around the world, interrupted by stays in many of these hotels.
A hospitality exchange network is an organization that connects travelers with locals in the cities they are to visit.
Enrolment in such a network usually only requires the completion of an online form; although some networks provide or require additional verifications.
Thereafter, a list of available, printed and/or online accommodation offers is compiled, which sometimes includes tourist references and comments.
Couchsurfing appeared in January 2004, after programmer Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland, but had no place to live.
He sent e-mails to students from the local university and received an overwhelming number of free accommodation offers.
Inns provide services primarily to young people - a typical guest is one around the age of twenty - but you can, by the way, quite often find and travel older.
Families with children are rare, but some hostels allow them access to private rooms.
Beijing in China will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, which will make it the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Beijing will host opening and closing ceremonies, as well as ice events in covered spaces.
Other ski events will take place at the ski resort in Taizicheng in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples organize a festival between the end of November and mid-May, the exact date varying according to the annual calendar of each temple.
Most temple festivals are celebrated on the anniversary of the temple, on the birthday of the deity to which it is dedicated or any other major events associated with the temple.
The Kerala temple festivals are very interesting to watch, with an ordinary procession of decorated elephants, temple orchestra and other festivities.
A World's Fair (often called the World Exhibition, or simply the Expo) is a great international festival of art and science.
Participating countries present artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to present world problems or their country's culture and history.
International horticultural exhibitions are specialized events in which floral arrangements, botanical gardens and anything else related to plants are presented.
Although, theoretically, it can take place annually (as long as it takes place in different countries), it does not happen in practice.
As a rule, the duration of the events is between three and six months, taking place on areas that extend over at least 50 hectares.
There are many different film formats that have been used over the years. The standard 35 mm film (negative 36 per 24 mm) is the most common of them.
Normally, it can be refuelled quite easily if it ends and provides a resolution comparable to approximately an actual DSLR.
Some cameras that have an average format use a 6 x 6 cm format, to be exact, a 56 x 56 mm negative.
This gives resolution almost four times that of a 35 mm (3136 mm2 versus 864) negative.
Wild animals are among the most difficult topics for a photographer, who needs a combination of good luck, patience, experience and good equipment.
Photography of wild animals is often treated as something of little value but, as for photography in general, an image is worth a thousand words.
A long teleobjective is often needed to photograph animals, although other objectives are required for subjects such as a flock of birds or a tiny creature.
Many exotic animals are hard to find, and sometimes parks have rules about taking commercial photos.
Wild animals can be either shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
There are over 5,000 different languages in the world, including more than twenty with over 50 million speakers.
The written word is often easier to understand than the spoken word. This is all the more true in the case of addresses, which are often difficult to pronounce clearly.
In many countries the entire population speaks fluent English and in even more you can expect a limited knowledge of it – especially among young people.
Imagine, please, a citizen from Manchester, one from Boston, one from Jamaica and another from Sydney, sitting around a table, having dinner at a restaurant in Toronto.
They support stories from their hometowns, reported using distinct accents and the lingo of the place.
Buying food at the supermarket is usually the cheapest way to get food, but without the possibility to cook, our choices are limited to ready food.
More and more supermarkets have more varied districts of ready food. Some even offer access to microwave ovens or other ways to heat food.
In some countries or types of shops, there is at least one local restaurant, often a rather informal one, with affordable prices.
Make copies of the insurer’s policies and contact details and take them to you.
They must show the insurer’s e-mail address and international telephone numbers for advice/authorisations and complaints.
‘Keep another copy on yourself or online (attached in an email sent to your own address or stored in “cloud”).’
If you are travelling with a laptop or tablet, save a copy to its memory or disk (accessible without Internet connection).
Also provide copies of contacting policies/data to those accompanying you on your journey and to relatives or friends at home willing to help.
The moose (also known as the elk) is not inherently aggressive, but it will defend itself if it perceives a threat.
If people don't think the moose are potentially dangerous, they might get too close and put themselves in risky situations.
Drink alcohol with moderation. Alcohol affects each of us differently and it is important to know your limits.
Possible long-term health effects due to excessive drinking can include liver damage and even loss of vision and death. The potential danger increases when drinking illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal spirits may contain various dangerous impurities, including methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses can cost less in another country, especially in low-income countries where labour costs are lower.
Consider the option of doing an ocular exam at home, especially if it is covered by insurance, taking the prescription with you to deposit it elsewhere.
The frames available in such areas can have two problems; some can be imitations, and the real and imported ones could be more expensive than at home.
Coffee is one of the most commercial goods in the world and you can certainly find many types in the area where you live.
However, in the world there are many different ways to drink coffee that deserve to be tried.
Canyoning (or canyoneering) means exploring the bottom of a canyon, which is either dry or filled with water.
Canyoning combines swimming, climbing and jumping elements, but to begin with it does not require intense training or an enviable physical form (compared to climbing, diving or climbing skiing, for example).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that involves walking in natural areas, often following marked paths.
In the case of day hiking we are talking about distances that range from less than a mile to longer distances, but can be covered in one day.
For a one-day hike on a light path, the necessary preparations are few and any person in moderate form can enjoy the experience.
Families with young children may need to prepare more, but an outdoor day can be easily organised even when it includes infants and preschoolers.
At international level, there are almost 200 organizations for running tournaments. Most operate independently.
Go Running Tours, who succeeded Global Running Tours, connects dozens of trail suppliers on four continents.
With its origin in Barcelona racing and Copenhagen racing in Copenhagen, it was quickly expanded with Prague racing, held in Prague, along with other events.
There are many things to consider before and during the journey to a particular destination.
“When traveling, expect it to be different from “home”. Good manners, laws, food, circulation, accommodation, rules, language and so on will be somewhat different from those on your sides.”
You must always keep this in mind to avoid being disappointed or even disgusted with the skills of the place.
Travel agencies have already existed since the 19th century. A travel agent is usually a good option for a journey outside the previous experience of a traveler in terms of natural environment, culture, language, or low income countries.
Although most agencies accept the most common types of reservations, many agencies specialize in certain types of trips, budget limits or destinations.
Perhaps it would be better to use an agent who makes frequent reservations for trips like yours.
Take a look at the trips the agent is promoting, on a website or on a store window.
If you want to see the world at a low price, out of necessity, lifestyle or as a challenge, there are a few ways to do that.
In short, they are divided into two categories: either you work while traveling, or you try to limit your spending. This article focuses on the latter.
For those who are willing to sacrifice from personal comfort, from time to time and from the probability of lowering expenses to close to 0, they can consult the minimum budget for travel.
The advice is based on the assumption that travellers do not steal, break the law, participate in the black market, beg or exploit other people for their own purposes.
Immigration control is usually the first place to stop after landing from the plane, ship or other vehicle.
On some cross-border trains, inspections are carried out on a moving train and you must carry with you a valid identity document when embarking on one of them.
On bunk trains, passports can be collected by the conductor so that you do not have to stop sleeping.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you need to register your presence and address where you live with local authorities.
This may require the completion of a form with local police or a visit to immigration offices.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels will handle the registration (make sure you ask).
In other situations, only those who stay outside the tourist accommodation areas must register. However, it is a detail that makes the law much more unclear, so inform yourself in advance.
Architecture deals with the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place often constitutes a tourist attraction itself.
Many buildings are very beautiful, and the view offered by a tall building or an ingeniously positioned window can, in turn, charm the gaze.
Architecture overlaps considerably with other fields, including urban planning, civil engineering, decorative arts, interior design and landscape design.
Given how isolated many of the villages are, you will not be able to find much nightlife without going to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all the casinos listed above serve drinks and some of them provide quality entertainment (especially the large ones, in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Attention: Small city bars here are not always the best place for a visitor from outside the state to spend time.
First, North New Mexico has significant problems with driving under the influence of alcoholic beverages, and the proportion of drunk drivers is high compared to small city bars.
Unwanted paintings or scribbles on walls are known as graffiti.
Although it is nowhere near a recent phenomenon, most probably correlate it with teenagers who vandalize public and private properties using spray paint.
“However, nowadays, there are dedicated graffiti artists, graffiti events and “legal walls.” Graphite paintings, in this context, often resemble works of art rather than illegible distinguishing marks.”
Throwing the boomerang is a popular skill that many tourists want to acquire.
If you want to learn to throw a boomerang that will return to your hand, make sure you have a boomerang suitable for your return.
Most boomerangs available in Australia actually do not return to the launch point. For beginners it is advisable not to try to launch them under wind conditions.
A Hangi-style dish is prepared using a hot hole.
In some places the pit is heated with hot stones, and in other parts the geothermal heat makes some areas of the soil naturally warm.
Hangi is often used to cook a traditional steak dinner.
Several places in Rotorua offer geotermantic innkeepers, and other types of innkeepers can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail offers two classes on Cape Town shuttle trains and its surroundings: MetroPlus (or first class) and Metro (or third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but something more expensive, though it is cheaper than regular metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and Metro wagons; MetroPlus wagons are always at the rear of the train, the closest to Cape Town.
Roadway - Never leave your luggage unattended, especially when crossing the border.
You could wake up that you're being used without your knowledge to carry drugs, which will cause you a lot of trouble.
This includes waiting in line because dogs that detect drugs can be used at any time without notice.
Some countries have extremely draconian penalties even for the first offenses; these may include prison sentences of more than 10 years or death.
Unattended bags are a target for thieves and can also attract the attention of authorities afraid of bomb threats.
At home, due to constant exposure to local microbes, the chances of being already immune to them are very high.
In other parts of the world, however, where bacteria are not familiar, you are more likely to have problems.
Also, in warmer climates bacteria multiply faster and survive for longer outside the body.
And from there the misfortunes of Delhi's belly, of Pharaoh's curse, of Montezuma's vengeance, along with their many friends.
As with respiratory problems in colder climates, intestinal problems in warmer climates are quite common and, in most cases, are clearly disturbing but not very dangerous.
Who travels for the first time in a developing country – or in a part of the new world for them – must not underestimate the potential for cultural shock.
Many experienced and capable travellers have been overwhelmed by the news of travel in developing countries, where a lot of small cultural differences are rapidly gathering.
Especially in the early days, it would be good to indulge in hotels, food and services in style and Western quality standards to help you adapt.
Do not sleep on a mattress or mat on the floor in places where you are not familiar with the local fauna.
If you'll camp, take a folding bed or a hammock to protect yourself from snakes, scorpions and others.
Fill your house with a tasty morning coffee flavor and relaxing camomile tea in the evening.
When you stay indoors, you have time to enjoy yourself and allow yourself a few extra minutes to prepare a special meal.
If you're in the mood for adventure, take the opportunity to make a soda or mix some smoothies:
Maybe you'll discover a simple drink that you can make for breakfast after you go back to your everyday life.
If you live in a city with a varied drinking culture, go to bars and pubs in neighborhoods you do not attend.
For those unfamiliar with medical jargon, infectious and contagious words have distinct meanings.
An infectious disease is caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, a bacterium, a fungus or other parasites.
A contagious disease is a mildly transmissible disease near an infected person.
Many governments provide that when visitors enter or residents leave their countries, they will be vaccinated for a number of diseases.
These requirements may often depend on the countries a traveller has visited or intends to visit.
One of the strong points of Charlotte, North Carolina, is that it abounds in high-quality options for families.
Residents from other areas often mention the family-friendly atmosphere as the main reason they moved there, and visitors often say they can enjoy the city with children.
In the last 20 years, the number of suitable options for children in Uptown Charlotte has increased exponentially.
Taxis are generally not used by Charlotte’s families, although they may be of some use under certain circumstances.
There is a surcharge for more than 2 passengers, so this option might prove to be more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica, located around the South Pole, is the coldest place on earth.
Tourist visits are expensive, require a good physical condition, can only be undertaken in summer between November and February, and are largely limited to the Peninsula, Islands and Ross Sea.
Several thousand employees live here during the summer, in four dozen bases, mostly in those areas; few of them remain over the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is an arid plateau, covered by an ice layer of 2-3 km thick.
Specialised aerial voyages are occasionally organized to the interior of the continent, for climbing or to reach the Pole, where there is a large base.
Crossing the South Pole (or Highway) is a 1600 km road from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pol.
It consists of compact snow, with crevasses filled and marked with flags. It can only be crossed by specialized tractors, which draw the sleds with fuel and supplies.
They are not particularly agile, so to reach the plateau, the route must make a wide detour around the Transantarctic Mountains.
In winter, the most common causes of accidents are slippery roads, sidewalks (pavement) and especially stairs.
As a minimum preparation, you need shoes with the right soles. Summer footwear usually slips very hard on ice and snow, even some winter boots are deficient.
The model shall be sufficiently deep, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more and the material shall be sufficiently soft at low temperatures.
Some boots have cramps and there is additional equipment used for slippery conditions, suitable for most shoes and boots, or for heels and soles.
The heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered on roads or paths to increase traction.
Avalanches are not an anomaly; steep slopes have a limit on the amount of snow they can withstand, and excess volumes will descend in the form of avalanches.
The problem is that snow is clinging, so it needs a trigger factor to fall, and part of the snow that comes down can trigger the fall of the remaining one.
Sometimes the initial trigger event is the heat of the snow by the sun, sometimes new snows, and sometimes different types of natural events or often human intervention.
A tornado is a very low pressure air column that rotates and sucks the ambient air inwards and upwards.
They give rise to strong winds (often 100-200 miles per hour) and can lift massive objects into the air, which they move with the movement of the tornado.
"I take birth as a kind of funnel that descends from storm clouds, turning into "turnnades" at the touch of the ground."
Personal VPN service providers (virtual private network) are an excellent way to avoid both political censorship and geofiltration of IPs for commercial purposes.
These are for more reasons than a web proxy: they redirect all internet traffic, not just the Internet protocol.
Usually, using these you have a higher bandwidth and better quality services. They are encoded, thus being harder to intercept.
"Media companies typically lie about the purposes of the measure, pretending to be to "prevent piracy."
In fact, regional codes have no effect on illegal copying; a bit-by-bit copy of the disk can be used without problems on any device on which the original works.
The actual goal is to give these companies more control over their market; everything is related to the circulation of money.
Because calls are directed on the Internet, you do not need to use a telephone company with your home or your travel headquarters.
You also don't need to get a number from your community; you can get a satellite Internet connection in the middle of the forest in Chicken, Alaska, and you can choose a number that says you're in sunny Arizona.
You often need to buy a global number separately, which allows you to be called from PSTN phones. From where the number is is a relevant detail for those who call you.
Real-time text translation applications - applications capable of automatically translating whole portions of text from one language to another.
Some applications in this category even offer the possibility to translate texts into foreign languages or signs or other objects in the real world when the user points the smart phone at those objects.
Translation engines have had spectacular improvements, and now they often provide fairly correct translations (and less rarely meaningless tests), but it is advisable to be cautious, because the translation is still possible to be completely wrong.
One of the most prominent applications in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading the language information you want.
Using the GPS navigation app on your phone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when you are in a foreign country.
It can save money instead of buying new maps for a GPS, or an independent GPS device, or renting one from a car rental company.
If you do not have a data connection on your phone or when you are off the grid, their performance may be limited or unavailable.
A chaotic range of prepaid phone cards can be found in all shops in the corner, which can be used with public phones or regular phones.
While most cards can be used to call anywhere, some are dedicated to offering favourable rates to certain groups of countries.
Access to these services is often made through a free phone number that can be called free of charge from most phones.
The rules for ordinary photography may apply even more to video recordings.
If shooting something is not allowed, you shouldn't even think about filming.
If you are using a drone, make sure you are allowed to film and what additional permits or licenses are required.
Piloting a drone near an airport or above a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it's not illegal in your area.
Nowadays, for air travel, travelers rarely make direct reservations to the airline, without pre-searching and comparing prices.
Sometimes the same flight can have much different prices for various aggregation services and is worth the time invested, before making the reservation, to compare the search results, along with a search on the airline website itself.
Although you may not need a visa in case of tourist or short business visits to other countries, a visit as an international student usually involves a longer stay than in the case of a regular tourist.
In general, in order to stay in another country for a longer period of time you will need to obtain a visa in advance.
Study visas generally have requirements and application procedures different from regular, tourist or business visas.
In most countries, you will need an offer letter from the institution you want to study, as well as proof of sufficient funds to support you in at least the first year of your course.
See the institution, as well as the immigration department, about the country where you want to study for detailed requirements.
If you are not diplomatic staff, if you are working in another country, you must file your income statement in the country where you are domiciled.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and rates and categories of taxation differ widely from country to country.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied on both federal and local levels, so rates and taxable income may vary from one region to another.
Verification of immigration is usually completely absent or just a formality when you return to your country of origin, but customs control can be a nuisance.
Make sure you know what you can and cannot bring and that you declare everything that goes beyond the legal limits.
The easiest way to start writing travel reviews is to improve your skills on a well-known travel blog site.
Once you are familiar with web formatting and editing, you can then create your own website.
Volunteering during the trip is an excellent way to change things, but it's not just about offering something.
Living and volunteering in a foreign country are good ways to get to know a different culture, to get to know new people, to learn about yourself, to acquire an overview and even to master new skills.
It can also be a good way to extend the budget to allow a longer stay somewhere, since many voluntary services provide accommodation and food, and a few pay a small salary.
Vikings have used Russian waterways to get from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. Parts of these routes can still be used. Check that you do not need special permits, which may be difficult to obtain.
The White Channel - Baltic Sea connects the Arctic Ocean with the Baltic Sea through Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mostly through rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so it is still possible to reach Russia through the Caspian Sea.
Be sure that once you get to the marinas everything will be clear. You will meet other hitchhikers by boat and they will share your information.
Basically, you will post notifications offering your help, walking on the docks, addressing people who clean their yachts, trying to get in touch with sailors at the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while, everyone will know you and give you tips on what boat is looking for someone.
You should carefully choose the airline of the alliance-related loyalty programme.
Even if you tend to join the airline you use most often, you should bear in mind that the privileges are often different and frequent flight points can bring you more generous benefits to another airline in the same alliance.
Airlines, such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines, have significantly expanded their flights to Africa and offer links to many large African cities at affordable prices, unlike other European airlines.
Since 2014, Turkish Airlines has been racing to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra time to travel, check the total price of the ticket to Africa compared to the price of a ticket around the world.
Remember to add additional costs for additional visas departure fees, public transport, etc., for all those places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world only in the southern hemisphere, the selection of flights and destinations is limited, due to the lack of transocean routes.
No airline alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the southern hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not cover any of these crossings).
However, the Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern area of the South Pacific, from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a flight operated by LATAM Oneworld.
This flight is not the only option if you want to avoid the South Pacific and the west coast of South America. (see below)
In 1994, the ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan declared war on the Azerbaijani.
With support from Armenia, a new republic has been created. However, no existing nation – not even Armenia – officially recognises it.
Diplomatic disputes over the region continue to disrupt relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Canal District () is the name of the famous 17th century district around the Binnenstad area in Amsterdam.
The entire district is designated UNESCO World Heritage due to its special cultural and historical value, and the prices of real estate here are among the most expensive in the whole country.
Cinque Terre, which means Five Lands, comprises the five small coastal villages, Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso, located in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, people have carefully built terraces on rough and steep terrain, leading up to the cliffs overlooking the sea.
Part of its charm is the absence of visible corporate development. Villages communicate with each other through paths, trains and boats, and the car cannot be penetrated from outside the area.
The French dialects spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are a bit different from French spoken in France, although they are similar enough for people to understand each other.
In particular, the system of counting in French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland has some small features that differ from French spoken in France, and the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.
That being said, all Belgians and Swiss speaking French have learned standard French at school, so they will understand you even if you use the usual French counting system.
"In many parts of the world, waving is a friendly gesture, used to salute."
"In Malaysia, however, at least among the inhabitants of rural areas, it has the meaning of 'come here', similar to the gesture of bending the index finger to the body used in some Western countries, and should only be used for that purpose."
Similarly, a British traveler in Spain may mistake a goodbye greeting involving the palm of the hand aimed at the waver (rather than the person being waved) as a gesture to return.
Auxiliaries are artificial or constructed languages, created with the intention of facilitating communication between peoples who would otherwise encounter difficulties in communicating.
They are separated by lingua francas, which are natural or organic languages, which become dominant for one reason or another as a means of communicating between the speakers of other languages.
Day, on heat, travelers can fall prey to the mirages that produce the illusion of water (or other phenomena) on the horizon.
They can become dangerous when the traveler tracks the mirages, wasting his remaining energy and water.
Even the hottest deserts can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia poses a real threat in the absence of warm clothing.
In summer, in particular, you will have to watch out for mosquitoes, if you decide to take a route through the rain forest.
Even if you walk through the subtropical forest in the car, a few seconds with the door open when you get in the car is enough for mosquitoes to accompany you inside.
Avian influenza, also called bird flu, can infect both birds and mammals.
Less than a thousand cases were observed in humans, but some of them proved fatal.
Most have involved people working with poultry, but there is a level of risk for bird observers as well.
Typical for Norvagia are the steep fjords and valleys that suddenly end in a high plateau, quite uniform.
These plateaus are often referred to as "videos", meaning a large space free of trees, an endless expanse.
In Rogaland and Agder they are usually called "hei", which designates a deforested and uncultivated area, often covered with bushes.
Glaciers are not stable, but they slide down the mountain slope. This leads to cracks and crevasses that can be masked by snow bridges.
The walls and roofs of the ice caves can collapse and the cracks can close.
At the edges of the glaciers, huge pieces come apart, fall down and can jump or roll further away from the edge.
The tourist season for hill stations generally rises during the Indian summer.
However, they have another type of beauty and charm in winter, many hill stations benefiting from serious amounts of snow and offering activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
Only a few airlines still offer death prices, which make a small reduction in the cost of the last hour trip for a funeral.
The airlines that include these services are Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa, for flights from USA or Canada, and WestJet.
In all cases, you have to make the reservation by phone directly to the airline.
