Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they might give the impression that they are "marionettes"
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed because they have been suggested to change their title, namely to be called MWP (members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Wales Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that "it is with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "faecal matter".
A member of the Wales Party of the National Assembly of Wales said that overall, the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternatives.
One member of the Conservative Party said the group had a "open" attitude towards changing the name, but also noted that "MWP" resembles "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales like the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on how the Assembly members are appointed will certainly depend on the members themselves."
The Law of 2017 on the Government of Wales gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the "Gales Parliament".
As regards the title of members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred "members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the option "MWP" received the most votes in the public consultation.
It seems that members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could give Elin Jones, chairman of the board, who is expected to send the draft amendment bill within weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will have the last word on their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote for referendum on change of country name
This Sunday, citizens with voting rights will voice their views on changing their country's name to "North Macedonia Republic".
The popular vote was held to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens government has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would disregard the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is just a compromise that will allow him to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Episcopal Church have stopped ringing as a result of the problems facing the churches of Harlem
"Historically, the veterans of the place I talked to told me that before, you found a bar and a church on every street corner," Adams said.
"Today, there are no bars and no churches."
He also said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he said.
"Bars no longer have the role of living room for the whole neighborhood, where people usually gather."
And as far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of the goods will be spent faster than the leaders expect, and that " sooner or later, the outcome will be the same".
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who would not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy the condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "therefore, this will speed up the closing of churches, because it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of the respective churches."
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, consisting of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African-Americans, carrying out their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by an African-American congregation, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted 125th Street merchants, a main shopping street in Harlem, which opposed hiring or promoting African-Americans.
A fire that occurred in 1939 greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it and included the carilon in it.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's church, called the carilon "the bells of poor people".
The expert who put the carilon into operation in July described it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that he was the first carilon in the world by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to a larger carilon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story, including architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by Episcopal Diocese.
The sacristy, the governing entity of the parish, made up of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the sacristy, even though it was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained about the lack of transparency shown by the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old who was trying to catch lobsters in California
According to authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while he was swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a little boy screaming for help and then moved along with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel also stated that he initially thought that the boy was delighted that he had caught a lobster, but then realized that he was shouting, "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole clavicle was torn apart, Hammel said he noticed it when he reached the boy.
"I cried out to all those who were in the water and told them to come out of the water: "There is a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a shark species that poses a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper torso.
the authorities restricted access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles also noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury retailer plans to strengthen its position on UK beauty and fashion products market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing districts with beauty products in the style of a department store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a consolidation of position on the UK beauty products market, worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow, although sales of domestic and fashion products are not suitable, larger beauty districts will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into several stores in the next year, if they prove successful.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in a context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for TVs, microwaves and household products.
Representatives of the Sainsbury retailer stated that the number of beauty products they offer will be doubled, up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPaw.
The existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of make-up products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegans, an increasingly common demand among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two Sainsbury chain stores for testing purposes, the first being the one opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second in Shelly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller quantities of food every day at the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sainsbury retailer, said the outlets would increasingly look like department stores, as supermarket chains are trying to cope with the fight against large discount shops, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury has included both products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores and Habitats since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means it has seen increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The supermarket's previous attempt to refresh its compartments of pharmaceuticals and beauty has failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ended after a divergence in how to split Boots' revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business that included 281 stores, to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding a wide range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury retailer, said: "We have transformed the appearance of our districts with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations turn us into an extraordinary location to buy beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million-pound contract.
The protagonist of the TV show "Dragons' Den", Peter Jones, is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to get involved in their True brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
Presenter of the 37-year-old "This Morning" announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby generated the anger of Peter Jones, the protagonist of "Dragons‘ Den", withdrawing at the last minute from their lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones reportedly got angry when one of the most beloved television people admitted Tuesday, during a tense sitting at his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, no longer allow him to dedicate himself to their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and household items.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would almost have doubled Willoughby's fortune with an estimated 11 million pounds.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he would give up his contract for Truly, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his vacation homes.
The statement of one source: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It would be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to retire shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was just before the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the presenter of "This Morning", which is among the best-selling celebrities in the UK, could harm the company millions, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible further delay in launching.
It can also represent the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S Ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A close source of Jones said last night: "We do not want to comment on his affairs."
I was really tough, and then "we fell in love"
He made jokes about the criticism he would receive from journalists because he made a comment some would consider "not worthy of a president" and that he has such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
He said Trump was imitating a voice as a "newscaster".
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as an enormous step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearisation have ceased.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a "appropriate response" from the United States regarding the previous disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic point of view in his motivational speech.
"Everything is going well with regard to North Korea," he said.
"We were going to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the return of US military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but if I acted like this, instead of the 10,000 people outside, who are trying to enter this small arena, there would be about 200 people," Trump said, pointing to the crowd that was in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia ravaged an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that their aid was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population has been deployed, a national disaster has not been declared, a condition needed to trigger relief actions at international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit of a difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutovo, the spokesman for the Agency for National Disasters, said Indonesia's authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to aid efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes borne by Indonesia, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be insufficiently prepared for nature's anger.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not very common on other ribs.
It seems that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning has been issued, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under the best of circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia turns out to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this even more.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo has set out to improve the poor infrastructure in Indonesia to be the focus of his election campaign and has allocated more money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds affected Joko's administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from sectants in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands dislocated from their homes, as gangs of Christians and Muslims clashed on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge de la Liverpool gives the saver goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat in front of Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge football stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while about 30 metres from the opposing team gate, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a shot in the direction of the gate.
The ball reached the top of the square, heading to the upper right corner of the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped at her and fell into the goal.
"I just had to try to get in the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to move as far as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think very much about it, I just took the ball away."
Chelsea drove 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue team's striker sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then he turned into the middle of the field and ran to Liverpool's half-field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who came in.
Hazard overcame the defense and sent the ball into the net, managing to hit it with his left foot and pass Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against Naples in the League of Champions group phase at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Number of deaths caused by tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, on Sunday morning.
Several people were trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and triggered waves of up to 6 metres, the agency's spokesman, Sutovo Purwo Nugroho, said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000 people, has been covered by debris caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of stabbing a woman.
A murder investigation was started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen something about it to come to the station for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I appeal to all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful materials with the help of the camera on board to contact us if they have information essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a woman in Birkenhead and was found on property.
This afternoon, a few people came to the crime scene who think they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police have said they are trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by the police that no one was allowed into the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
People living in the building were told it would take a few more hours before they were allowed in.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene, there was a woman in tears.
He kept repeating, "It's so awful!"
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the perimeter and another van was outside.
Several police officers were standing in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to police @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at phone number 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by the altercations on "rewriting history"
Its removal would be poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many religious and cultural artifacts of England by its fanatical Puritan descendants.
But Cromwell described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell, said: “It was inevitable in the present debate about removing statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas from the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation, this is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
But certainly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, which represents part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
A pig caused the death of a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media agencies.
The man, identified only by his last name "Yuan", was found dead after a artery was severed and covered in blood near a pig farm in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, according to the Sunday editorial of Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai province of China.
Apparently, he came with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a neighboring coop was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the henhouse with blood on his mouth.
Forensics confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and slit," the cousin, whose last name is "Wu", told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was imprisoned to prevent him from attacking someone else, while police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It seems that Yuan's family and the authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs have been reported that have attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
10 years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that blood taste can trigger such reactions."
"It's just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, who has lost her strength, will cause torrential rains in the southwest of the United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as she moves to colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States over the next few days.
Rosa recorded wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a category 1 hurricane from Sunday at 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression zone has begun to form across the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push the intense tropical humidity from the north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rainfall up to 25 cm into some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity that will interact with the depression zone will generate heavy rains in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid floods, waste streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rain is expected between 5 and 10 cm in the southwest, especially in most Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to conditions of rapid deterioration due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rain could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into gusts and dust.
The nearing depression zone will bring torrential rains to areas on the southern coast of California.
Rains of almost 2 cm are possible, which could lead to minor flows of residues and slippery roads.
These will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on the second part of Sunday and the first part of Monday, before the rain spreads more Monday night and Tuesday.
Intense precipitations will spread to the so-called "four corners" on Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature changes in the US, as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are found at the level of the central area of the US.
There is a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern part of the US is expected to face a warm beginning of October, with temperatures up to 27 degrees in large areas, from the southern plains to certain parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, the city of New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a high probability of temperatures above average for the eastern US by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the press statement supported by the supreme court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, as TV stations interrupted Friday's normal programme for breaking news: an agreement reached between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford told the court that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh harassed her while he was drunk and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said he was 100% sure this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that submitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who watch from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in the play-offs or Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the daily hearing.
ABC was second with a number of viewers of 3.26 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS was watched by 3.1 million people, NBC of 2.94 million, MSNBC of 2.89 million and CNN of 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning while protestors were shouting at him and he was trying to get on an elevator to a meeting of the Judicial Committee.
He looked down for a few minutes while people scolded him, and it was all broadcast live on CNN.
"I am right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling us the truth?
He was told, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed, he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions later broadcast the vote to the Judicial Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate's vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to consider the charges against the nominee next week, which the minority Democrats demanded.
Flake was largely convinced of conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards.
Flake's choice was important, and the Republicans would obviously not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "political games" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of Great Britain, attended the conservative party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview accompanied by his photo on the front page of the newspaper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on her plan for Brexit, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect their tariffs was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims's shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of shooting the LSU player to death
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned, charged with second-degree murder according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the skirmish.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the WAFB, affiliated to CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde to death.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Bureau of Legal Medicine Baton Rouge published a preliminary report Friday, saying that the death was caused by a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The department gives credit to the Louisiana police force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for the aid provided in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
LSU's athletic director, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for their "diligence and search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 m-high striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano threw an ash column over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the citizens of Mexico on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after the activity was triggered in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Centre was monitoring several rumblings and vibrations.
Social networking images showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increase in the activity of the volcano which lies 72 km southeast of the capital after an earthquake of 7.1 magnitude shook the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote, gathering thousands of opposing demonstrators.
A group of pro-separatists masked away by the gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The skirmish later intensified, with police using their sticks to control the situation.
For several hours, the pro-independence groups chanted, "We do not forget, we do not forgive", while the Union protestors shouted, "Long live Spain!".
14 people received medical attention for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants to become independent one year after the referendum on 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose, in an overwhelming majority, to become independent, although turnout was low and those against secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region, with violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes for Catalonia's independence.
“Last year I had some of the best moments of my life.
I watched my parents cry for joy that I could vote, but now there is nothing we can do," he said.
Despite a vital but close victory in the December regional elections last year, the pro-independent Catalan parties tried to maintain momentum this year, with many of the best known leaders either in their own exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police protest on his phone, said politicians on both sides fuelled the conflict.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison at the end of last year, announced he would run for European Parliament elections next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to denounce regression in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Several men were arrested after driving into a house
Three men, 33, 34, and 39, were arrested after a car broke into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and even the building.
It seems that at some point a crossbow was used against the car.
Menga's hit helped the Livingston team win 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers unanswered, with Steven Gerrard reaching his second 18-game defeat as manager of the club Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's strike proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played on the same level as the Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team runs out of an away win in the Premier League this season and faces Hearts leaders with eight points behind them next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the division until six matches, with Holt's lead coach still tasting defeat because he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Misses His Chance Against Cruel Visitors
Holt's team should have moved forward long before they scored, and their orientation caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break in and try to shoot through the gate space, then Alan Lithgow managed to shoot wide after he slipped in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make trouble for visitors at free kicks.
And that was how the crucial goal came.
The Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston managed an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to care about Menga, who shot and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated possession, but faced impenetrable host defenses, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was no longer in great distress during the rest of the match.
This game model continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Allan McGregor of the Rangers, and Lithgow struck a large blow from another Livingston player.
The diagonal passes continued to come in the Livingston cart, but without success, and the two penalty demands - after Halkett had roughed up Glenn Middleton and after a pent - were not accepted.
"Fenomenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their game style and team have hardly changed since returning to the top, but the merits must be given to Holt for the way he trained his team since he took over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren't very inspired.
Although they have had good performance since Gerrard led them, they have not reached the same standards.
The empty passes were unsuccessful, they only managed once to catch the goal of the free opponents, and this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed reactions on Erdogan's visit to Cologne
Everything was pink on Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at remedying relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied with issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU bid.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world outside Turkey.
Police have invoked security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but quite a few supporters have gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan, most Kurds, voiced, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him with open arms in the country.
The opposition protests reflect the division of a visitor considered a hero by some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies of car collision
A cyclist died after a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the scene, but the man died on the scene.
The accident occurs only a few months after another cyclist died of an accident on Childers Street, where the driver fled the scene, which is about a mile from where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the bus route is diverted and motorcyclists were recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in a skirmish
Six prison officers were injured following a skirmish at a men's high security prison, a representative of the prison said.
On Sunday, a skirmish broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at about 9:30, which was underway.
Specialized officers were brought in to deal with the skirmish, involving eight inmates, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: “The assistance of the prison staff was requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical attention after being injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, officers in charge of disturbances were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, with staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded by hurricane Rosa (dry areas can benefit from this)
Rarely does a tropical depression occur in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwest desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of rapid flooding for Monday and Tuesday in the western part of Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of Monday it will cause precipitation.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix announced in a Twitter message that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression for a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action over a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Center for Hurricanes predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other parts of the southwest desert, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities ranging from 3 to 5 cm will be recorded, with total possible quantities of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, in some areas torrential rain will be beneficial, as south-west faces drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona faces at least a severe drought, namely the second largest category", information found on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides in the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power on Sunday morning, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 19 km per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and therefore diminish.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high risk of flooding.
"Torrential rains between 8 and 10 cm are expected" from Baja California to Northwestern Sonora, and can reach 25 cm," according to Weather.com.
Rosa will then head north into Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States," a representative of the National Center for Hurricanes said.
These rains are expected to cause sudden floods, which will endanger people's lives, and bring waste streams to deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old male were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he's in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers sought help from citizens who may have material on their mobile phone, respectively, to report to the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced "discontent and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh faced "discontent and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he sexually harassed her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in court on her statement.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage that day.
"A vote confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best minds in the legal field of this generation," he told crowds of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican presence in the intermediate elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm kind of running," he said.
"For this reason, I am all over the positive opinion of the candidates I consider to be great."
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote at the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a GOP assistant for CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves six metres high hit the beach at dusk, people being taken by the waters and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still minding their beach activities and did not run immediately, thus becoming victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, BNPB's spokesman for disaster mitigation at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami brought with it cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami travelled at a speed of 800km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency show several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges overturned and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the lines continued to rock the coastal city.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of Hiroshima's atomic bomb in World War II.
Perhaps the geographical structure of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, has intensified the size of the tsunami, he added.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he also said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the victims and the damage could be larger along the coast of 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely disrupted without any information" in Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
On Saturday, the agency was sharply criticised for failing to inform that a tsunami would strike Palu, although authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In social networking posts, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching the people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the veracity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a major power disruption, which has blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the authorities' rescue efforts.
The army has started sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evicted people still need food and other basics.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to Palu's evacuation centres for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the town of Palu, where employees are staying in improvised shelters in the office yard, they passed devastating scenes, said Dibica.
He added: "They told me they had seen many houses destroyed."
The situation is very serious.
Even though aid groups started to start disaster relief, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise had been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesia's regulations, financial resources, supplies of materials and personnel can only reach a disaster site if declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a province-level disaster," said Aulya Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, "Yes, this is a national disaster," we can begin international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet."
After the second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, friends and families of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously rescued from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue personnel released a woman who had been under the ruins for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the National Paragliding Team, coached for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paraglider pilots.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"In view of my experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, hours after the news of Roa Roa's collapse in the paragliding sports community, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to Palu's competitors who attended the beach festival.
But there was only one gray tick, and not two blue ticks, in front of his messages.
"I think that means that the messages were not sent," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 during a Newport on the Levee ATM
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was supplying an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in his statement.
While he was busy, another man "run behind Brink's back" and stole a bag of money to carry.
According to the communiqué, witnesses noted several suspects who fled the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information on their identity is asked to contact the Newport police at telephone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his stage name to "Ye"
The rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye".
He made the Twitter change announcement Saturday: "The individual officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he expects to release his new album, Yandhi.
He comes to the show instead of the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled "for emotional reasons", said the producer of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West previously stated that this word also has a religious significance for him.
"I think "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West also said earlier this year, during the discussion about the title of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm new, it's about us.
It all started from "Kanye", which means the only one, and it came to "Ye", which is a reflection on our good, bad, unclear things and on the whole.
The album is more of a reflection on what we are as people."
He is one of several rappers who have chosen to change his stage name.
Sean Combs had numerous stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
And a former West collaborator, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with hyphen, sometimes without, as well as with big letters.
Mexican president promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military forces against civilians, as the country approached the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlateolco Plaza that he would "never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
The troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the market on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when students' left-wing movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and by opening several free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people to criminal gangs.
The US should double the funding for IA
While China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several members of the US government have made announcements on AI, even though an official strategy for artificial intelligence is missing in the US.
China, meanwhile, presented its plan last year: it aims to come first in terms of IA innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the IA research budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are much further back than the US and that we are looking for the next AI breakthrough," Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances for the next big IA achievement to be made in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpowers AI: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that defeated the American player Othello, which was the best in the field at the time, and later served as executive director at Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated previous competitions by American governments in the field of technology, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's driving academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the US step up its efforts to AI.
"I think we should automatically offer a visa to PhDs in AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Development Plan for the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the United States Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, with the aim of involving partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the US Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called "AI Next".
Also, at this point, the NSF invests more than $100 million a year in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, there were no changes in the United States legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians to vote in referendum if they want to change country name
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wanted the country's name to be changed to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a change that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, claims the neighbouring country's name is a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and that a boycott campaign has placed doubt on turnout, possibly not reaching the minimum of 50% required for the validation of the referendum.
The question on the ballot in the referendum will be: "Do you agree with EU and NATO membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted into entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum is needed in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported until 1:00.
However, the participation was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the persons with the right to vote came to the vote.
"I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje, the country's capital.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on changing Macedonia's name, which will allow him to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and pulled up chairs in front of tents raised by those boycotting the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the majority will be in favour of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after voting.
He said a result in favour of changing the name would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Research Institute for Policy, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, under the number of participants needed.
According to another poll by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70% said they would vote in favour of change.
For the referendum to be valid, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since the government took over last May.
Video: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero manages to pass the entire Brighton defense and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to break through Brighton's defenses and win Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among three defensive players from Brighton, before reaching the free field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to pass a defender, and then surpassed several opponents at the edge of Brighton's chariot.
After that, he threw a pass to the left, and the balloon reached Sterling.
The English striker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who struck the ball with his right foot, and managed to avoid Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero faces several leg problems," Pep Guardiola, the Manchester City team manager, told reporters.
“I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling is the one who gained their initial advantage for the Azuri in the Premier League game.
The goal came in minute 29.
Aguero gained a deep pass in Brighton's territory at that stage.
Then he gave Leroy Sane a pass on the left flank.
Sane dribbled the balloon several times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it in the direction of the gate.
The Azuri's attacker hit the balloon to the net just before he headed out of the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim at 12:55 on Tuesday in the group stage at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make a killing in the game against Rockies.
With the national team eliminated from the competition in play-offs, there were not many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win the game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still implications in the play-offs for the Rockies, which have an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies achieved at least one unpredictable spot, with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday evening, but still trying to retain their first divisional title.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level at any point where I could face it this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open Sunday's match, but is reportedly inclined to let Scherzer take his first hit in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening shot of match number 34, had a warm-up session Thursday and will throw under normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 misses in 220 and 2/3 matches this season.
Trump Expresses Support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding the decision of the Supreme Court regarding Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of republican presence in the mid-term elections.
“All our effort is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big ones, I'm not running, but I'm actually running, that's why I'm trying really hard to support the good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “See this dreadful, radical group of Democrats, see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by using any necessary means, you can see the wickedness of them.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that's what they want, to have power and control, and we won't give it away."
He also said the Democrats were on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
"And you can see this in the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "furious and evil, naughty and liars".
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party, who is part of the Senate Judicial Committee, which was strongly booed by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
What?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute -- that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different view.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
It did not surprise me at all that Momentum activists in my local party supported the motion of no confidence as far as I am concerned.
After all, I am just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehement in anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the no-confidence motion was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbin said.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, which Jeremy also did not share with previous leaders.
The Labour Party's Nottingham East Friday meeting said "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For the most part of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evening were so.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings are not conducted in this way, and the promise of a "better, gentler" political environment has long been forgotten, if ever respected.
It has become increasingly apparent that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things have started to be like this since Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision of politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree on things that I would not have previously agreed to, including national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there's a wave of abuses on the desocialization networks calling for my removal from the party, denouncing centre politics, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than my colleagues, because comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are experiencing sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this respect.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with every motion to censor or change the selection rules, the party is becoming less flexible on this issue.
Many people have recommended in the last two years that I put my head down, not be so vocal, and everything "will be fine" that way.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence that the government has shown has led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them most, as a local adviser or minister.
I never hid my political opinions, including in the last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and matters that I do not agree with in relation to the current leadership are unclear.
To those who supported Friday's motion, I can only tell them that, in the context that the country is going to Brexit, which will affect our households, businesses and local services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I wish to convey is not for the Momentum Group in Nottingham, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of elimination from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions that I consider to be in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the Ayr football team tops the charts
Despite the fact that two late attempts have somehow influenced the final outcome, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's extremely interactive match in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now on top of the rankings, being the only team without any defeat of the ten.
In the end, it was all about their better defenses, as well as the fact that they took more advantage of their chances, which helped the host team and satisfied Coach Peter Murchie.
"We have undergone several tests during our matches to this point and we continue to be unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie de la Melrose said: "Merite goes to Ayr, they took more chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who could join the team, playing at the Warriors, allowed Melrose to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unturned attempt.
Climo scored a penalty for Ayr and, right in the middle of the game, managed to score, and then managed to turn an individual attempt, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for several minutes due to the severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was taken out of the field with the stretcher, and from the start of the game, Ayr unleashed through the attempt of the player Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climate.
Ayr team captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again, Melrose made the reserve player pay with an unturned attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of severe pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for liking Climate without the ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climate transformed the attempt, as it did again near the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" move and sent extreme Gregor Henry deep for the fifth attempt of the host team.
The star of the "Still Game" sitcom seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the "Still Game" sitcom, seems ready to move to the hospitality industry after learning that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis on his beloved BBC show, writing his script and playing alongside his long-time partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, number nine, would be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to information in the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wants to get involved in the "restaurant development industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings fly the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is rightfully ours.
We have to get her back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a bloody conflict of 19th century resources is still alive – just like the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in decades, as Bolivia expects an International Court of Justice ruling on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ's decision on big screens across the country, hoping The Hague tribunal will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that after decades of strong talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign outing of Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial fight for reelection next year – also has much to gain from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that too little would change if it did.
The United Nations body within the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the territory belonging to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after closing arguments have been heard, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Chilean expert in international law.
And not only has Bolivia not been successful, but the last four years may have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric weakened any remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements with each other," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – another of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – was using the maritime problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to move past it."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons unless it could trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep its promises during a summit in Singapore with rival leaders.
Its comments come in a context where US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting diplomatic action on the nuclear threat more than three months after meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was an "unreal dream" that continued sanctions and the U.S. objection to the declaration of the end of the Korean war would ever cause the territory of the north to give way.
Washington has a reluctance to agree to the statement without the Pyongyang taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are a lot of skeptics who don't think that Pyongyang has serious intentions of giving up the arsenal that the country considers to be the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will be available in shops soon
If you are looking for some hats to expand your collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you no longer have to look.
Fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked the participants at Fashion Week in Paris, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer collection in 2019.
Hardly practical hats took the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion designers sent creations that steal eyes on the podium.
Valentino's piece of creation was an extravagant, beige hat, with a broad boron, like a feather, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories included melons adorned with beads, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to protect your head against the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and did not fashion haute couture.
One of the creations seemed to be diving equipment, with an oxygen tube and glasses, while another appeared to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a fashion style, with oversized clothing, you're in luck.
Stylists predict a return of enormous bonnets to luxury fashion shops.
The oversized hats return after the appearance of the hat "La Bomba", the straw hat with a broad boron, seen to everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the hat at all practical that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely the straw bag for the beach, with a size as large as the model in the bathing suit that wears it.
The orange rafie bag, with rafie fringes and a white leather handle, was the piece of resistance of Jacquemus's spring-summer collection "La Riviera" at Fashion Week in Paris
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury shops next summer, because the fashion designer had such a strong impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record on academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for high and higher education, career chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Mandarin Higher Grade A certificate; also 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French and 63% of those who study Spanish received such a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, languages, as matter, are held in the same way as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other areas.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for the reasons employers have given to the fight for job vacancies, 17% have been attributed to a language skills shortage.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative for preparing young people for their future career.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a skill throughout their life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing countries, children will be more likely to find significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn the languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when looking ahead by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be more languages of choice in independent schools, with teachers who specialize in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills needed to succeed, however the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
I made them fair (must be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would be opening Sunday's pre-season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes will play remains to settle.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season program.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare," he said.
Time of Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins this evening a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five rallyes scheduled the following week, which include stops in places where the electorate is favorable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his candidate for the Supreme Court seat is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's election rally take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I track him online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 East Coast time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's electoral rally online in West Virginia through the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss this week's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, who has become tensed by allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, so the FBI can investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain a little ground.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said the role of these five rallyes next week is "energising volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so important for his programme that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very busy campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be appointed, told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won the election at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is headed into the polls.
"The fact that the president came to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for simple challenges that begin on Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it is possible that Saturday afternoon's foursome was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The constantly oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the sports world, but the players really believe in it, especially in the case of competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
"They were leading us by six points, now the difference is only four points, so we rely on this drop for a little motivation," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are still twelve points at stake.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons to encourage them, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each won three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green zone with lethal precision, setting an example for his colleagues.
Those festive gourds became louder as the round progressed, especially when it scored a crucial point by which it tied the score in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had been led two points after the first two holes.
The hit that won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar howling, a howling that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to focus and just worry about your own game," Spieth says.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but adorable couple won four out of four matches and they can't seem to fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who did not need any extra hits Saturday afternoon, but this statement is also valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the nine Friday morning points.
This performance and the way in which their energy seems to flow towards and from the enthusiastic audience strengthens the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they could achieve a potential victory for Europeans when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different holes.
Discussions about the glory of Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the fourballs, when he paired with Alex Noren.
One extra blow and two doubles to the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, though, no one will be safe.
Fourballs and Foursome samples are fascinating and are worth watching at close range due to the interactions between pairs, given and undated advice and how a strategy can change on the spot.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the US team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, especially in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on Ryder Cup's final day
Europe begins the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after completing the fourballs and foursome games on Saturday with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two victories in front of a reluctant Tiger Woods, which increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to win back the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes in the morning's fourballs and won the 3-1 series.
The US opposed a more serious resistance to the Foursome challenge, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points out of 12 simple Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and along with Molinari, a pair known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points of the four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they made a superb stand to defeat the discouraged Woods and American Novices Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in his two matches on Saturday, had occasional flashes of genius, but so far lost 19 out of 29 games at fourballs and foursome, seven of which were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during his morning fourballs session, returned with his partner Henrik Stenson to the Foursome and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1 in the world.
Europe did not, however, have an obstacleless journey on this pleasant and cool day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the standard for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2-1 match against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then returned later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the Foursome event after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in simple challenges, though, because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being second in a row for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is no "no chance" to disarm unilaterally as long as there is no trust
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said Saturday to the United Nations that extending sanctions would deepen mistrust in the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the Global Council's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had implemented "significant measures to prove its good faith" last year, such as stopping nuclear testing and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the US," he said.
"If we cannot trust the US, we will not trust our national security capabilities and, under such circumstances, we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri resumed the familiar objections of North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "scheduled" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject unilateral denuclearisation, as the Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit for the first time between a US President-in-Office and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to making progress towards a "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered guarantees on the security of North Korea.
North Korea sought an official end to the Korean War in 1950–53, but the United States stated that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has failed to comply with requests to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the "first denuclearisation" option and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, and even objects to the "declaration of end of war," Ri said.
"The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion that only people who do not know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader referred to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, President of South Korea for the past five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearisation had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even under these circumstances, Ri's tone of speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target US territory with North Korean missiles after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened North Korea with "total destruction" last year, praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but noted that work was just beginning and that sanctions would remain valid until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned period for this and added: "It doesn't matter if it takes two or three years or five months."
China and Russia say that Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The application of sanctions to the Security Council must continue vigorously and without interruption until we obtain complete, final and confirmed denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the halls of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not work very well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but after just a few hours, North Korea denounced the fact that he made "gangster threats".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch pad and a nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted a normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students teach how to rest long enough
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing "macho" culture that makes them submit to "all night" learning sessions, energized with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that students of the most prestigious university in the world often do not master even the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is thought to be the first of its kind in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning ability.
“In the end, a girl came and said to me, “Why am I being told this only now, in the last year?”
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as the general wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course may involve a number of interactive tasks.
Within a section is presented the image of a dorm room, and students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, gym pants and books to tell them what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
"We know that we cannot change the behaviour of students instantly.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as everyone has a right to know what the health effects of smoking are," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud to have learned all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his first years at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before enrolling in this institution where the competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler has advised students to set up an alarm to know when it is time to go to bed, as well as for waking up time, and to know what are the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal takes down Gerrard's team
Rangers suffer from another case of depression on the move because Dolly Menga's strike condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team on Ibrox wanted to win their first away victory from the 4-1 victory against St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as a coach, which puts the Rangers eight points behind Hearts, the authoritarian leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the uninspiring Rangers never seemed able to match.
The Rangers thus fell to sixth place in the rankings, while Livingston climbed to third place, behind the Hibernian, to a single goal difference.
And the Rangers might also face other problems, because Aunt Referee Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the visiting team fans' lawn.
Gerrard exchanged eight players from the team that won easy against Ayr in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players at Livingstone who managed to achieve a match with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained team choked its opponents during the match.
Even though the Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more efficiently.
He should have scored just two minutes after the game began, when Menga's first pass propelled Scott Pittman to the gate defended by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her past the bar.
The Rangers have taken over, but have given the impression that they hope more than they trust their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed that he should have received a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
The Rangers only managed two strikes on the gate in the first half, but the former goalkeeper on Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was not at all disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak blow.
Although Livingstone's 34th minute goal did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny it was worth it, even for the effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep run of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga, who finished with a simple shot.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he switched Ryan Kent to Coulibaly; this movement almost paid off immediately, when the extreme centered Morelos, but impressive Kelly stepped out of the buds to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to the exact same type of match he preferred, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting the run after the run.
Holt's team could have expanded their advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' strike, then Lithgow head-butted the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a Rangers reserve, called for a penalty towards the end of the match, when he struck Jacobs, but again Thomson disagreed.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and counting CONTINUES...), is the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science since then, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as happened in the film "The Bells of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played cowboys with improbable inclinations to science:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yeah, there's a lot of pops!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can “detect” a protein common to many cancers and then be re-injected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can “detect” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and to “teach” them to target cancer cells, also worked to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a support diatribe of Trump while wearing a MAGA cap after appearing at SNL.
It didn't turn out too well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a wild performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he intended to run for the 2020 elections.
After performing his third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, the artist unleashed himself in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked: “How can you like Trump? It’s racist”
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began with a play starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on charges of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, West's diatribe footage was uploaded to the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had trouble backstage because of his cap.
“They tried to intimidate me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out wearing this hat."
I've been assaulted!
They also told me that we have reached very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see how low I've come?", and then he said, "I'm going to catch Superman's cloak, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try with love."
His comments drew booing from the audience at least twice, and members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; one person on this team told the publication: "A complete silence was placed in the studio."
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song I Love it dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest spirits among us: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING THE GLOAT."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West simply "was himself and that's wonderful".
"But I choose not to reward anyone (buying his music or clothing or supporting his “art”) who I think embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that he is now "the being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in Diddy's footsteps, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Charge of attempted murder for stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant on the east side of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defence lawyer is expected before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series The Game of Thrones, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing these roles on the screen makes boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that "something had happened wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague from the Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he was "very determined" to talk about the problem.
"Personally, I am very determined to talk about it now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we taught men about being adults, given the problem we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What do young boys learn from TV and the street, what makes them think there has to be a certain type of man?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it is clear that something has happened to young people."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not play in any series based on the Game of Thrones after the series ended in the summer of next year, saying "he finished with the battlefields and the horses".
Since November, Kit will be in a new production of True West by Sam Shepard, which presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him due to the series The Game of Thrones is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I did this show, so it ensured my family's future and my life from now on," said Kit.
Rose starred as Ygritte, lover of Jon Snow, the character played by Kit in the fantasy series winning several Emmys.
The couple married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly to some areas of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual HIV transmission is an acute problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission of diseases come from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked the data to Republican Party senators, talks about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters denounced Saturday allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges were made by analysts and websites by "extremely right".
"Lies, lies and other miserable lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
Information leaked included the addresses and personal phone numbers of senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated as a Supreme Court judge.
The leak took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and presented the information to a member of Waters' team, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
‘The team member, whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is furious," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that he does not have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something they haven't done, they don't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
You don't have to question the accuser's motivation.
You need to be calm and quiet."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's, criticised by the Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in mid-term elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"Important, if true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office had alerted "appropriate authorities and legal entities to these false accusations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that they will answer to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members."
Johnny English Review strikes again: a play on spy movies with Rowan Atkinson in the lead role
It became a tradition to look for Brexit-related meanings in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the action film parodies series that has Johnny English as the main character, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returns.
Will this taunting satire of how strange we are become the nation's new export opportunity?
However, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with his eyes staring and his rubber face, has been renewed for the second time his license to ruin everything. The character's name means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the film audience in non-English speaking countries.
He is, of course, the twisted secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that guy who contributed a single note to the musical theme of the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
The character relies on the explorer and mysterious countryless man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV commercials, which left chaos behind him.
This last JE adventure also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the rotor blades gently hit his helmet.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is quite weak and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" films, such as those in the 007 series or Mission Impossible, confidently offer comic moments as an ingredient.
Humor seems to address children more than adults, and for me, Johnny English's wacky adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's silent film gags when he plays as Bean.
As always, the premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain's supersecret spy network and revealed the identities of British undercover agents, to the desperation of the service agent, a regrettablely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a pompous and under siege prime minister, who is already suffering a serious crisis due to a fall in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with her character like Theresa May, but the script does not offer her the chance to shine.
His secret intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so they must activate a retired agent.
This is Johnny English himself, now working as a teacher in a school for the upper class, but he also teaches how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute gags, because English runs a school of school of rock-style spies.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency session, then reunited with his old partner, Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little wasted.
Therefore, these Batman and Robin of creating entanglements in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, confronting the beautiful fatal female Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire of the technology industry who claims to be able to solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start in a odyssey of burlesque adventures: disguised as waiters, set on fire a fashionable French restaurant, create chaos when they sneak aboard Volta's luxury boat, then English triggers anarchy in pure form when they try to use a set of virtual reality glasses to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but no matter how cute and colorful the film is, it looks like a television production for children.
A pretty mediocre movie.
As with the other Johnny English movies, I can't stop asking myself: can the British film industry really not give Rowan Atkinson a role to match his talent?
Labour deny they plan to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan that the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
The party seems to want company leaders to take advantage of possible savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) giving employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have changed.
Sources say the idea would "fit" to the party's economic programme, which wants to tip the balance in favour of the workers.
The transition to the four-day work week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A source of the Labour Party leadership told The Sunday Times: "The announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but a week of four-day work is an appropriate aspiration in the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the party's overall strategy on industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day work week was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party."
Lord Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from "faceless directors" and "profiters" from utility companies.
The plans of the Lord Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of water-supplying kings may not recover their actions in full, as the Labour Government may perceive "deductions" due to some found crimes.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers to company boards and create property funds to cede 10% of private sector companies' equity to employees, thus receiving annual dividends of up to about £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh would change their minds
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his candidacy as a Supreme Court judge for at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators might be convinced to stop supporting him due to FBI findings.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, “Are you guilty?”
The answer was decided, promptly, unequivocally."
Graham's vote, though, seems to be digging in stone.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so it would take some explosive accusations," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejects the charges," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“ None of her names confirmed the account.
And it was 36 years ago.
I doubt anything's gonna change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event attended by an impressive group of stars, with an equally impressive mission: eliminating world poverty.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park lawn, not only to track artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to pay for a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help raise awareness of the goal of eliminating global poverty.
But what success did the Global Citizen Festival have when it was just 12 years away to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism", a concept that refers to people who feel like they have achieved something by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011 there have been more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, which have promoted different objectives.
The organisation says these actions have driven world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its shares, on whose account at least 10 billion dollars have already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries who have committed to "help children grow to their full potential", which promised to offer Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the help of the government of Great Britain, donors, national governments and global citizens like yourself, we can make social injustice of malnutrition become just a footnote in the book of history," Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, said in front of the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance the project The Power of Nutrition, which would provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights or anti-aparheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weenand, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use naval forces to "block" Russia's energy exports, says Home Secretary
Washington may, "if necessary", turn to naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke quoted Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke claims that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason I'm in the Middle East is that they want to broker the sale of energy, as they do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and ways to manage the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade, so that energy does not go out into the market," he said.
Zinke addressed participants in an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that declares itself "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
It continued by comparing the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is basically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying Russia "knows only one trick" because of the economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase the exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this respect, Trump’s representatives, including President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a ‘prisoner’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said the US' fierce opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we look at it the same way: energy cannot be a means of putting pressure on it and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Aleksandr Novak, Russian Energy Minister, said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third state interfering with our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of Industries of Germany (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks seriously" to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday that she had to "think seriously" whether to run for President after the mid-term election.
During his meeting at City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
"It is time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, and that requires a strong woman," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for President."
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying that he "directed the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a Twitter message on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that even most of Warren's voters do not believe they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% are against it.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said it would be officially decided by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the PTSD that Track Palin suffers from at a Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a case of domestic violence
"The things my own son goes through, through which he went back... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the wounds our soldiers return with," told the public gathered at a rally to support Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "return a little different, rougher, come back wondering if there is any respect for what they and their soldiers in the armed and air forces, as well as all the other members of the Army, have done for the country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing reports of domestic violence and possession of a drunken firearm, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Colombia challenge a new asylum application policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia argue a legal challenge to the new US policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who try to escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a amicus curiae request in Washington on Friday to support a challenge to asylum policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions trial that American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a gang", abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-appointed lawyer representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produced a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing a widespread problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Council that allowed immigrants without papers trying to escape domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "ignorating decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"The federal law says that all asylum applications must be tried on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such a limitation violates this principle," it says in the amicus curiae application.
In addition, lawyers argue in the request that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants affects the US economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce”.
Jeff Sessions, US Attorney General, ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims who are trying to escape gang abuse and violence.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a social group or because of political opinion," Sessions said on 11 June, when he announced politics.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems that people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a race against time to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforts her baby with a fever at an evacuation centre in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Embulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient."
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded goods, trying to save all that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale, were overcome by the situation.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous replicas.
He has tears in his eyes when he remembers how the violent earthquake felt by shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife when she cried for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "abuse" of "propagating ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily that praised the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using US media to distribute propaganda material.
US President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the China-paid supplement in Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 elections for Congress, an accusation China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials have told Reuters that it is a new phase in a campaign in Washington's escalation to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war, involving waves of increases in import tariffs.
The tariffs imposed by China in retaliation at the beginning of the trade war were created to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, experts from China and the US said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing injured American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues this abuse by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"When spreading propaganda by publishing an advertisement in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect such a cherished tradition of freedom of expression and a free press in America," Branstad writes.
"In return, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent views that Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic path, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans alienate female voters before mid-term elections because of the Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, from several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warned that there would be a contradiction, especially from women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and most Republicans who discussed it publicly intend to continue voting.
"Such reactions will not be forgotten," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute initiative (the Arizona representative) on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group said Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors chanted "Come November!" while demonstrating in the halls of the Senate when Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
"People say they were already very big, and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that he might follow a countermeasure if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
"This has turned into a mix-up for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in the committee or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, but also about how the Republicans dealt with this situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of the USA Priorities, an electoral support group of Democrats, for the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided as to what part they should believe according to Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new survey conducted by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents strongly believe or believe that Ford's testimony is likely to have been true, while 35% said they believed it strongly or that Kavanaugh's testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford sworn before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh abused her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party while attending Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "global domination".
"Now we have to do it," he talked about starting up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online data archives" or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, musical libraries or other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this personal online data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal data consolidation".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute adequate resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely screwed up all of a sudden.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post published on Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "The Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in World War I is celebrated
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victorian Cross medal as a combatant in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had received Britain's highest military honor.
A commemorative stone was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "wonderfully symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy artillery and machine guns fire.
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked an artillery nest himself and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "one thing I know I will never be able to equal, but that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him.
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig cartoons instead.
Imagine you stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you couldn't watch the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, British viewers were amazed when the broadcast was replaced by an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all because they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
A fan tweeted the move to the children's cartoon as "a kind of a bad joke".
"Governmental regulations say that this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future they would schedule their events so that they could also be watched by British viewers.
"When I think about reruns, I think we could probably work it out," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, we thought it was a technical mix-up.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We'll stick to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give fans more and we crossed the line.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he got to school that "not everyone is like me".
Invited to the first show Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he talks about gay people's rights to give others "hope".
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the tradition show, will be absent for several months due to illness.
Invited in the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls."
He said, "So far, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, were the real things that gave me strength and stamina to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games became a renowned supporter of the LGBT campaigns and took advantage of the release at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge several countries to decriminise homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live freely, without consequences, and because he wanted to give others "hope".
The world's triple champion said that "he was taken by surprise" by falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" -- he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years -- he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through the same good and bad moments.
In June, they became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, according to Daley, changed his whole perspective.
"If I had been asked last year, I would have been only interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears his father's name, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if they had received tickets for the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to be in the first place.
"I couldn't say 'you won't be able to be a father in the first place'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and died that I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that's what I'd dreamed of my whole life, jumping in front of people in my country at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired him in his chosen music, Proud by Heather Small, which encouraged him before the Olympic Games and still thrills him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was put on the bench on Saturday in the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in the forty-seventh Ryder Cup match, but he will have to recover in good shape so that this is not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the 12th time, another record, was placed on Captain Jim Furyk's bench for the fourballs and foursome on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the United States team, the quintuple major tournament winner divided his day between being a cheerleading teammate and practicing his kicks, hoping that he would right what he did wrong.
The 48-year-old player has never had the straightest drives, not even at the best time of his career, so he is not the best choice for the narrow terrain at Le Golf National, where long areas of rough often punish unfair blows.
And if the field is not a big enough challenge, in Sunday's ninth game Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who has allied himself with Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points at the entry into the 12 simple matches, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk declared himself confident in his player's ability, but could not have said otherwise anyway.
"He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the shoulder, hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed a great deal to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably never imagined he'd be in two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened, and that's how I thought we had to do it.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most of the games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never stood up to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 matches won, 20 lost and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he likes to joke with players, he's a great guy in the team locker room," he explained.
“I think young players have fun joking with him, it was fun to see them do it during the week.
His role is more important, it's not just about the game."
Europe team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the considerable advance may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of simple challenges in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 Valderrama match, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but barely managed to defeat them with a minimum difference of 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
“I remember that we had a considerable advance on Valderrama; we also had a big advance at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win”, said Bjorn (in the picture) after watching the team in 2018, which won 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now leads 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"So history shows me and my team that it is not yet ready.
Tomorrow we have to play at full speed.
Let's go out in the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are on the board.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We have always said, we must focus on the 12 players on our team, but we also know what awaits us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted by the way his players handled a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I am in no hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow's a whole different situation.
Individual performance is important tomorrow, and this is different.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when things are going well, but when you're on your own, then you're being tested to the fullest, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to send to the players, that you have to be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and they have to play as best they can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opposing team, hopes that his players will play better in the simple challenge than they did with their partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such returns on the last day: he was on the Brookline winning team, then on the loser team when Europe succeeded in "the miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word," he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
“We have 12 big games tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When inertia develops in a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those matches in the middle.
We've created the right batch and ordered the players as we would like, you know, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the battle: he would face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
"I chose this group of players in this order, because I think it covers all the topics," Bjorn said about the simple sample batch.
Germany's new warship, delayed again
The latest frigate of German naval forces should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warships, but this will not happen until next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The entry into service of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the standard ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, was now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to be introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but post-delivery problems affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is assumed that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technologies, which provide a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for the new frigates to go on missions lasting two years without returning to the original port.
However, continuing delays mean that these state-of-the-art warships, which are said to increase Germany's maritime strength, will already be obsolete before entering the service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available about the reasons for refusal, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware failures" that would have made the warship useless on a combat mission.
Software failures were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it has been shown that the vessel was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future facilities.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as the German ships used in World War II.
In addition to faulty mechanisms, and the price of the entire project, including crew training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an amazing 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance given the latest warnings that Germany's maritime power is falling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence commission in Germany's parliament, acknowledged that the Navy "has begun to run out of ships that can be sent on missions".
The official said the problem has grown steadily over time, as old vessels have been decommissioned without being replaced by new ones.
He deplored that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates had entered into operation within the Navy.
National Trust spies on bats' secret lives
New research that is being conducted on a Scottish Highland property wants to reveal how bats use their environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will analyse common dwarf bats and Pygmies bats, as well as eared bats and water bats from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in key places around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
The specialized audio analysis of all records will estimate the frequency of bat sounds and what species emit certain sounds.
A map of the habitat and a report will also be produced to create a detailed, scale picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as lawn creation, and which is the best way to maintain forest meadows for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across Britain have declined considerably in the last century.
They are at risk from construction and development work affecting their nests, but also from habitat loss.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also risks, as are fly traps and some chemical treatments for construction materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is seriously thinking about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, control nests and sometimes carry out rescue missions.
The organization even created the first and only reserve of bats in Scotland, on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of bats are found in Scotland.
The owner of the estate, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here, at Thorave, the area is wonderful for bats," he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to multiply."
It underlines the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance work on properties, because the mere unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and puppies, which could destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are forbidden actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don't know how populations evolve for many of our species."
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges against him were "fake news" and that some people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
Portugal's attacker and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the football player paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in an Instagram Live video for his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the winner of the Golden Balloon in front of the video camera.
"They want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous by using my name, but I'm used to it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these charges, which they called "an inadmissible report of private-life suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for " moral damage equivalent to an adequate amount for the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the worst violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anally, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that, after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees in front of her and told her that he was a "good boy" of "99 %", and that he was betrayed by that "one percent".
The document claims Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims to have addressed the police and that the photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later accepted an agreement outside the courtroom because she was "terrified by the possibility of revenge" and was worried that she would "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that agreement because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused of, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain "would regret forever" loss of car manufacturers
Britain "would regret forever" if it lost its status as world leader in car production after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain exits the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays at the border in a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Aventis brands of Toyota are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they fear leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the Oxford factory where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are caused by what producers call supply chain risks in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on the "fixed on time" principle: for custom-made machines, parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and in the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more inventory for one day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so the production would be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these delays at the border".
"There must be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers shows that we must be able to continue to use what was a very successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not specify how long production will have to be stopped, but warned that increased prices could reduce the long-term competitive capacity of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the United Union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: "The experience has taught me that after they disappear, these jobs do not return."
A government spokesman said: "We have created a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed another week", as he fights for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in elections, links between Trump's aids and Russia, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
Rumors of Trump firing the deputy state's attorney, thus jeopardising Mueller's independence, have been circulating in circles in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Legal Commission hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which again postponed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “A date has not been set yet. It can be this week or it can be postponed for a week, taking into account all the other things that are now happening at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reduction in briefings was not caused by the dislike of TV reporters, who like to show off, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to show off."
Then he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be enhanced.
"The president is attending more questions and answers than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "I have analyzed the figures."
"There will still be briefings," Sanders said, but "it seems much better for the press to have the opportunity to address the questions directly to the President of the United States, not to me.
We try to do this most of the time and you can see that we have done this many times in the last few weeks, and discussions with the President of the United States will replace press briefings when it is available."
Trump usually answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, with an impromptu appearance, somewhere bizarre, in front of reporters gathered.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health is addressed in a letter to EU employees at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland about concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and the desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter as it was less than six months before the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to bearing the costs of requesting permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, expecting decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government has started to prepare more and more for a different scenario, where there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union, but also outside the European Union, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday in a match his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores, 31-27, said Mike Organ de la Tennessee.
Tennessee State's lead coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the hit took place shortly before the break.
"It reached the edge line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Abercrombie was placed with the oxygen mask by the physical trainers and medical staff on the edge line before placing him on a stretcher and transporting him off the ground for a thorough evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operation he was undergoing at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details of the type/scale of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five plywoods in total before leaving the match, reaching 18 plywoods throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom, and the additional money will be used to help homeless people, according to the new Conservative Party plans
This change will neutralise Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with voting rights
Judicial stamp duty to be applied to non-taxpayers in the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of judicial stamp duty when buying a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa May is expected to announce today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with voting rights, promising better-priced homes and targeting high-income earners.
The higher stamp fee will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not taxable in the United Kingdom, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help homeless people.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp fee, including the high levels two years ago for the second property and the properties purchased for rental purposes, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to add up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13% of the newly built properties in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which leads to higher prices and puts those who want to buy their first home in difficulty.
Several prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping property prices high as a result of purchasing land without using it, and asked Theresa May to waive taxes on affordable houses in order to address the UK's "house problem".
Corbyn announced a series of proposals for attractive real estate reforms, including rent controls and an end to unmotivated discharges.
It also wants to give councils greater powers in building new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means remedying the problems that exist in the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies with headquarters abroad, can buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become far too distant, and living in undignified conditions is far too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be the manager of the Scotland national team."
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that his "final goal" is to eventually become the manager of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the challenge of "resurrecting" the northeast club, which currently ranks 3rd in the First League, with a difference of three points from the first place.
He moved to the team at the Light Stadium this summer after winning the return of St. Mirren's football team to the first Scottish Premiership division last season.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We made the national team B and that's about it," Ross told Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“But I spent most of my childhood watching Scotland’s games at Hampden with my father, and I always wanted to come back.
But I'll only get this opportunity if I'm successful as club manager."
Ross' predecessors, as managers of Sunderland, include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic stated that he was not nervous about being the successor of such established names and at such an important club, after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that concerns me that could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team return to the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow him to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get her there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club's return to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years of experience in leadership, after a time when he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of Hearts training staff.
He then helped the Alloa club recover after relegating to C Division and managed to save St. Mirren from demotion, helping the team win the championship title in the next season.
Ross said he felt better now than in his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a decisive moment," he said about taking over the Alloa club.
“I really thought I was more suited for the role of manager than for the role of player.
It may sound strange, because we had a good time, we were earning well, and we had some good moments.
But it's hard being a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them every week.
I'm facing similar situations as a manager in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel it's the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I can do that, I feel it's the thing that suits me best in my entire adult life."

The ideal time to drink a pint of beer is Saturday at 5:30, according to a survey
This summer's heat wave led to an increase in income in UK pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to figures, pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of the business consulting company CGA, who conducted the survey, said: “The constant heat and participation of England in the World Cup over a longer period than expected, contributed to a pattern in July, similar to that of the previous month, when pubs registered up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers lower by 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June decreased further in July.
Pubs and bars that only serve drinks have made a much greater profit than restaurants.
Pubs that serve food have also experienced heat losses, but not as big as restaurants.
Looks like people went out just to drink.
Sales of drinks at all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, a representative of the RSM company that provides services in the hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large sports and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to the sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to lose, although the fall in sales by 4.8% year-on-year will add to current cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not come at a worse time for operators in the food industry and only time will decide whether the moderater temperatures recorded in August will bring better news".
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the low number of newly launched locations.
The company that monitors the sales of UK pubs, bars and restaurants, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined profit of over £9 billion, which is the official industry standard.
One in five kids has a secret account on a social network that they hide from their parents
According to one survey, one in five children, some up to 11 years old, have a secret account on a social network that they hide from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed an increase in "false Insta" accounts
News has increased concerns about sex-related posts
20% of students said they have a "principal" account they show their parents
One in five children, some even up to 11 years old, create an account on a social network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
The news has increased concerns about sexual postings.
20% of the students said they have a "principal" and "clean" account that they show their parents, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, noticed the posting of a teenager who was demanding to be "raped".
According to research conducted by the UK Digital Awareness company and the HMC (Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) in independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them have admitted to holding secret accounts.
HMC's director, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers have no access to."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athlete Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected director without executive power of the Scottish Committee of Athletes at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated field and track athlete, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports activity to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes from Scotland, Britain, as well as around the world, and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with its inclusion in the commission," Beattie said.
Doyle also said: "I am delighted that I will be able to represent athletes and hope to make a real contribution and help the way sports activities are going in Scotland."
The American national athlete, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent commentator at the BBC, remained invalid after having suffered a transient ischemic attack.
She tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will decide whether I'll recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic work, but I fully recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A breast pump ad that compares women to cows divides public opinion online
A breast pump company has caused the division of public opinion in the online environment with an advert comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that is intended to be the "first silent and portable breast pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic commercial, inspired by a music video, to present the freedom the new pump offers to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of cow hay on a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk, but I don't have a tail" and "in case you haven't noticed, these are not udders, but my breasts."
The chorus continues: “I pump, pump, breast-feed the baby, pump, pump, extract milk from the girls.”
However, the advertisement, published on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of whom said it reveals the "horrors" in the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen only a few days after birth," one person wrote.

Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both the mother and the child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "An extremely inappropriate commercial."
Other people defended the ad, a person claiming it was a "hilarious" ad.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
The fire really made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little inappropriate, but I took it for granted.
But the product is brilliant," one person wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny commercial that targets mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilets) and who feel like “cows”.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they danced with discreet pumps placed in bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and it fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra, giving women freedom of movement, the possibility of holding their children in their arms and even going out while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and design developer at Mother commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what the use of a breast pump and the challenges involved in this, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has made the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, two children’s mother appeared on the podium while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were secretly transferred to a refugee camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of people crossing the border each month remained relatively the same, largely because rhetoric and tough policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children at sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves and fear that they will endanger their stay in the country if they request to take over children.
Risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, should record their fingerprints and that their data would be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior customs and immigration official (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), told Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have requested sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80% of people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of processing children into the system, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which children must appear in court one month after detention, and not 60 days after the previous standard, according to the shelter employees.
Many will plead for the case through a video appeal, and not personally to an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more they can become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to the employees of shelters and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are accentuated at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating that a child has problems are not observed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could cause them trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria demands that US, French and Turkish military forces withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria has been at war for eight years.
Mouulem, who is also interim prime minister, said foreign military forces are illegally in Syria, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "the situation will be managed accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said at the assembly.
Mouulem insisted that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been uprooted from their own homes.
He also said Damascus would continue "this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
There are about 2,000 military troops in Syria in the United States, particularly in training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the country shattered by war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Mouulem said there are favourable conditions for their return and accused "a few Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears", which led refugees to keep their distance.
He added: "We sought the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return".
"Political influences are being brought on an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say an agreement recently reached between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarised zone in the Idlib region to drive out the last group of rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russo-Turkish agreement helped avoid a large-scale assault by Syrian forces, supported by Russian forces, on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which are linked to the Al-Qaeda network and which "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy, hopes to meet soon in a first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Mouulem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the Committee's activities should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning of interference.
Why will Trump win his second term
If we were to follow that logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless the deposed procedure or scandals end his presidency earlier, which much of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case it would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time!"
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, prime-time audiences have doubled at CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in prime-time, Fox News is watched by an average of 2.4 million people, compared with 1.7 million years ago, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" has recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people watching it during the evenings of major news.
"This is a topic that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, the producer of ABC's dramatic "Reserve President" series, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and author of "Just the Funny Parties: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why did she ask?
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell said.
In chaos, entertainment is harnessed.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be complete and about the state of the global economy.
Changing jobs is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you arrive at the sixth hour of viewing the debate by a committee of experts on how Bob Woodward uses deep background sources for his book, "Fear", about Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich jacket ("an opulent garment", according to The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Trump's "anatomical parts".
For example, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A lot of what it does gives you the feeling that you watch a reality show and feed you on topics every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment media group and the creator of the show "Aces of Pawn", about the constantly changed distribution and the daily twists caused by Trump (deployment of an argument with the American professional football league, praise to Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, because you're gonna feel like you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his house on the north shore of Kauai, it was 27 degrees outside and it was sunny, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He could not get away from the TV, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate's legal commission and would decide on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing some extraordinary shows in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right."

Overwhelming external financial resources for the closest interim elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of electoral districts, which resulted in two holders of the mandate in an election race for the same office, it is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburgh brought the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb into the race, who won the special elections last spring in another district.
Lamb is running against another incumbent Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents the 12th electoral district of Pennsylvania, which significantly overlaps with the 17th.
The election maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were not constitutional, and the boundaries of the districts were manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the 17th new electoral district has triggered a competition in financing campaigns between important party funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in special, high-profile elections, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade, a Republican had been in office, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalising El Salvador because of its deal with China, but then gave up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners evacuated Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to call on US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama following "recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
But they were considered sanctions only against El Salvador, which received US aid worth about $140 million in 2017, including narcotics control, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high unemployment rate and its crimes.
As internal meetings have made progress, officials in North America and Central America have postponed a high-level conference, focused on security and economic prosperity, to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials at the top of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively completing any review of the sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned for Vice President Mike Pence to address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, wishing to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their accounts were corroborated by an external analyst, who is close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
History Study
The next thing that could happen is Special Councilman Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
It also appears that Mueller is also directing his investigation into the investigation of the existence of a plot between Trump's campaign and Russia in relation to the attack on the US elections.
If Congress changes, Trump will face due responsibility within the body, just as he prepares to appear before voters and possibly a jury of his colleagues.
There are many possible situations, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "fall" is inevitable, which is also true for his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic and that will decide the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to take a coup against Hitler, only if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are experiencing a few such critical moments right now.
What are we gonna do if Trump sacks Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct, or if it is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the middle elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the Austrian match, after Spain's impressive equal against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place her in a strong position to qualify for the G group of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season to equal 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, as Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old player said.
“We started the game thinking that we would get a good result and we won a point.
We could probably have scored at the end, but overall, I think the tie was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we noticed each other better in the second.
On Thursday, it will be a big night for Europe again.
With any luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, with the support of the supporters, we will definitely feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, given my injuries and changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is fine and the boys really like to be here; the training is also going well.
Hopefully, we will persevere, leave behind what happened in the last season and have good results."
Women have insomnia due to retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the study conducted by Nationwide said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about the subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they are not initiating this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide the care you need if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Work with the counselor and the family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these elections could be a significant factor in setting costs.
Involve your Financial Adviser: the Financial Adviser may also be of real aid in relation to the payment of these expenses.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses or you can ensure your own well-being – as far as you have the money.
Get your legal documents in place: come to meet legal issues.
Get a power of attorney on medical decisions, to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and to ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate them.
Also consider making a power of attorney on your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid, if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Don’t forget the little details: imagine that one of your older parents has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and their allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are in charge of it?” Martin asked.
“What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Write a plan on all these things."

The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 02:30, as "random shootings".
The victim failed to see his attacker.
The injuries suffered do not endanger his life, and the police have appealed to witnesses to give statements.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died from a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to authorities, and are expected to increase the number of deaths.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was struck by tsunamis and earthquakes.
Donggala is a regency that extends to a coast of more than 300 km in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, an administrative region located below a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture activities are the central point of the province's economy in the central island of Sulawesi, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
The mining activities to extract nickel are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also, in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Donggala regency, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Circle of Fire, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: on December 26, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, causing the deaths of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the south of the most populous Indonesian island of Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: a 7.6 degree earthquake on the Richter scale took place near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: an earthquake of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: a low-intensity earthquake occurred in Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing damage and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2004, which resulted in a large number of deaths.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: several strong earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, causing the death of over 500 people, mostly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists remained temporarily trapped under debris.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, involved in a domestic violence complaint and resisting arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is in police custody at the Mat-Su unit pending trial, and is detained on the basis of a $500 bail-free pledge, according to KTUU.
He went to court on Saturday, where he declared himself "100% innocent" when asked for a plea, according to the network.
Palin faces three counts of class A crimes, which means he could be incarcerated for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B offense, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of this.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged assault.
The case is pending trial at the Alaskan Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence involving himself in a domestic violence crime complaint and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered from after being part of the military forces in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred outside the central province of Sulawesi, which is located in the northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos showing the moment of impact on social networks.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
U.S. Attorney wants death penalty for suspected New York City terrorist attack
The New York federal prosecutor wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, a rare punishment that had not been imposed in the state for a federal offense since 1953.
Saipov, 30, apparently used a rental truck at Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on its trajectory in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and "intendedly" caused serious bodily injuries, according to the opinion of intent to apply for capital punishment lodged in the Southern District of New York.
Both counts may receive a capital sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts that include eight counts of crime in support of organised crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "awful, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, suffering and loss to the following families and friends: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the opinion of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a death penalty case in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty imposed in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
He confessed to the investigators that he was happy about what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told authorities that he felt inspired to execute the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
Also, according to the cops, he asked to fly the ISIS flag into the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the public defenders who represented Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to enforce the death penalty, instead of accepting a plea of guilt with life imprisonment, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecution not to apply capital punishment.
A Member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party claims that NIGEL FARAGE must be at the forefront of negotiations on Brexit
Nigel Farage promised today that he would "mobilize the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said politicians must "feel pressure" from the Eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of Theresa May's Parliament who suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, a Conservative Party deputy, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have gone out" by now if Farage was Secretary of the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge that May is facing with regard to the extremely divided camps has been emphasised by members of the Conservative Party who have joined another protest, against leaving the European Union organised in the city.
The prime minister is trying very hard for his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, to work properly, facing attacks from those who support the leaving of the European Union, those who want to remain in it, as well as from the European Union.
The Allies stressed that she would continue to seek an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and would force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her offer and "chaos".
Bone said during the event of the pro-Brexit movement "Leave Means Leave" in Solihull that he wished "to give up the Chequers plan".
He suggested Farage should be part of the team and given responsibility associated with negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were run by him, we wouldn't be in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, representative of the Wellingborough constituency, added: "I will support the Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied suggestions to change public opinion in the 2016 vote: "It is not at all true that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports the Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to people's voices.
"The public disagrees with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it, nor do our activists who go out on the street and who support us, first of all, in the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message aimed at Theresa May, she added: "The prime ministers who keep their position are those who keep their promises."
At the rally, Nigel Farage said that politicians should be put in a position to "feel pressure" if they are about to give up their decision at the 2016 referendum.
"It is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray the Brexit and we are here today to tell them that "we will not let them do this".
In a message conveyed to enthusiastic contentment, he added: "I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the civil army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners saying "The Conservative Party is against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at members of the Conservative Party and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for digitising customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a farce.
The Brexit does not bring benefits," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said she would seriously consider running for president after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts spoke Saturday about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in the November elections against Geoff Diehl, a member of the Republican Party House of Representatives, who was co-chairman of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the heart of speculation that it could defeat Trump in 2020.
The afternoon event in Holyoke on Saturday was the 36th meeting with citizens with voting rights using the city's format since Trump took over as president.
A participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to arrive in Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government, and this includes that a woman is at the head of it.
A suspect has been arrested in the case of the death that caused the death of player Sims from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of the death that caused the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, that he was in possession of a weapon, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 matches, being 10 times in the original team in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's orders would play a key role in the race.
Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the stand and leave Hamilton in line, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the pit one lap later and came from behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after several schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to let the interior open after making a double move to defend himself on the third turn.
Max Verstappen began the race in the rear row of the grid and was in seventh place near the end of the first round, just on the day he was 21.
He then took the lead in a large part of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to overcome Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
Finally, he stopped at the stand at round 44, but could not increase the pace during the last eight laps, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
"It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and acted like a true gentleman, letting me move forward.
And the team has done an excellent job to win over Ferrari and achieve this double," Hamilton said.
A Terrible Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday, as part of a rally on her insistence that she did not facilitate the "deletion" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee, commenting instead that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad, immoral and liars".
"The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and liars," he said.
“When you see that they published and leaked information and then say that they didn’t.
They're not the ones responsible.
Do you remember?
When I asked Dianne Feinstein if she had facilitated the document?
Do you remember her answer?
Uh... no.
I didn't do this."
Well, wait a minute.
We did this?....No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was a "slip" in September, but Feinstein denied that "the leak" occurred from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations concerning Ford, and I am not the one who made it easier to "discharge" her account," Feinstein told the commission, according to Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and that's exactly what I did."
But her denial did not seem to fit the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defence of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to take power in every way possible.
Notice the wickedness, the immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy in order to gain power and control," the president said, according to the Mediate website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars wins 5-3 against Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars paid for Friday's loss in the Elite League, winning against the Belfast Giants in Saturday's return match, with a score of 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-way lead, with the hits being made by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie evened the score before Dwyer returned the Giants to the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard evened the score for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen to secure their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat this season for Adam Keefe's players, who had recovered ground by defeating Dundee by 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's opening performance began in the fourth minute, respectively 3:35, from a pass by Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier, who doubled the team's advantage four minutes later.
In a match that started so dynamically, Sullivan brought the host team back into play at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave Cownie the chance to score for an even score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage before the first break, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first half.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard again equaled an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later, in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen to gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus ensuring that the team was ranked 5th in the ranking, by the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
An air traffic controller died after securing the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after ensuring the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a severe earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong replicas in the area and many people are trapped under the remains of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post in the control tower of Palu's Mutiara Airport, which was shaking heavily.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed he was about to crash.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesman for Indonesia's air navigation service provider said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are saddened by this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency saying there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will increase because many victims are still under the ruins and we have not had access to many of them," said agency spokesman Sutovo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six metres high devastated Palu, with a joint funeral Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings victims.
It is almost impossible to find drinking water.
All mini-markets are being robbed."
Jan Gelfound, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is in a hurry to provide help to survivors, but we do not know what they will find on the ground.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the national army: "Please work day and night to complete all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" CNN announced.
Indonesia was shaken earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which resulted in more than 550 deaths.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia has now declared that one person is missing, after having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger has been missing since Saturday afternoon.
She also noted that she was trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for additional details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
The local boats were used to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and United States Naval Forces said the plane missed the landing strip and ended up in a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses believe the plane has exceeded the end of the runway.
US national passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very short distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers had managed to cross the water, which had reached the waist, and reached the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. naval forces said that sailors working nearby to renovate a wharf jumped to aid, used an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank 30 metres underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents in the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst shows the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed its plea regarding the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used his cell phone records to piece together Quinton Tellis' 29-year-old actions, as well as those of his 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which is in contradiction with his earlier claims, according to Clarion Ledger.
The moment the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was summoned to the witness stand and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he " lied, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defence will begin its closing argument on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide at the end of the day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A trio that plays hip-hop music wants to change the negative way in which this kind of music is seen, with the help of songs with positive messages.
The High Breed band, in Bristol, claims that hip-hop has stopped sending political messages and addressing social issues, as it originally did.
They want to go back to their roots and make the hip-hop aware to be popular again.
A recent renaissance of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the United Kingdom was observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her after she received a "racist" text message.
A New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal for discriminatory reasons after accidentally receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was "another black person".
The couple denied being racist, claiming that she sued them for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she presented herself on the first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOO! ANOTHER PERSON OF COLOUR," he wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing his blunder, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the nanny, who is African-American, had failed to perform her duties properly and expected to receive a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple for compensation for dismissal and claims $350 a day for six months, the period during which she was to live with them and operate, despite the fact that this was done without a contract.
"I want to show them that these things are not done," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is about discrimination."
The couple denied claims that they were racists, saying it was normal to fire Maurice, because they feared that they could no longer trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent him the wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco, her husband, told the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have wronged, even if by mistake?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Viewing the process as an "extortion action", Plasco said his wife would give birth in two months and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person under such circumstances?
This is not being done," the bank investor added.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social networks, judging them for their behavior and logic.
Editors of Paddington's story feared that readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following things about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time before it gets published.
It's very funny now, after seeing that Paddington was a huge success."
She also said that her father, who was a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was a "bittersweet" one after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success she later enjoyed.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he didn't like to brag," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was as if he had a child who had a success: you are proud of him, though it is not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was transported quickly to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to tell me that it is very serious and that he does not think he will survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines administered by doctors so that her heart would continue to pump blood began to diminish and come out of her system.
He had died a little while ago, and the organs were starting to stop working.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning after his daughter's death, boarded the plane with other passengers who did not know what he was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
“I kept my head down and the tears didn’t stop flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming feeling of sympathy with Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two bereaved women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost their loved ones because they killed themselves are trying to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and include telephone numbers that people can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone appreciated his smile.
They always said his smile changed your mood."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he had reached a very unhappy moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Davis said, "I keep thinking you're gonna have a domino effect."
It created the messages “to tell people that they can call someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Extinct yourself, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' friend for several years, lost Mark, the life partner he had for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me that he wasn't feeling well or that he was depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he had changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children opened their presents and didn't even look them in the eye."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but she must overcome it: “It has caused great pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake, following the start of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking for -- a limited and small-scale investigation -- we could have a little unity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the commission was about to "disintegrate," amid a partisan block.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the time factor.
There are only five weeks until the November 6 elections - if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they want to win in the highest court elections in the country will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush kept making calls to the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make the difference in case of a tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives in North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from South Korea's unification ministry, said about 1,127 people fled the country last year, compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by those who illegally transport people across the border.
The Pyongyang has made no public comment.
A vast majority of fugitives from the north are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two sides of Korea.
China considers fugitives to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for a few talks that covered negotiations on denuclearisation.
This took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to work together for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States sanctions of causing a lack of progress since then.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in such situations, under no circumstances will we be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "sisteric", saying he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court as "isteric" and said his temper was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made comments Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared "systerical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal commission, which took place on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes he almost screamed and lost his voice because of his emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated assassination of character", organised by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think she's disqualifying herself with those statements and the way she attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if confirmed and if the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it is not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Columbia District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Accessible Care Law or the Roe versus Wade case, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of overturning certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, "Oh, how wonderful!" Pelosi said.
And women need to be able to handle it.
It's a justified diatribe, it's months and years of accumulated anger and it can't speak without bursting into tears.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman who was in an executive position, who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I was sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
I thought it was a brilliant thing to do."
Tears are allowed to express anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I began to cry because of inexpressible anger, is that I was grabbed by the back of the head by an older woman, a cold director I always felt a little afraid of, and took me down the stairwell.
"She must never see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad to have given you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, who was extremely frustrated, thought she had no reason not to run for president herself.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," she says laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was in the end, she was behind on the fundraiser and swore she wouldn't enter the race if she couldn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000, they only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get discounts?" she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by emotions – due to gratitude for the people who supported it, frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also anger caused by gender discrimination – that she lost her voice because of emotions.
"You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown," Schroeder remembers about the press' reactions to her.
"You'd think one of my sponsors was Kleenex."
I remember thinking about what they'd say on my tombstone.
"Did he cry?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial for Beijing?
The salves that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening and, although it seems to be a long way to go until its end, fighting between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing duties on key Chinese imports, including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new taxes, which affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively applying taxes on half of all goods in China that reach US territory.
Beijing has been avenged every time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10% on US products worth $60 billion.
China has warned that it will respond to every blow by the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly ceding to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, US commercial war pressures could positively support China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would in fact be more dangerous than what has been expected so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, a group of experts.
Syria ready for refugee return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things can get back to normal.
Existing conditions allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at daily life and living.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder 2018 Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National at the edge of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded the sixth consecutive defeat in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe came first after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won 14.5 points, needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial hit in the water to hair 3 at the 16th hole, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari played an incredible performance in all the rounds, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost to the 5th and 4th hole in front of the top European player, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The number one player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost to the 2nd and 1nd holes in Ian Poulter in England, which was probably his last match in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most successful player in Europe, scoring an average of 25.5 points in his entire career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It's teamwork and I'm glad I could be of help," said Garcia, excited after the European victory.
He hands the baton to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game on Sunday.
"I am very proud of beating Tiger Woods. I used to watch his games when I was a kid," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
All weekend, the American team made a real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinarily throughout the tournament.
American team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of them, they really tried.
This morning, there were a few moments when we put pressure on the European team.
We had a hell of a fight.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with PGA of America and our Committee for the Ryder Cup and we'll move on.
I'm fond of these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to give them the proper respect.
They played better than us."
