UN chief says there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has been going on for almost five years and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries on the council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - this month on the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "made this situation unresolved".
Ban asked the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when they were able to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures from the polls that show Donald Trump has a real chance
Some have tried to label him a flip-flop politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others await implosion.
But regardless of how some Republicans try to knock Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it hasn't worked (yet).
Ten out of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump leads by a two-digit percentage and some voices are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate mogul's appointment chances.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says that Trump will win the race for Republican nomination.
Pundits points out that during the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made room for Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And there are many reasons why they would fight hard in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super CAP and the Conservative Economic Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
Here are some figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing matter:
The figures indicating support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive opinion of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These numbers are maintained.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of Republicans in the region have a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for the nomination.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "enthusiastic" compared to 40% who say the same thing about Trump.
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other side, 47 per cent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if the favourite Jeb Bush wins the race for nomination.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticised for his insults and bombastic style, 52% of national Republican voters believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a poll conducted by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
We find the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be the leader, according to a survey conducted by Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44% believe that he does not have the personality to act effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump authentic.
According to a poll conducted by CNN/ORC last week, the question of who has the best chance of winning the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed from the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the nomination race, compared with only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even though the Republicans have turned to another candidate, Trump is still at the top of everything.
Some say that the split situation will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while support against Trump will be divided by more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush, and eventually 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost even with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made up their minds.
A new poll conducted by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, much can happen in this regard, and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the loophole open to change their option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who say they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called the immigrants from Mexico "violators" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the focus of the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will damage rebranding efforts.
However, according to the survey conducted by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it turns out as long as the immigration issue stays in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration towards authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of the Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the survey conducted by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to the detriment of someone experienced in government.
People are also angry with Washington authorities.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Republicans of Congres, with 54% declaring themselves "unsatisfied" and 21% "unnerved".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbin, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, confronting David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to which he is entitled shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely analysed by the media and Labour MPs.
During weekly appearances, he requested "less theatre and more facts".
He also said he could give up a few participations and give them up to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test in leadership, coming after naming a "ghost cabin" and after his speech at the annual TUC congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to remain silent at the national anthem at a service Tuesday on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted criticism from conservative MPs and held the headlines.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem caught attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he "kept the silence respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force at the Battle of England".
However, a member of Mr. Corbin's phantom cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC on Two's Newsnight that he would have recommended that the Labour leader sing the national anthem "irrespective" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the phantom cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leading team, arguing by differences of opinion regarding the economy, defence and foreign, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says the political differences are "accumulating" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment regarding his position towards the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes which would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
Hours later, Labour and Pensions Minister Smith said the party "is very clear" in exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "head" level from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced at the stand in the last decade since he took over the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from foreign sources" for questions to address to Mr. Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentary Islington North said that PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and will refrain from lines and attacks, committing to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Finance, would take his place at the PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr Cameron is moving abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak occasionally, saying he had approached the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the "Punch and Judy" political style often associated with PMQs, but acknowledged a few years later that he had failed in his approach.
Since the first transmission in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he heads the Chamber of Deputies and his position among fellow MPs, although critics say it has become a cartoon and needs profound reform.
"Framework in Joburg": Young homeless people benefit from photography courses
It's difficult to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as a child found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young homeless people to take photos of the areas they live in and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Head of JD Sports says higher wages could harm enlargement
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says an increase in the UK minimum wage could mean "a higher purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that the purchasing power will exceed the higher costs for the company's workforce, he says.
Costs could impact JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis President Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was collateral damage in the "storm" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves more praise than criticism, according to President Tennis Australia Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous slippage Kyrgios had towards Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a fierce qualifying match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to break up Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have knocked Kyrgios down, and I should have knocked this kid down."
Although he was last seen making a dust rocket after having muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was strongly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against England.
"One thing I feel strongly is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a little into conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But let's face it, he handled himself extremely well in pretty challenging situations in the U.S. with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a 19-year-old very mature, he works hard and he has integrated into the team, he had no conflict with the other players, he is highly respected in the locker rooms, he trains hard, he is in excellent shape, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged exclusively on the basis of his qualities and defects.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the important draw match, which begins on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most suitable for all, but supported the long-term return of the Canberra player to the team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw game and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has gone up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he's growing up in front of the public and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a time when he's not in the spotlight to be able to reflect, which is good for both the team and for him.
2016 Elections: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced if he will run for president, is supported by 15% of the democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are stronger in their choice than other candidates' supporters.
Compared to the survey conducted by CBS news last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has narrowed.
Men's support has been considerably reduced and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now tied to Sanders.
However, Clinton still has the upper hand among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with a two-digit percentage among the liberals, but Sanders now has a small five-point lead in this group.
About half of the democratic voters at national level say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters will be excited about its choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not support Clinton today - only about a quarter would support it enthusiastically.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about the first grade, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why they would want her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it is time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
Given that the vice-president is considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57 per cent of the democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third think he should not run.
At the question of the second option for the party's representative, the democratic voters appoint Biden as the majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half claim that Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton the highest candidate to win the general election; but figures fell from 78% last month.
Biden is at a distance in second place but the percentage according to which it is most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems to eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic candidate or possible candidate is seen by these voters as unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well in terms of some key features vis-à-vis their party's primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be integrity and confidence and have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best seen of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrity and confidence, twice as many as those who say that about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not think about him.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders, and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
On all these points, about a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton when she was State Secretary, most democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say it did not affect their general view of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion split in March on the subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy did not affect their general opinion of Clinton, though 36 per cent say they changed their opinion in a negative way.
Mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their view of Clinton in a negative way.
Although the democratic voters consider Clinton to be integrity and confidence, this continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider her integrity and confidence, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it integrity and trust.
At the same time, 55 per cent of voters at national level do not consider Trump to be upright and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders upright is greater than those who do not agree, however, as in Carson's case, many do not have an opinion of him.
The error margin for the 351 primary democratic voters sample is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the brotherhood indicted for the murder of the 1st year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, placed in the back of a 30-pound bag full of sand, and was repeatedly roughed up as he tried to make his way to a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi brotherhood did not call the emergency number after he passed out and claim to have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, president of the brotherhood at national level, to seek his advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their personal belongings and put practically the good of the brotherhood before Michael Deng's good," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by fraternities rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County Grand Jury recommended that the first five members be charged with murder in the third degree.
Another thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be indicted for assault and complicity in murder.
"We want to hold to account not only the people involved but, if there is an organisation that has authorised the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Faculty of Baruch banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve increases the interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will stumble, return on bonds will increase and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In the economy, history gives little indication of time frame.
After the first increase in the interest rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The fact that the Federal Reserve is aggressive in increasing interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That is why US central bank officials stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when the interest rate starts to rise but on the trajectory of the time needed for normalisation.
Indeed, there are multiple variables at stake.
However, in the end, market players may find that all the excitement about the interest rate increase has been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era "cheap money," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, on a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal levels, but still small, to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effect.
Here is how several sectors of the economy could react, building on historical trends:
Given the situation faced by the market in recent months, anticipation of the increase in the interest rate may make things volatile for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a trend that the return on capital will stagnate for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect again the phase out of monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed increases.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has suddenly increased - by about 14 percent - moving towards an increase in the interest rate, quite invariable in the period of 250 days after (average climb of 2.6%) and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the head strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said the impact on the shares tended to become more pronounced later in the interest rate cycle and the benefits are beginning to decrease.
The recession is a reality of economic life, but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing conditions that did not exist before and could speed up a recession.
In particular, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
The increase in the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time it is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing all year for a Fed growth decision, all eyes being set on this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in the interest rate during this meeting, term transactions show a probability of only 25%.
"In our study after 1950, all interest rate growth cycles so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, with GDP eclipsed peaks before the recession very quickly after recovery began," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than for shares when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it appears that benefits change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate growth cycle, the return on bonds is falling immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategies are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will bring profitability closer between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-efficiency bonds do better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing profitability," Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab, said in a review.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"Besides the dollar's power and the expected decline in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the return curve is fairer, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies operating mostly in the US will benefit from the interest rate increase and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the dollar growth will lead to the increase in their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate increase," analyst Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Firms with strong balance sheets exceeded those with a poor balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital receipts as well as low volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Duty will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the dollar increase.
Those who save could also benefit, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station for "stupidly"
He says he is increasingly similar to his commercial opponent
He also took a look at the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized the Brits Awards
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that this show isn't original either
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming into" Classic FM, an important MP said, putting pressure on the air to prove he's doing something commercial stations don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the heads of the BBC that the public radio station is "stupid" and increasingly resembles the commercial opponent.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 is "stupid" - although I don't like to use the word - but I have the impression that it is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took a look at the BBC Music Awards, released last December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, appear to be Brits under another name.
So if you try to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that only make copies of what already exists on the market," Mr Bingham said.
The director-general of the BBC denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 is well ahead of his commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out about the classical music I hear from Radio 3 anywhere.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and allocating new pieces," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he had to do more to attract audiences from the previous period because the British had less knowledge of classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element under the BBC logo criticised during a meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would follow in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's talent show from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about the show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be performed "in a BBC-specific manner."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find the hen with golden eggs in its own backyard" the next time it launched an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban taking on new seasons in The Voice in the future or to spend the money that goes on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales peaked in August and could be guilty of Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month, there has been the slowest increase since 2000.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of a mobile phone to shop.
Experts believe that the November Black Friday could lead to reluctance to spending.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned UK commercial streets into ghost cities.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales are decreasing, with the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August showed the lowest growth since 2000, with an increase of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, with the latest figures showing an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalise over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when buyers started using their mobile phone to shop.
Thus, the number of people who could shop online increased and could do so under various circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it's stalling a little bit, you might notice a decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
According to specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers crammed in front of computers to get their hands on the offers, which led to the collapse of several retailers' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers fought on bargains, could cause the buyer's reluctance.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 of every £5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently made via online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to go to fashion shops in commercial areas.
After sanctioning the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury victims killed after the Mecca crane collapse.
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked through the streets by Muslims, the first funeral taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partly blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
Health Minister said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane collapsed
In the street-walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crashed crane at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, mourners joined on the road to express their condolences until the first dead reached the end of the final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad memory kept by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on believers.
The bodies were released for burial after the king of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family's construction group for disaster, which also resulted in 394 wounded.
In the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed by a crashed crane at the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, of Bolton, Great Manchester, on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still reaching the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi press agency, said the Binladin Group bears partial blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not disclose the detail, but said the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the crane and representatives of the Group could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using up-to-date safety measures and not coordinating its work with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and has been conducting major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegated" son, disowned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in strong wind and rain, just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided that relatives of the deceased would receive one million Saudi Rials (174,000 pounds) and the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of that amount.
Benefits and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
Two offers to convert loans into Swiss francs into MDL have already appeared on the banking market, the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to data accumulated by finzoom financial portal analysts, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest rate on lei, 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the offer to convert Banca Transilvania was accepted by 83% of the clients with loans in francs due to the second successive discounts: the balance with the value of the risk and management fees paid by the client was reduced, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their customers, compared to how much they paid equivalent monthly in lei before the conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the next years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the CHF credits covresion in lei is that foreign exchange risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from future increases of the franc, and the credit reimbursement will be made in the currency in which he collects his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no reassessment of property, no further guarantees and no further proof of income.
Practically, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit, nor will there be any additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Also, both banks offer a discount on the monthly rate, compared to how much customers paid before conversion, equivalent to lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is made up more of the interest, and the customer repays very little of the principal.
The Bankpost offer with very low interest rates in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
But it is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in lei with variable interest rate is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the next years (more than Libor - CHF).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days since 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer, may also occur.
The time has come to decide on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks forward to a meeting scheduled in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether or not to increase interest rates for the first time after about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with 80 economists, just over half of whom last week believed the decision would be made, I now believe the situation will continue for a while and interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-2.25 per cent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could give up zero rates and initiate a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, with recovery bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the global situation less pink.
He warned markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Stars Who Lost Their Charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has experienced stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his lifelong partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor was confronted with the problem of drug use and in 2008 was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this is definitely cost-effective.
Player Luke Shaw from Manchester United stands on the stand for months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in the Manchester United Champions League match, which ended with a defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep him on the stand for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred as a result of a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20, broke the PSV defense.
He got medical attention for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow, or maybe the day after, then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, has difficulty, then he plays fantastically, and now something like this happens.
He had his oxygen mask in his locker.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but at double fracture rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Looks like Moreno got lucky and got rid of the red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it's foul and red card.
It was a very nasty, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I feel, I'm starting my way to recovery, I'm going to come back stronger."
Similar news Manchester United struck by Luke Shaw's injury in defeat at PSV
England's quarterback has one more reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "This is a very bad injury."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to harm an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexican national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It is very difficult for him because he did not intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear that it is a very serious injury, it is not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see it.
All I could see was the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In his statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel so bad, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission, but he's still holding on.
Victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the England team selected for the tournament, I do not consider a 3-0 win repeat in the test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate any version of a victory in the distance.
Alastair Cook’s team may have less experience than three years ago but they have good spin players in the batting line and collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the 2012 events but will have a positive youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if unknown at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Similar topics: Adam Lyth left England's team for the test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, as his head coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth as a team.
He played the seven test matches against two good strikers in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by the results.
There were no questions about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this before - players are their own selections.
About fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run, but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope that if you make more run for Yorkshire you will get other opportunities.
England's lead coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when his performance was out of line and I'm not surprised by that; first of all, he's a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question in how long a batsman is noted in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs -- like Sam Robson before him -- while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got lucky at home and away.
The only dissatisfaction you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in top shape - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
On the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman I'm very good with.
He is a cricketer who has "X factor" and which I noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but this will of course depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea was launched for Moeen to open up with Cook, which would lead to extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already proved he's a piece of shit.
Moeen may not have brought success to his district of Worcestershire, but it was number three for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches 38 as first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in as a team on the back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his young age -- with an average of 31 at bat and 35 at ball -- and they might think it's punt, but there aren't a bunch of spinners, and the selection has opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England also made some changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman of Sri Lanka, as the consultant for the test matches could be a master shot.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in every situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes the new voices in the locker room, even if they send messages that have been sent before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes rests for the one-day games, Root received a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and selections do not make the program.
And you have to remember, the players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
The Brexit camp could win if the economy remains calm until 2017
Every day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse, even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corbyn at the head of the Labour Party or TUC on Tuesday brings serious criticism towards Europe.
Foreigners also have characters like Corbin and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained the past few days that - immersed in crises similar to that in the EU - not all domestically challenged - some Member States are fuelled by Britain's agenda of concessions and amendments to treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, at the annual meeting, TUC decided that they did not want to do so either if they eroded social protection.
We might even call it Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor attend summits or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and say they have won allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with an external perspective under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - suggests that several ministers and obtuse officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor of extreme caution, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave her position before her situation falters, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - something they don't want either because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers may even plan to make remarks intentionally that do not help, in the SNP style, in the campaign for the UK referendum in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"Renegotiation was fixed" and "Great Britain obtained nothing of value from renegotiation".
Europeans know on their own how catchy Fleet Street can be and how skeptical are the oligarchic press barons who view the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn that ratified our entry in 1973 in the 2:1 report.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was a Brussels correspondent.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of tax-free rogues, foreigners who were phone fraud and pseudo-domes who own most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them about the same, but he realized that when you're locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, given that Blair made a concession to the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on the back on Monday at Westminster -- I told him to stop wasting his time with me -- seems to be in danger of adopting the Murdoch strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock in the '80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it needs to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose position at the BBC left it on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call evolution.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most people who disagree with conservative "anglicism" might agree to that.
That's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the scout in him struggled not to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbin as shadow minister on financial matters was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the '70s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his position in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
However, the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said or what JC told colleagues and lawmakers during his private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he has touched me too - the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the whirlwind of social networks, an outbreak of paranoia and betrayal.
It is fair not to grant Cameron a ticket of favor in Europe, allowing him to take good support of Labour in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the basic sophism of McDonnell and Corbyin regarding EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophism on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant about the fact that JC will not campaign for renunciation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the poor military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the decision of the UK Public Health Department on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some with ties in the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) editorial team joined Lancet in criticising evidence used by the British Department of Public Health (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
Several researchers, however, questioned the robustness of the data and pointed fingers at links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the Lancet medical journal attacked the "extraordinarily fragile base" on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in BMJ questioned their claims and their foundation "on solid ground or quicksand".
Martin McKee, European Public Health Professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said they expect PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In reality, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) summarising their views on the negative effects associated with various nicotine products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study in the past.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting said the funding received from an electronic cigarette producer was not the funding that there are reports that he received from the tobacco and cigarette company, Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but among them are some known "frontiers" in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare in the paper the financing of the industry.
Other participants in the meeting are not known for their tobacco control expertise.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the PHE tobacco control station.
The group's research work "convincingly covers" the lack of "solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have according to most criteria," McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department of PHE, says that the claims in BMJ have been answered in the past.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two people who have smoked their whole lives loses their lives because of this addiction.
All evidence suggests that the risk of electronic cigarettes for health is comparatively minor, but we must continue to study long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of the information that emerges and does not emerge from evidence, especially in view of the high degree of public confusion about the relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking amount to £2 billion.
By clearly expressing the current evidence - namely that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not risk-free, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfil our national duty.

Adverts that shame Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's film against the arms fair.
Terrible killer drones!
Ankle-crushing irons!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric sticks that cause creepy pain without leaving a trace!
The cheery voice and animated images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a fierce charade by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities' desire to sell armaments to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign has also led to a large number of posters being displayed at bus stations and subway stations that need a second look.
"Important announcement, are you traveling with DLR between September 15 and 18?" says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London subway, the DLR line turning into a tank image.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will pounce on DLR Customers to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are made by artists who have exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum, in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", a six-pound Allen key package that says "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in bus stations on the planet."
London transport is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of flywheels.
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are asking more and more questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving towards collaboration with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that greets subway commuters.
Amnesty's film had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the armament fair -- with an empty space in the ExCel calendar -- and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with a more realistic ad, but "enriching it with powerful animations and colors was more striking".
"They did a great job helping us increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the fair," Tom Davies says on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the subject of the arms fair comes from inside ExCel, where exhibitors offer fantastic products of euphemistics.
In a press release, Saab leaked an order from the US Army on "AT4CS RS with shoulder-support launcher."
This includes “a unique - shaped warhead that delivers amazing effects behind the armor inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules to Live in the Home
It's been 11 years since I moved into the dorm, when I was a 19-year-old boy who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I pissed off -- and the numerous complaints about others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the dorm can bring states that vary from nervous breakdown to horror.
The chatter is tempting: telling people where you came from, if and where you spent a year away from your studies, what do you think of Corbyn and why "truly, it's indifferent to Marmite because, really, it's nothing but HAHAHA yeast extract, you find me in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe too - ask questions and show interest.
These animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from the ones you wouldn't talk to even if the flood came and they were the only ones with boats.
Don't smother people.
Bedrooms often abound with drinking parties, movie nights and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress and try on their underwear.
Similar topics: Don't even think about starting a student life in a relationship
Introverts get special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes there is built a culture of wandering through bedrooms, based on friendship, socialization and lifelong friendships.
All this can be terrible for someone trying to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want us to be friends, but I want you to leave to recover the energy that I have spent interacting with you."
Try to notice when a colleague is exhausted from socializing - and try to send a text instead of knocking on the door.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy who lived in the same dorm with me had a policy that said if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen enough things.
Make friends cooking.
Since you start the university in Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to get acquainted and take a plate of brownies, it seems less strange, less like the situation in the '50s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked something for you, now smile and I ask personal questions."
Homemade goods are a great way to make friends.
Your settlers will feel compelled to talk and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you must be a good cook.
The lumps of flour, sugar and fat will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, stealing someone's chicken is stealing, but taking a drop of milk to put in your tea is still stealing?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to help yourself even if it boils on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you - you're still trying to tackle the problem more maturely than my roommate, who has colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
Don't make noise that won't let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it's common sense, but because you literally walk on glass.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to turn the music down because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to turn the music up.
When they finally turned off the music at 5 a.m., the girl was kind enough to sleep for two hours before turning on the music, she locked the door and left for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/wife moved on the same floor?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely strange if you confused a fellow landing party with your future husband, hooked up, split up, and met each other every day and maybe even watched him take over all of your mutual friends?
Of course, you can't resist the heart - but if a sexy fellow landing is certainly not your future husband, try to be rational.
At the exciting moment when you realize that someone left their keys in the unlocked room, the line between prank and intimidation is smoother than it looks.
A good prank is funny, but it can distort in a few moments.
You teach a funny and valuable lesson about safety by hiding something - but you never soil someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't attach someone's belongings to the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: There were no world tournaments in Bach’s era.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, quite "weird", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance, on Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one Monday, when in the foreground was the cellist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu being undisturbed.
Both performances, performed on the stage of the Athenaeum, showed the audience a different way of playing classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 as the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - they talk about musicians, not composers.
They're formed as "specialized workers".
They themselves think they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all the musical fetishization focuses on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and an audience who can't listen, but must look, which is stupid again," David Grimal said.
The violinist tells that this change in the way he makes music came from his "musical deceptions" in his lead career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
So I couldn't find any sense to continue on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This was in 2004, and at that time no one did this without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects".
"How do you imagine doing marketing with a group of musicians in which there is no ego?" asks the artist.
David Grimal admits that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor did not prove to be a hindrance in the musical act: "Inquisitively, the more complex we sing a repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role", says Grimal, adding that to the Sunday show "we were 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave" one, precisely because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the greatest orchestras in the world are present, and three times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited this strange group as well."
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there was a place and interest for something different that breaks barriers.
Speaking about Enescu's work, the violinist admits to feeling the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced works by Enescu in his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal advocates the change in the way classical musical education is made, considering that "the musician's job, as it is organized today, has a death wish" and that "the future music represents the music itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it doesn't help.
There were no world tournaments in Bach’s era.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, they are all great, extraordinary, but as long as they are performed in the service of music.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, it has no freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example to Romanian products before and post accession to the European Union: "In Romania, before you entered the EU, you had vegetables and good meat".
To enter the EU you had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture end up in the service of supermarkets, as in France.
With music the same thing happens, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes tomatoes maybe not too pretty, but when we cut them they're real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce his learning in school, we would reintroduce concerts on TV and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products," Grimal believes.
Surely, there are things in classical musical education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician to a soldier, or whether we form a musician who will play an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it has to be somehow, if we want to form a musician, it is something else.
In your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asks the French artist smiling.
Grimal looks like, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes from exceeding this status of "soldier", exceeding what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert they come out smiling".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist within the "Ideas Festival", a discussion with the public organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
Profile David Grimal
After following the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the direction of Regis Pasquier, the period when he received advice and encouragement from famous artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed the course of his life.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, along which he has held regular concerts in the last 20 years on the main classical music scenes of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as Orchestra de Paris, Orchestra Philharmonique de Radio France, Russian National Orchestra, Orchestra National de Lyon, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Berliner Symphony, New Japan Philharmonic, Orchestra de l'Opera de Lyon, Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Sinfonia Warsaw, under the leadership of conductors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schånwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos and Peter Eotvos, Andris Nelsons, Christian Arming.

Besides his solo artist career, David Grimal also wanted to explore more personal projects.
The freedom offered by his collaboration with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe by venturing into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Alongside Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts for the benefit and along with homeless people at the Saint-Leu church, in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been an artist in the Residency at the Dijon Opera House.
He taught violin at the Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also holds many master classes and was a member of the jury of the International Long-Thibaud Competition in Paris in 2010.
He received the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres distinction from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal played on a 1710 "ex-Roederer" Stradivarius, but also on "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by French clayer Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal attended this year's George Enescu International Festival with the Les Dissonances Orchestra on Sunday, Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances went on the stage on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "The Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the greatest challenge for children: doubling two characters in the super production "The Snow Queen 3D"
You have a super-talented and spontaneous kid who likes movies?
Give him a chance to be a star.
In September, during the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is searching for "The Small Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If classical drawings emphasize the actor's voice to the specific character of the animated character, lately, the creation of the story also takes into account those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well known actors.
Cinema City Romania wants to discover new voices and therefore we are starting a new campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the lines are funny.
"The children will have fun and will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, between 11 September and 30 September, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection, which will give 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to audition in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the small voices platform.cinema-city.ro, where to enroll the child in the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Later, they have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will register by performing his own version of the doubling.
Four films about friendship, fairy-tale heroes, magic and hope can choose the contestants to support the challenge: "Yellow Feather 3D", "Moune: Guardian of the 3D Moon", "Blinky Bill: Koala cel ogre 3D" and "Albinuta Maya 3D".
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double one character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Snow Queen", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, tax projections for 2016 fall
FedEx declared disappointing results for the last quarter, with the delivery giant reducing profit estimates for the year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would employ 50,000 seasonal holiday workers.
The company's shares fell by about 2.5 per cent in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the sound of Wednesday's opening bell.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts predicted $10.84, according to a survey conducted by the FactSet.
The decreasing estimate comes despite price increases of 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher surcharges for land transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply since November.
The company said it still expects gains to increase compared to the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Director General Fred Smith said that "the company is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially in terms of global production and trade."
Holiday employment plans were announced a day after UPS contestant said he plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of jobs he did last year.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx won $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
The winnings per share were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per share by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit rose by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, leading to the stagnation of revenues from its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping picked up the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the incomes of the Ground Division increased by 29% but operational revenues stagnated virtually due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher basic tariffs, while revenue from the Freight division decreased due to rising costs.
At the pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx's shares had fallen by $3.85 or 2.5% to 150.15.
On Tuesday they had dropped 11 per cent year-on-year and 17 per cent from their peak record on June 11th.
At the most expected meeting in recent years, the Federal Reserve policy makers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany meal to decide whether the time has come to increase a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank meeting room, a mural painting of the United States will be seen.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Central Bank received a double task from Congress: maximising the employment rate in the US and maintaining price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be debated by the unprecedented incentive provided by the near zero short-term interest rate in force as of the end of 2008.
Although most data indicate a strong growing economy, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed officials of adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will pursue," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on the Fed's decision, which in itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of the economists polled by Bloomberg recently anticipated an increase in interest rates this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to postpone, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall in the stock exchange if the Fed increases the interest rate, unless policymakers would mitigate the blow by promising that it would be a long time before the next increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228,89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599,85.
The wind has been triggered by expectations that Fed decision-makers will keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for the Fed to increase the interest rate at this point," Lonski said.
If the Fed makers were to do so, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets".
Other experts said an increase in the interest rate would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slowly tightening monetary conditions that would confirm the force of US recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that he expected an increase in the interest rate this year despite objections raised by liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth was strong this year.
Unemployment dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wages showed signs of growth.
And while inflation has continued to fail to reach the annual goal of the central bank, Fed decision-makers said that a key reason was the temporary effect of falling oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to enter fibrillations later this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 16% below the record peak reached in May, as investors feared that slowing down the Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
The market has somewhat recaptured this month, with the Dow index now about 10% below the May peak.
For Fed decision-makers, the turmoil in the market is added to the complex calculation of the interest rate increase moment.
"Without what has happened in the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be firmer at the hearing," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now he expects to wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a great deal of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy and they almost have no data to base on after the events in China," Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
The mere reference of the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department of the welfare management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, said this month that "Fed has an oversized reaction history to changes in the financial market that appear to be unrelated to economic bases."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the interest rate increase, provided as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that affected Asia caused the Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "Despite the implications of limited identification for the development of the US," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials returned to the fallout.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee, said.
The last hectic period is nowhere near that level, he said.
"We certainly do not want to be in a situation of fear of an increase in interest rates because the markets are upset," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds its double mandate and does not mention financial stability and until something changes in this respect, I do not think that it should take premature action.
Are you looking for a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/deposit opened/open in 1997 belongs to LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/storage is a universal shop that offers an amazing range of fresh, frozen and dehydrated products, popular Thai and Asian snacks and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's also a car station where you have to buy some motor oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to go through all the lanes.
If you get hungry from buying so much, eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The store’s inner food district (good, affordable) is close to homes and offers several options of dishes that can be taken in packs.
What does it have in stock: Do you need anything -- any-- Thai?
You'll probably find it at LAX-C.
Products have reasonable prices and certain items are sold wholesale.
Fresh products include herbs, fruit and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat district is large, and so is the fish section - the staff that serves will clean and fillet the fish and even fry it if you want.
An important part of the store is dedicated to the huge freezer district, where you will find curry leaves, watermelon and frozen ginger, whole ducks, fish, blood and beef balls, pig carcasses, fish meatballs, traditional sausages, semi-cooked and more.
Who buys from there: The owners of restaurants and chefs, also families and individuals.
On wide lanes can fit both shopping carts and fork carts.
Discovery: fresh Durian fruit right next to the house area.
Where it is: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own common parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although there is a chance that the store will be crowded, there is usually no difficulty in finding a parking space.
Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite attempts by the Nine channel to broadcast on Today's Show about changing party leadership
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's urgent move to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of changes in the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of the Nine Canal aired from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Army, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of several weeks, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "cruelness" of the distance did not seem to matter much to the viewers of Aussie TV, Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283.000) but figures were lower than last Thursday (343.000).
Today has reduced the difference from Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise was 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged from 40,000 to 50,000.
For the time being, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349.000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened throughout the morning.
This morning, it is not only Parliament that is affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!
Published by TODAY Monday, 14 September 2015
The main story was the amazing debut of the 800 Words series with former star of Packed to the Afterrs, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, on the subject of a recently widowed father, who decided to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson could handle a show on his own, without the star of the Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The audience results for last night answered resoundingly as "yes".
Seven's X Factor show was held in position, with 1,136 million viewers, taking the faces of The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new general culture show had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 p.m. to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613.000).
Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia's ratings on the second evening will give Nine tacit confidence that the Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to beat McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mihail Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested at a gunpoint at a Siberian airport.

4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
Violence occurred Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 280km west of Kathmandu capital.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired shots in the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not clear immediately why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent clashes on August 10th,
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in centrally governed Nepal for hundreds of years.
The procedure for drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
In Kathmandu this week, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The prime minister continues to exchange lines with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of Wednesday's government meeting, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm stance on the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all the institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania disagrees and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or police with weapons.
"It is a shame for Europe's 21st century to apply methods from the 30s." said Victor Ponta
"The prime minister also said that all data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and set at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." the prime minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% cyclone probability south of Cape Verde Islands
A large front of low pressure about 560km south of Cape Verde's southernmost point is likely to turn into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Centre said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure front about halfway between Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles is also 60% likely to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful for mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight loss surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those undergoing non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralise mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgeon, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the hunger sensation and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of weight measurement relative to height, is considered normal within the range 18.5-24.9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMC by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used the data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in sleeve - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in surgical patients decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatments against diabetes remained almost at the same level, i.e. 29.
Of those who had surgery, diabetes was completely cured at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the medically treated group, by comparison, diabetes mellitus was completely cured in only 1% and partially in only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors concluded.
Researchers also monitored the blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
But in the medically treated group, it remained at about 8%.
However, this improved “blood glucose control” – reflected by improved levels of haemoglobin A1c – did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the gastrectomy arm, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), experienced greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and were more likely to have complete diabetes remission (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of high-weight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery were approximately 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients undergoing surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic aspect for people with BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the point where this work is critical because it says that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously when the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we urge people to take this seriously," she said.
I think once they've accumulated these genetic changes that have shorted out their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it's extremely hard to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader sent a call to end the violence in the refugee mother countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Oxford Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of every nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to worry about a few thousand refugees, but we also need to think about long-term solutions to bring genuine peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries," he stressed.
After all, we need to think of ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11th terrorist attacks, saying the US violent response generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of September 11th, I sent my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-poison Centre, US anti-poison centres reported an increase of around 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed high alcohol-containing hand detergent.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgia Anti-poison Centre, cases of ingestion of hand detergent in children under 12 years of age reported at anti-poison centres went from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said that some children intentionally drink detergent and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
You can watch movies on YouTube that show teenagers how they drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It seems that teenagers have mixed the detergent with mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted to the attractive smell of detergent.
"A child doesn't think he's hurting her," Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are perfumed ones.
Strawberry-flavored hand cleaners, grape, orange are the most attractive for children.
Hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poison center at Kansas University Hospital, for Channel Fox 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand cleaners in accessible places, and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four strawberry-flavored hand sprays at school, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had alcohol levels 179, twice as high as the threshold at which an adult is legally considered under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor at the emergency room who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was babbling and couldn't walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic wet products or wipes and leave the hand detergent out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent containing an unreported toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in northern New York plotted to poison their "bad" teacher by "putting antibacterial products in the classroom", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned it in her classroom.
The police considered the plan to be "unsigned" and put forward the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.

The absence of Scots in the title race bores Dutchmen - by Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic - for not fighting for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, now ambassador of Ajax, said: "In Holland I no longer submit the summary of Celtic matches; why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there.
Here, it's not just about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together and that's where the interest goes.
The tension is high in Old Firm matches and it is not only the Scottish who want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic was struggling hard, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League were followed by the defeat against Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now at the top of the rankings with a five-point lead.
But Deila said: "Celtic had periods before and will recover".
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
So do we - but we have to move on.
We really need Celtic's support because that makes players better, too.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Warburton's prudence regarding January transfers
Despite comments just weeks ago suggesting that he had identified several targets for January transfers, the head of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he does not want to affect the unit of the Ibrox team.
The former head of Brentford said: "The January transfer period is very different from the summer one."
In the case of players transferred in summer, there is the period before the season when they can be integrated, which you could see this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring players that aren't necessary.
Celtic targets Michu after retirement
The Swansea Striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested he could withdraw on expiry of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player struggled for two years with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts faces the SFA on Neilson's comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and they lost 3-2, but the quarterback's red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken for granted after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh in March 2014 before a derby with Edinburgh in Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment," said the striker, adding, "I don't need to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts the management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United Council still trusts that the management team will change the situation - but agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We will bring the boys back in shape," Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for "dirty victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that the Aberdeen team must desperately cling to Hamilton Accies in order to achieve the seventh successive victory in the league, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the first round penalty strike by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won anything, in a cup or league, and that has not won matches like this."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as Britain rises
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 in May-July, while the number of unemployed in the UK overall increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.5% higher than in the UK, according to the figures presented by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland decreased by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number of those currently employed being 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It has been almost a year since Scotland made its historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
Over these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with employment rates rising and unemployment falling.
Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma?
Today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a hall for observers in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary execution room and I'll see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, the idea terrifies me.
So, why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can witness executions in America and, because applications usually exceed the number of seats available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
The elect will view the execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I developed my own connection to him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a notebook and a pen with me to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma Twittered me for compromising my impartiality.
Here's your lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he wishes, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that "he could have phrased it better," but still thinks I'm wrong.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't if you asked me.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international report to be present to write about the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that we've done.
I'm not going back to all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think he's very likely not to be guilty of murder.
I believe with certainty that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'm going to watch him die from this perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to watch a man I like die needlessly.
Peter Moody claims that the stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to retreat from the races.
Peter Moody claimed that the Racing Victoria stewards tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the races.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the elimination of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do the best for racing and that he was put in a difficult situation when it comes to Lidari's cobalt test, for which he had no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words about spy statements and did not want to resemble "the fox that does not reach the grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that, and I kept quiet for a long time but sometimes you get to such a high level of frustration that everything suddenly bursts," Moody said.
It's been known to continue.
Sometimes you react and you have to face the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep it off.
I want to go head-on, and I want the owners I work with to see that I'm trying to give them the best.
As soon as they start to think that this isn't happening, I have to give up my job as a trainer.
At that point, I'm gonna have to figure out what to do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody dropped the bomb in an interview for racing.com where he said the integrity department was trying to spy on his stables.
"18 months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whose name I will tell if asked - and offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
He obviously thinks I'm a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of the RVL, David Moodie, current President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Am I supposed to think it's personal?
Is it necessary for the RVL to start having backbones and to hold people outside trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is that how bad my influence on the industry is?
Maybe that's how the others see it.
Maybe they need to take my license and get me out of the way and I have no doubt that the statements they're making now might cause them to think about this.
But I've come to the point where I don't care anymore and it makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on and I'll get them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
Frustration of the trainer increased with the long investigation into cobalt testing involving Lidari and elimination led him to say he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training the undefeated Black Caviar champion, labeled the treatment rule on the day of the race as "ridical" after a mud or clay cataplasm was applied to the horses' legs, which violates the rules.
He's breaking the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which is what happened.
It happened the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment on the day of the race consisting of the application of the cataplasm, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who struck and fled from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by a hit-and-run.
The rider was flown by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, and was seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police representatives say the driver did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
It appears he will be charged with fleeing the scene of the accident, not providing first aid and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to opponents in their wrestling charges.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called criticism of the plating tactics used by his team as "distorted subjects" brought up by the two main favorites in the NRL.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the referees allowed Storm players to "swallow" their team in Storm's nervous win in the qualifier finals in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos's coach, Wayne Bennett, made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the North Queensland Cowboys qualifying match on Saturday night, when he called the game a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said the Queensland two teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of his team's plating tactics and said the players simply focused on "contact" when they liked it.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two major coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried Storm would defeat them.
"And things don't stop here -- we didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything all year in our defense systems or techniques, except that in the last six weeks we've really put the emphasis on contact in placards and so we've changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so he's probably not used to losing, and it was a shock to him.
Funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding Bennett's mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of winning the championship in 2010 playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He argued by comparing his Saturday night game with our game on Friday night and talked about how exciting the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism because it was a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't give a shit.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider exciting football, especially because of the fast young midfielders.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you've got players like that.
He made this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his game style - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like this.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and the Roosters was a more fierce match related to the score than the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, haven't I seen it yet, what was the score?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, is that exciting?
Or is it exciting to pause and not score?
They're plans for me.
If they're talking about us, it means at some point we could meet them.
Storm has this weekend off because they won the right to play at home either with the North Queensland Cowboys or with Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday's prelim finals at AAMI Park, with tickets on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the little girls' phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping and then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images of children as a subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
He looked into his phone and found the disturbing messages and immediately alerted his mother.
After arriving, police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at the address and found "disquieting" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of children.
Hogg claimed he did it to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretending to be a cop to scare them off".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: "He declared it an addiction - that he is addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did it because he wanted to pose as a cop to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and about asking the person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said that he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and wants to see pictures of rapes and murders.
Mr Robertson added: "When the little girl found the messages on her phone, she cried out to her mother and was trembling and crying.
The little girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the defendant was using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last June 14th, Hogg, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to allegations that he had taken or taken indecent pictures of children, and violated parole conditions on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court at the appearance of 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim demanded that Hogg not be registered in the sex offenders' register because it can be said that this crime "didn't involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
It was entered in the sex offenders' register before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell down the steps of a podium.
He was not injured, however, but the video of the fall became viral on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by opposition representatives who said they had received anonymous death threats, threatening to boo Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but is entitled "Death", he told journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the lawmakers concerned that immunity applies only to Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer of value.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "worried" about threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 layoffs.
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the services sector.
This year. HP will split into two companies, separating the division of computers and printers from corporate hardware operations and fulminant growing services.
Expected layoffs will cost around $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable cost structure," said Meg Whitman, the president and general manager of HP, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today and will have a broad business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of firms to the new business style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and "focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions" to companies.
It splits a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the work of producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the "Silicon Valley cradle".
HP went through a massive reorganisation to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, as the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching the peak in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign against Unfortunate Life (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy mood", his chances of recovery are doubled.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends reduces the likelihood of mental disorders by half.
Of course, for friendship to work, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even though it is really isolation that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which affects our mental health even more deeply.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it focused attention on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when they watch football in the comfortable armchairs and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even though they often avoid fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: ..."My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often people who appeal to us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to handle yourself is powerful, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
No matter how much objective, external intervention helps, through the phone, people in times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you attend this weekend at the FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the full play of the set to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG to remove Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edison Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored in his debut match in the Champions League on Tuesday and helped PSG to take on the Swedish Malmo team.
Next we present the chronicle of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edison Cavani did their duty, with Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of Champions League matches, with a peaceful 2-0 victory over Malmo in the match at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before securing their advantage with the goal scored by Cavani in the 61st minute.
Arriving in Group A alongside Real Madrid and Chehtior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the aim of the French team is not only to qualify in the optimums but also to improve the journey to the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting the opportunity for goal and then being replaced by his hometown team and club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so the 2-0 victory gives our opponents problems and makes a comfortable difference to the next class, even though there are still aspects that we need to improve throughout the season," Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I am sorry that we failed to score one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after one of three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 home draw from Bordeaux in Liga 1 over the weekend, but Di Maria took over the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who would take the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he swerved at Marco Verrati's pass behind Malmo's defense before he shot incrediblely over Johan Wiland in the long corner to the right of the gate.
But if anyone expected the PSG to win by snapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team holders, with a defense of five men and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot, which passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed the pace several times, giving some unnecessary passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts in the first half and was replaced by Cavani just after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilled at supporting his colleagues, with Di Maria's pass being the one he sent in a shot diverted by Wiland over the gate in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of the match was passed, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's run.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hope that they would rebalance the score, and only a superb remote Wiland stop for the rejection of David Luiz maintained the final score before the new Ezequiel Lavezzi entered a void in the extensions.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that the PSG was a class over and that "The last game we played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I've only played in the league in Sweden, which doesn't live up to the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Hats off to the PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion from stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, struck by the drop in stock prices on the stock market, raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a comprehensive plan for massive debt reduction.
Glencore, quoted on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is slamming down prices on the stock market, because the decline in China's economic activity influences demand and causes disaster in markets.
The preferential subscription right increased the price of Glencore's shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday's morning transactions.
The shares increased by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings to the FTSE 100 index, which opened to a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore revealed the sale of shares worth $2.5 billion as part of larger plans to cover almost a third of his $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than the closing price on Tuesday.
He took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the growth of the prolonged stagnation Chinese economy has led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20-40%.
Xi urges wider expansion of the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reforming group that the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth.
"China must commit to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies," Xi said at the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and give way to economic growth, Xi said.
The Governing Group adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, easing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganising the residents registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity where investment is not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through test programmes.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a business environment based on legislation and providing wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their businesses.
China will also, according to the declaration, allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign investment companies and provide them with better services," as stated.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimising requirements and fluidising the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing lawyers' right of practice and educating judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli attended the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, dissatisfied with the Government's proposal to raise wages by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the Education trade unions have not achieved any results, the Government proposing a 10% salary increase, from 1 December, with payment on 1 January 2016, and the trade unions wanted a 15% increase since November or a 20% increase since December.
The discussions took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister of Education Sorin Cimpeanu, Finance Minister Eugen Teodorovici and Labour Minister Rovana Plumb.
The Government's proposal today did not please us, otherwise we would not have ended up in a position to summon the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent we were promised today is less than what we expected.
"In fact, this 10 percent is the money that we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government, last year, for 2016," said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the discussions.
Ponta: In the future health and education will be the areas where we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI, which will also be attended by representatives of the Government to present the country's confederation representatives with the proposal to raise the salary, and the unionists will decide whether to accept the Executive's offer.
The prime minister also told the unionists that the Government is trying to send the Wage Law to Parliament as quickly as possible, so that it can enter into force on December 1st.
The normative act provides for the increase of salaries in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, the increase stipulated in the document to be staggered in the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the unionists the full acquittal of the court sentences for 2016.
Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned in Turkey's territorial waters on Tuesday after their boat was wrecked.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, inform the AFP, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's Coast Guard said it had managed to rescue 249 people who were in the shipwrecked boat, but their nationality is still unknown.
Previously on Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also, on the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometers from the Turkish coasts.
The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it was shipwrecked.
The route has become popular lately for immigrants who want to escape war and hard life in countries such as Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses fired because they were too fat.
Air India is firing about 130 stewards and stewardesses because they are overweight, the company announced at the end of last week.
The state company announced that the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the measure is "ridicola" and "sexist shocker", writes The Washington Post.
Mass layoff is the latest in a ten-year battle between the company and the busier stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the '80s, when Air India began using graphics with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired nine stewardesses considered "exceptionally overweight", as this "can have an effect on reflexes and prevent the agility necessary to carry out emergency measures".
The stewardesses sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them lose weight have failed," explained then a company spokesman.
A football player from Steaua teaches Gigi Becali: What a decision he made
A football player from Steaua teaches Gigi Becali how to promote young players.
If the champion's fin decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, quarterback Paul Papp opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will operate in the town of Dej, with local kids waiting for a first selection action.
I'm extremely happy to have arrived at this stage, to give the start to the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having to worry about materials in training.
They must have one care: that of playing football as well.
Technical details don't have to be their concern.
They have to put their talents to good use.
This is what the Paul Papp Football Academy wants to do.
"I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children to show them that he is with them," football player Papp told Dejeanul.ro.
Starback Academy is expecting children up to 11 years old.
The whole party wants the government.
Acting PSD President Liviu Dragnea said Tuesday that the party still wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants to, the PSD Congress will formalise the decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta expects this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants the government, the whole party.
If we want to formalise by a decision of Congress, we will do so as well.
There won't be any emotion about that.
"There were no elements, no voices in the party, no opinions in the party that would give anyone the uncertainty of the government or give anyone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in government in the current government with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the meeting of the PSD's Permanent National Bureau.
PSD announced when it will hold congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, a clear message be given if the government is to continue or if the party decides to move on.
Dragnea: I will announce on Monday if I run for office at Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he runs for a leadership position at the upcoming Congress.
I'll weigh by the Executive Committee on Monday, if the date of the congress is set.
"I will announce if I am running for office in the party leadership," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD's Permanent National Bureau.
Asked if he was hesitant about announcing his candidacy had something to do with his file, Dragnea said he didn't have that problem.
I don't have the problem you're referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party whether or not to announce a candidacy when the date of Congress is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of social-democrat subsidiaries proposed extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11th, and the exact date of Congress will be decided on Monday by the Party's Executive Committee.

An Italian was caught at Bors Customs with immigrants hiding in TIR
Two Sri Lankan citizens were spotted at Bors customs on Monday as they tried to cross the border illegally, hidden in the semi-trailer of an Italian highway.
After research, it was established that the two had paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, inform the Border Police.
In specific control, border guards noticed, in the truck cabin, a large travel bag, where personal belongings were for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough inspection of the means of transport.
On this occasion, border guards discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the freighter, among the plastic crates, two men.
From the verifications resulted that the persons concerned, two men, aged 28, are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
"In research, the young people said they intended to reach France, for which they contacted a countryman, through whom they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they were going to receive 2,000 euros per person," the Border Police communiqué said.
The two migrants were drafted "criminal work in terms of committing the crime by attempting to fraudulently cross the state border".
Also, Pompeo B., the 45-year-old Italian citizen who drove an automarfarer brand Renault Magnum, registered in Romania, carrying plastic crates for a company in Italy, was detained for 24 hours, to be presented to the Bihor Court with a proposal for a remand.
How satisfied the Romans are in the couple: Men versus women
Most Romans are happy with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted on the occasion of the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents declared themselves 'very satisfied' and 'satisfied' with the overall quality of the couple relationship.
"However, 18% is shown to be 'lightly unsatisfactory' and 'very unsatisfied' in the couple relationship, while the other 18% declare 'fit'", is the conclusion of the study, as shown in a written communiqué, Tuesday, Ziare.com.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are analysed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% suitable, 6% very dissatisfied and 8% slightly unsatisfied.
As far as women are concerned, 33% declared satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very unsatisfied, 14% slightly unsatisfied and 19% chose the right categoria.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
As for the neutral state, we see a difference of two percent.
"The same in the very unmet situation, the biggest difference being recorded at the slightly unmet answer where we see a difference of 6 percent," the communiqué also said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or even less time together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% spend between two and four hours.
The authors of the study also report that "Romanians need some more adventure in their life (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, confidence 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-knowledge 10% and control 7%".

Europe is once again disgraced.
German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe "feared shame" after the Monday failure of the ministerial meeting in Brussels on the assignment of refugees to the European Union.
"Last night (Monday evening), Europe was once again disgraced," Sigmar Gabriel, who is also Minister of Economy in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, said the AFP.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested reducing the EU's structural funds in the case of countries that reject refugee quotas.
The European Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday of emergency, failed to reach an agreement on the mandatory assignment of 120,000 refugees, requested last week by the European Commission to deal with one of the worst migratory crises in Europe after 1945.
He was mayor for only half an hour.
The interim mayor of Tuzla commune in Constanta enjoyed only half an hour of this function, due to DNA prosecutors.

Thousands of people came by to give him a candle.
Thousands of people passed through the coffin with the inanimate body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people being no longer at St. George's Church than at the refinition of the house or at Saint Nicholas's great feast, the parish priest Emil Caramizaru said on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people of all ages are waiting in line, stretching from the entrance to the church to the side streets, to pass through the cataphalus on which is the coffin with the inanimate body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor.
People wait for about an hour to reach the Church of Saint George Nou, where groups of 40 people enter.
About 300 people an hour went by Corneliu Vadim Tudor's body coffin on Wednesday.
Thousands of people from Bucharest, but also from Cluj, Baia Mare, Iasi, Constanta and Craiova came, starting on Tuesday, to pay tribute to Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people we had only at the 300-year refinition of the church and at the Great Hramul de Saint Nicholas.
"Corneliu Vadim Tudor was at the 300-year resolution of the church and stood next to the members of the Holy Synod, the Blessed Daniel and the representatives of the five patriarchs who participated in the resfinition," said the parish priest of the church in the Capital, Emil Caramizaru.
According to him, people have come with flowers and candles in their hands, sit quietly and wait in line, as on a day of great religious celebration.
It's extraordinary the behavior of these people, they sit quietly, with dignity, children, old people, men in crutches, as if they were on a great religious holiday.
"It is exciting to see them waiting to worship and pay their last respects to Vadim Tudor," said the parish priest Emil Caramizaru.
According to him, at the request of Corneliu Vadim Tudor's family, the church will remain open on Wednesday night until Thursday, last night being closed at 01:00 and reopened at 07:00 in the morning.

The parish priest made it clear that Vadim Tudor often came to this church, especially in the evening, after 8:00 p.m., and then asked him to open the rectal with the relics of Saint Nicholas and remained to pray for minutes.
He used to come here very often, usually in the evening, after 8:00 p.m., he asked me to open his relic with the relics of Saint Nicoale and pray.
He said it was a great blessing this church of Brancoveanu.
He said to me, "My brother Emil, think that there were Brancoveanu, Eminescu, Mihai the Brave, who took the hand of Saint Nicholas."
"'You realize what a blessing for this country,' Vadim called me,' said the priest.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor is to be buried Thursday at the Ghencea Civil Cemetery, with military honors.
The Senate's leadership rejected Corneliu Vadim Tudor's wife's request Tuesday that the body of the former senator's coffin be lodged in the lobby of the legislative chamber.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor was born on November 28, 1949, in Bucharest, was a writer, politician and journalist.
He was the founder of the Greater Romania Party, former member of the European Parliament and former senator.
What's going on with Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep faced a crucial decision for her career, having to choose whether or not she would continue to work with Coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year as part of the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being with the Romanian only on important tournaments.
Simona had nothing but praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to stand up to capricious sportsmanship.
The Adidas program will end at the end of this year, however, and Halep must decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or whether to give up the collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We'll talk and see.
"After Singapore I'll be able to give an answer," Simona confessed at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive trainers in the current tennis field, demanding a contract of about a million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last race Simona and Cahill will work together is the Singapore Champions Tournament.
It wasn't normal, I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with Romania's national team last autumn.
The former selector confessed that he did not get along with FRF President Razvan Burleanu, after he took Mircea Sandu's place, and thus made the decision to leave the country.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary to stay, but he was refused.
Right now I'm not sorry I left the nationals.
Then I'm sorry, we're leaving a job behind.
That's what I thought was good for me then, and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, my work wasn't respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation was at stake.
We continued the work, everything went very well, and he must have changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to leave.
If they really wanted me to stay, then I proposed a contract increase.
We have around 400 and some thousand euros a year, I was going to have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, I talked to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group," said Victor Piturca at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania's national team last autumn, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, and immediately took over Al Ittihad.
Armored and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns on the border with Serbia, following violent clashes during Wednesday, when water cannons and tear gas were used against immigrants who wanted to enter Serbia, despite Hungary lifting a barbed wire fence.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in clashes, writes Russia Today.
So far 20 cops have been injured and the ambulance service has taken over two children who have been injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by any means," Hungarian Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi's security adviser said.
The police tried to control with water cannons and tear gas the crowd of people who threw plastic bottles, stones and pieces of pavement.
Authorities reported that dozens of immigrants broke the fence at the crossing between the towns of Roszke and Horgos and managed to break into the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto urged Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" immigrants from the common border.
There are reports that the Serbians have supplemented their law enforcement forces at the border.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest suspended the border crossing from Roszke-Horgos for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted action to close its borders to prevent immigrants from accessing.
If Tuesday announced that besides the barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia, he would also raise one on the border with Romania, towards the vehement protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the lifting of a fence at the border with Croatia.
Rare illness a man suffers from
The American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely stand up and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't drink alcohol, it was obvious that he was intoxicated.
When she first accused me of being drunk without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe he was drinking alone, he's a secret alcoholic'," he says, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's videos of him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, he just didn't recognize himself: "I was looking into my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
Besides, his wife, who, although doubting him for a while, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled like alcohol.
The moment that put Nick on his mind the most was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had a three-fold alcohol level over the legal limb, although the night before he had only had one beer.
After years and innumerable investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, "Auto-brewery syndrome".
Basically, his body makes all the carbohydrates consumed ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected this could be Nick's illness was even his wife.
The disease doesn't have a cure yet, but since he quit his carbs, Nick hasn't had such episodes.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club.
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he had from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be decommissioned, he sends out BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video ended up on the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has malfunctions that endanger his life and his family.
His anger came when the dealer he bought the car from didn't solve his problem, as they had agreed.
On Wednesday, the government approved the "National Strategy on Immigration for 2015-2018" and the "Active Plan for the Year in progress", documents considered to be "another stage Romania is undertaking in its efforts to modernise the process of managing immigration on national territory", according to a press release.
The source cited shows that the strategy aims to manage immigration effectively, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action that reflect policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
Given the problems faced by the states in Romania's immediate neighbourhood, measures are envisaged for unitary and coherent management of situations caused by the possible occurrence of an influx of illegal immigrants on Romania's territory, due to political, social, economic or military crisis.
"The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time they will pay special attention to citizens from states with potential migrationist or that may harm national security," adds the mentioned source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivation of the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuation and increase in intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls of the legality of the residence of citizens of third countries on the territory of Romania and proper application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the territory of Romania of third-party citizens who respond to the needs of employment, promoting the access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that this is "a means of establishing concrete activities that will lead to the creation of a flexible system for stopping the growing migration phenomenon".
Romania, in a European top on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria registered the highest increase in total labour costs among the Member States of the European Union in the second quarter of the year, compared to the similar period in 2014, according to data published Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to employer staff expenditure.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total labour cost increased by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU to increase labour costs
The largest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where the hourly labour cost fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance of labour costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to an increase in the hourly cost of labour in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania registered a 5.8% advance on the hourly labour cost.
TVR management activity report rejected in commissions: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
Parliament’s cultural committees rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Romanian Television Society’s Board of Directors for 2014.
The report was rejected by 17 MPs, one against rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Offices meeting.
They'll probably decide next week.
The next meeting will be debated.
"I think in view of this situation it will be done relatively quickly," Senate Culture Commission President Georgica Severin said.
He added that "it was of common sense" that TVR's leadership should be present at this meeting, as no representatives of TVR's leadership were present at the meeting of the Culture Commissions.
It was common sense to have the TVR leadership present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to members of the CA since last night, about an hour ago that we didn't know the time, but today, after the meeting of the Bureau meeting, I personally sent a fax to the TVR board inviting her.
I believe that when you're summoned, you're a budgetary employee, paid out of public fees and you're called to a meeting of committee meetings even if you don't like it alive.
"Because it is your duty to work, you are in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of Parliament's Joint Culture Committees.
He added that financial aspects of the institution were discussed at the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Commissions.
The debts we saw as they continued, it came up with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but no historical payments were made.
"I remind you that it wasn't my fault or anyone else in these committees who lost that recreation with the banks and the IRS, there are clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the work report was rejected by the meeting plenary, elections would follow for a new Board of Directors, and he would elect the general director of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
Wonders won't be done.
The important thing is to make political decisions for this institution to work.
I am not his man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, Parliament's plenary, by their vote, will choose with great reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on out there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it's going to be, if you ask me what qualities it has to have - common sense in the attitude towards employees because it's a maldar of petitions coming from employees, complaints, dismissals.
"When you receive such referrals 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster," the Senate Culture Committee concluded.
Although he did not come to Parliament, the President-General of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he requested that Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to the rescue and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including indexation of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to the indexation of the TV tax, the modification and completion of HG 978/2003 on the charge for the public television service, in order to update the provisions at the level of the technological changes up-to-date, as well as the regulation of the procedure on control in the field of TV tax payment and the finding of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision to provide for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become mandaters of SRTV to collect the TV fee, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission in cash.
Stelian Tanase asks to reduce the VAT rate for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also to amend the law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility to receive budget allocations/financing for the acquisition of licenses for major cultural and sports events - World Football Championship, Golden Stag, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTV will become incapacitated in the coming months, since the labor legislation obliges the employer to enforce the court decisions, even if they are not final, and the salary rights are honoured with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has constantly made efforts to reduce staff spending and TV production.
"Thus there have been reduced movements and other cost-generating activities, a number of commercial contracts have been renegotiated, and at the end of July TVR News has been closed," the TVR president's letter says.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied by its own efforts alone.
"Without the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will be, sooner or later, unable to carry out its public mission," it is mentioned in the letter.
The House of Deputies has decided to send the letter to the Culture Commission.
Son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, sent to trial
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sued Wednesday by prosecutors of the Prosecutor's Office near the Bucharest Court of Appeals.
He is charged with tax evasion, in a file with damage of about 600,000 euros, under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was remanded on 22 May.
He founded the security company Axis Corporate Security SRL, along with his mother, in April 2009, one year after marrying Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specialized in security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been highlighted.
"In fact, fictitious acquisitions of services would have been recorded in the company's accounts, which in reality were not provided, so the state budget was damaged by about 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The Sheiks established the fate of Sanmartean
The Sheiks of the Al-Ittihad Club established the fate of the middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that the separation of Sanmartean and Ittihad is imminent, coach Ladislau Boloni's manager, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with the Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the match holder and does it well.
The Sheiks also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave him up.
It would have been the option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came of it.
"There were several discussions, such as with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing materialised," Zaporojanu said for Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu voted vice-president at the Court of Auditors
Parliamentary parliament voted Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority at the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes "for" and 108 "against" were registered.
The vote was classified, with IDs.
PNL representatives were the only ones to vote against this proposal, Digi24 informs.
Moreover, the liberals criticised Sarbu's appointment to this position and announced that they would challenge it at the CCR, given that he has a dossier at the DNA, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new office of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to make policy.
The PSD Senator will serve as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Accounts, remaining free after John Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is going to play a chef in "Burnt", the actor made a revelation his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew more in the kitchen: "I worked most of my life as a cook".
He revealed that he had worked in the kitchen since he was 15, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, and then, in college, he continued on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother has Italian origins, so his entire childhood cooked with the Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what his plans for the future were at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make five-year plans, "not even two."
"It's not motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you would laugh at if I told you," he said, but he said that what he wanted since childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, however, the actor admitted to seeing himself in the near future directing, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who started directing at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational allegations
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto harshly condemned, Wednesday morning, statements by Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta that Hungarian political decision-makers are "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational claims, offends the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slander.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has completely lost his support in domestic politics in Romania," added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to attract attention and sanction the behaviour of high Hungarian government officials, who, in his view, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not wish to respond to the challenges of Hungarian government representatives.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and to anti-Semitic attitudes, and to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" Ponta said on Facebook.
The Romanian prime minister added that he is adept at rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, as he appreciates that aggressive brutality and laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction precisely with these objectives and values!" said the head of the Romanian executive.
Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described as "simple lies" the remarks of Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta regarding Hungary's management of the refugee crisis, assessing that these statements are inappropriate for a 21st century leader, according to the MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday as the "extremist and lying concerns" of the Romanian prime minister are related to the domestic political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that I'm against xenophobic speeches the idea of shutting down borders, that all those who come are terrorists, that's Middle Ages nonsense, and I'm totally opposed to that approach.
If we can get more, we will get more, the problem is our logistical capacity to treat those people as people, not as our Hungarian neighbours treat them with bat and insert.
"This I do not agree with," the head of the Romanian executive said in a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government has decided to start preparing in the field for the expansion of the fence it is building at the border with Serbia at the border with Serbia, in order to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Afterwards, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to erect a fence on the borders would not solve anything from the refugee issue and "get Hungary out of Europe".
What's the connection between Osama bin Laden and the Mecca crane crash?
Saudi authorities have announced that Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a crane on Friday on the Mecca Grand Mosque, an accident that killed 107 people.
According to an investigation commission, the company has not "respected safety standards", the Saudi media agency (SPA) reported, reports the BBC.
Company directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation in this case was completed.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former terrorist network leader Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working on the expansion of the Great Mosque for 4 years to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred Friday night, during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong gusts of wind, collapsed on the eastern side of the roof of the Mecca Grand Mosque.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut the challengers' mouths
Considered by many the largest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after his retirement, as a weak coach who cannot perform in the new position.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future of Constanta, the team he owns.
After exactly a year of taking over the team, the King demonstrated that he was able to turn a team struggling to save from demotion into a top one.
Thus, after a year, the future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 draw and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of the top teams, fighting at the European Cups.
Things have taken an even better turn for the future this season, as the team came in second in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader of Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double the Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and lately in the starting team names such as Janis Hagi or Hodorogea have appeared.
The club's policy has made the Future a team to watch for foreign teams, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Janis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Next to the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played so far as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh country of the EU.
Large countries come with solutions for the entire EU, said Cristian Ghinea, member of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come".
But there are masses that have started and we can't turn history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as well as possible and adapt them to us.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we are at a very emotional moment, in which politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the situation now".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council that has actually solved nothing?
It is clear that the EC President in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the council.
All the picks said he had the votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applied in JHA and any state could block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, and the board approves it with the vote of 55% of states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go forward.
Because it's a sensitive issue, there were rejection reactions in Germany itself against Chancellor Merkel's opening policy, and they didn't want many countries to appear as a "EU sending migrants on our heads" reaction.
They have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governess and we will probably see big changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool off?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from individual responsibility of members who are on the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given limits to the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be waived, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state they first entered, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece falls, you can't say it's Greece's job forever.
The problem is common.
Precisely because the problem is common, is it possible to resolve without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, to share the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work if it comes to them.
Because it remains a problem: what are you doing with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will start picking up migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
There will probably be some unique filtration centres in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications can be processed.
They're working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are countries with no experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are sitting in precarious camps and who have just begun to go to Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have got to go, winter is hard to get past the Mediterranean, but we expect an even bigger wave next year.
What do we do about these people?
My prognosis is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't look at it so catastrophicly from a media point of view.
You were talking about countries with less or more experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where it has really succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Magrebians in France, at the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that doesn't mean they don't fit in at all.
There is still an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But purely police means won't work.
To create the fortress Europe is illusory.
The integration mechanisms in European societies must be scrutinised.
There have been some mistakes.
We have to be more picky.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take up values, not to stay one foot in Europe and one foot in their home country, bringing the rest of their family, including through marriages of convenience.
However, the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
Just because others have failed in long-term integration doesn't mean we have to watch them drown in the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come up with.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, it doesn't mean that the country will be restored overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions come up, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders have closed, walls are erected, border controls are reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European project at risk?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranged the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries where they first set foot these migrants.
I mean, we were running around free, but everybody's got their problems.
In the face of such a wave can't be so, because some countries can't handle it.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they're doing something, but in the long run, it doesn't change much.
After the bombings in France we don't have a much more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we did last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that sets in both ways.
And it's so unstable from week to week that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of bellicose statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the child drowned in Turkey and public opinion gets emotional.
After the public emotion passes, we will go back to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real single European market.
And I do not believe that Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there'll be other rules is different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country that thinks that if it pulls the cap on its eyes and closes its ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of migratory waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing big country.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanians' appetite for Schengen will drop greatly.
President Iohannis says it's probably a good thing we haven't already entered.
So we move from the despair of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
Of course, there is a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen so that migrants see us as the alternative route.
Which doesn't mean there's a reason why we shouldn't go into Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, will be unique rules for accepting migrants, single deportation rules for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one else died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She thinks being great power is confusing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good for him to crash before his main opponent was the Islamic State.
For a couple of years there was a struggle between the Assad regime and the moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia was able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that you can't close.
But you're only great power if you have solutions.
The off-side game is just a strategy to buy time.
Putin's probably waiting to get offers, press buttons to fix the situation.
Offers don't come because people aren't convinced that he can solve things he's also created.
But I don't agree with theories that say these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin any stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon?
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now social networking representatives are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike" button.
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on his account that this button will soon be available, informs the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg stated that the "Dislike" button will show a shade of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised the problem that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid when someone posts on his account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Dislike".
The network users, which reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long called for the possibility to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said it's not very comfortable for people to give "like" to current events, like the refugee crisis, or in the event of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving like that post," said the Facebook representative.
The version of a new button on Facebook was not welcome by everyone.
"There is already enough hatred on Facebook and social media," commented Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where the article was posted.
"I will give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, claimed there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, social media analyst at eMarketer, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she says, the election campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted on Tuesday only 70 migrants, a handful of thousands of mass-acquired at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing point and announcing that it would build a fence at its border with Romania, the DPA recalls.
The measure drew a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to ask for asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian Minister for Refugees Aleksandar Vulin said.
Before imposing the new immigration legislation, a record number of 5.809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police announced on Monday.
Also, more than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" headquarters of the County Council stands to fail.
Two builders in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, with a view to moving the institution, stand to collapse because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The county council headquarters in Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up tearing itself down.
A year and a half after the construction of the building had to be completed, the works did not reach half.
A final stage in the epoch of the building was consumed the other day, when the National Board of Appeal (CNSC) rejected a complaint by the firm that wanted to take over the contract for the implementation of the technical project for the works still to be carried out.
The initial project was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the manufacturer's insolvency and work interruption, negotiations were initiated without publication of a contract notice with Impex Romcatel, the firm would update the technical project and then a new tender for works would be organised.
"The negotiations did not, however, come to a conclusion through a contract, with the CJ considering that the proposed form would be disadvantageous to the institution," said Răzvan Timofciuc, representing public relations within the CJ.
The CJ’s decision to discontinue direct negotiations was appealed to the court by Impex Romcatel.
The JESIAN court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as late.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the CNSC decision to the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of the Court of Appeal can it be considered to find another designer.
Thus, building consolidation could resume at the earliest next year.
Our intention is to resume work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we need to reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see whether the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
The consolidation work of the former headquarters of the Police Question began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after 4,5 million lei had been carried out.
The tender was resumed and the contract was awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payments of 1.5 million lei were made.
So far, approximately 50% of the work has been done.
Initially, the consolidation, refunctionalization and attic work of the building had been evaluated at 7.7 million lei.
"All right, I'll tell you everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of Cadastre.
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the Cadastre Office signed an agreement to recognise the facts, against a delayed prison.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other defendants, headed by former chief Narciza Nedelcu
A councillor from the Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising Office (OCPI) Iași accused by the DNA in a corruption case has recognised his identity.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at Iași Court, with judges agreeing to give a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was accused of false intellectuals in continued form and agreed to execute two years in postponing prisons, as well as community service.
As regards the facts charged to Dascalu, the prosecutors stated that he, as an adviser to the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, "made in falsely several minutes of acceptance, to sell the service contracts previously keyed by OCPI Iași with the managers of SC Gauss SRL, SC Grup Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Agency of Ca dastru and Topografie SRL and PFA Lipșa Ștefan, who falsely attested that the contracted services were fully performed, given that they were not performed and were not submitted to O.C.P.I. Iași".
The other day, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OCPI were sued in this file, the charges being the settlement of services to those firms, although the work was not carried out.
Pre judicium exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
According to FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the female handball national for the qualification at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday at a meeting with the press that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Olympic Games in Rio, but for this to pass two stages of caudine pitchforks, first the World Championship and second the prequalification tournament," Dedu said.
We very much want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
The staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two measurements, goalkeeper coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get the qualifications of some things, specifically materials for physical training, that we've never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympics, and I'll do whatever it takes for me to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, it's a lot of, a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age with preparation.
"The teams with which we fight have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who noted that he was trying to obtain the necessary amounts for the purchase of these products from MTS and COSR.
The president of the FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a gym in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure issue and it is shameful to question a European gymnastics Championship.
Let us not forget that in other corners of the world, Olympic neighborhoods were built entirely within two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona there was a landfill, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the organisation of the 2012 Olympics was a success in terms of investments.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to give Romania a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civil with a project, people agreed in principle, but it became clear very quickly that the hall will never be built.
I also had discussions with EHF, I told them that we wanted to, that we were able to organize and they said that they would agree and invite them to the first game in the new hall in Bucharest and then we talk concretely.
"So we have all the openness, both at EHF and at IHF, but we have no infrastructure," explained the official FRH.
The former great handball player avoided assessing the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I asked all coaches to be booked in predictions, that if they don't come true they turn against them."
Have a safe trip to the World Cup
Romanian Rugby debuts on September 23, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said in a press conference on Tuesday that all the members of the Romanian team are ready for the matches at the World Cup in England, where he hopes to win two victories: "We are ready".
Both my colleagues and I are at full speed.
We trained to give the best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win two games against Canada and Italy.
All groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But surely, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the triumph of so many years of work.
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romania's national team selector Lynn Howells, who was first in experience as World Cup coach, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
For me, it's an extraordinary experience.
For me it is very important that every game to make Romanians proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraș, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in rugby in recent years.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's teams around 18-19 years old, so there's cohesion, there's a band of friends, who set themselves up to realize a dream," Dumitraș said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will compete in Group D, with the following matches scheduled: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition begins on Friday at Twickenham Stadium in London, with the England–Fiji group A match.
New Japanese culture courses organized at the University of "Al.I. Cuza"
About the flower arrangement in a vase, the ink painting, but also an easy study of the beautiful arts specific to the Land of the Rise you can learn at the courses organized by the students of Iasi.
The Japanese Culture Students’ Circle in Iași organizes new Japanese culture courses (ikebana, Sumie and Fine Arts) between October 2015 and June 2016, courses for beginners as well as for people with expertise.
They will take place at the Centre of European Studies of the University "Al. I. Cuza" in Iasi and are organized to promote Japanese, traditional and modern arts and culture.
For these there is only one participation fee of 50 lei per month per person.
Apart from the art lessons, participants will be able to participate in exhibitions and other cultural activities promoting beauty.
The Japanese culture courses I proposed to you were designed as an invitation, addressed to the general public, to take the first steps on the road to self-knowledge through art.
"The interested people will be able to learn how to produce harmonious floral creations (ikebana), how to capture the soul of the surrounding elements in plastic compositions using the Japanese art of ink painting (Sumie) or how to express their own individuality and creativity through the plurivalent universe of beautiful arts (graphic, drawing, painting)," said Sorin Mazilu, professor of these courses.
The courses are addressed to all those who are passionate about art, regardless of age or experience.
Registrations take place until September 30, and those who want to ask for more information can do so at the phone number: 0742.027.153 or at the e-mail address: studenticulture@gmail.com.
14 million lei give to the Hospital "St. Spiridon" in Iasi at the budget adjustment
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiridon" received about 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health, following the budgetary adjustment.
The money that the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and arrangement of clinics, as well as in medical equipment and technique for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new tomography computer, with a new radiology machine, with six kits used for surgery, six ICU beds properly equipped, eye microscope and other devices necessary for the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and installation works of the "Marelui Ars".
Out of the money from the budget adjustment, the UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section.
"In addition, the following days we will make the reception of the works from the bridge linking UPU to the clinics of cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology to ensure the decent transport of the patient from UPU to the neighbouring clinics," explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have in the courtyard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tătăreşi, which it will organize in the outpatient, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where allergology, haematology and endocrinology are located in the outpatient and will have about 30 beds.
The coward, embarrassed by RATP controllers and a flyer.
The grassland of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After experience, neither I nor my wife want to set foot in your town again.
Unwittingly, they ran into the wrong information in the flyers, the insatiability of RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "that's what the law says".
The wives arrived in Iasi a few days ago, checked into a hotel in the Centre and asked for travel leaflets.
They also received a flyer in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the husbands visited the Iasi.
But two days ago, you're in the Copou, they wanted to get to the Palas Mall.
Because there was no ticket truck in the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the flyer: that they could take a ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the flyer, they got on a bus and tried to text after the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers appeared.
They said there was no service for two years and that it was announced in the press that it was canceled.
How am I supposed to know what was written in the local press, me coming in the night before I visited town?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all they could do was give us one ticket instead of 2 (me and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my visitation day sitting at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!" Ovidiu says.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of the erroneous information on the flyer and the controllers who "applied the law to blood".
It's not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about the money, it's not too much, but the point is, I felt wrong.
Bad luck for the rapists in Vaslui.
They had an accident and remained in pre-trial custody
The trial of the seven rapists at Vaslui moved yesterday to the Iași Court of Appeal.
The JESIAN magistrates tried the first term of trial in a non-public court in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Prior to the actual beginning of the hearing, one of the Judges of Iasi to whom the case had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was accepted by his colleagues at the court.
The magistrate served until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the Pe nale Section, who, on 9 April, admitted an appeal filed by four of the defendants, ordering them to be placed under house arrest.
Currently, the file is being tried by a panel of magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, Judge Dan An's file also issued a restraining order on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubinating relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges have decided that Vaslui's rapists will remain in remand.
The Norse will remain incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when the Dreading Judges will re-discuss the possibility of their release.
The next court term will be held at the Iași Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Iași Court of Appeal, the van with which the Vaslui rapists were transported was involved in an accident in the Păcurari district, the car entering Iași on the belt.
Iveco's car carrying the seven rapists hit a Volks wagen car that came out of Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The van runs from the end.
The car entered Iasi through here because the employees of the Administration of Penitentiaries preferred the route from Vaslui to Iași through the Stables, then on the belt road.
They cut the road a few miles short.
Immediately after the impact, the arrested escort called another shipment, to take over the prisoners.
Soon, a car was sent to the scene from the Iași Maximum Safety Penitentiary, which took over the seven prisoners and transported them to the Court of Appeals.
Following the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the arrests came out in gear, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because the drivers of the two vehicles have been amicably agreed on the damages to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Mădălin Taranu of the IPJ.
Greater migrations
Romania is not and will not be ready for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and clear: the 7000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalize are, in itself, an insignificant number, but huge compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, amounting to about 1500 souls, goes far beyond our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of integrating them quickly into Romanian society are extremely low.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose patience.
Parasited by the underworld and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The failure to integrate the gypsies is just a trivial example.
Besides, governments of every color have not been able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent healthcare, clean up dirt on the street, create honorable paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another fleeing country?
But what brings great wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
First of all, we are dealing with the belligerent hypocrisy of the strong states of the EU, which are most generous when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Probably afraid of someone stealing his national being.
After all, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they only invoke the horrors of war as a reason for their departure, accept no other destination for the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Furthermore, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed can only be mocked.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and by relying strictly on the book of political fairness, they demand peace and investment for migrants' countries of origin.
But there is peace in Romania, and even once in a while, some foreign capital enters the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosed, divided and obsolete construction.
I deplored the fact that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but, look, the EU doesn't have any future plans either.
And improvisations and threats don't help.
Then, what good is the EU, if the only advantage Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
But not the migrant crisis.
Over the next decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and especially from Africa to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be ready for what is to come.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Club Pogor.
Destination, practically imposed
The concession tender shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of being closed, the club in the courtyard of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for concession for a duration of 10 years.
The construction has a useful surface area of 134 sq.m, on two levels of hrube.
CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of literary cafes, bookstores or other cultural activities.
The building was evaluated at 68,300 euros, with a starting value of 6,830 euros annually, with a bidding step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to operate the building continuously and continuously and fully cover the rehabilitation costs of the building in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period during which the catering unit operated in these spaces, and even after its discharge, no current repair and maintenance work was carried out as is currently required during the operation of a building," the tender procedure documentation is mentioned.
The club's concession offers are expected until September 18.
Two little brothers in Tomești swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-olds and 11-year-olds from Tomești, brothers, swallowed several pills of Diazepam.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was on treatment, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were rushed to the hospital "Saint Mary" in Iasi.
They're stable, according to the doctors.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20 he received a courageous gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the dark of the 1990s, when she had only two months of life, little, sickly and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years as adoption was vaguely regulated, a young girl who had gone out, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met again the day before yesterday in Iasi with the biological parents from a village of the county, after almost two decades when no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will be 20 years old these days, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to give their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iași, in order to get to know her unclear past.
"The newspaper of Iași", which witnessed efforts to search for the family of origin after a few very vague clues, witnessed these encounters that practically break your heart.
The story of reporters, the emotions of moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are really moving and overwhelming.
The story of the Lily begins 20 years ago in the town of Iași Ruginosa, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home there began to be misunderstandings between parents, and the mother had to appear her home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me away.
He stopped the girl, and I haven't known anything since.
"When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late," remembers grieving Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Pașcani, and at the same time the girl's father, Costica Balcan, went to work in Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives would part forever.
They couldn't find Crina at the hospital.
After admission, Lily's father went to work in another locality, and returned six months later.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iasi, and the father, when he returned, never found her.
It must have been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"She must have thought she was abandoned," tells a granddaughter of the family.
Due to financial problems, Grandma was unable to come with Crina to Iași, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one else has been interested in the fate of the child during this time, it was taken over by the Directorate General for Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, who then gave it to the Plasmation Centre in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but couldn't.
They fell in love on the spot with blonde Crina, and after some time she would move with them to Italy.
The little girl had already done almost two years, while the adoption formalities took place.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given him life," she says smiling Salvadore, the adoptive father, as he grabs the girl's fragile hand in his hand.
In the country, the parents of the Lily, Alina and Costica, continued their search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the Rusty authorities, but received no answer as to where his child might be.
The police then told her that she may be dead, but in Iasi the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me at the courthouse she was away in Italy, in Palermo.
And conditions to look for it I never had.
We prayed to God that it would be okay.
I thought about her all those years ago, but there were no possibilities to walk, to find her.
"It's hard," the Lily's biological mother tells us with tears in her eyes.
Even though the years have passed, the parents of Rusinos have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," Crina said.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Adviser Iași, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore's desire to find the Lilie's biological family.
And the search only started with one name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I had just received a name, Balcan Costica, then the town Ruginosa.
Soon I had an activity with the city hall there, and I could ask if there was a name in the village.
Then they gave me some indication, except the person they found wasn't the one they wanted.
"It took us about a month to find the girl's biological father," Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim explains.
In total, it took more than three months for the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially since each had a place of residence in another locality.
We started the work somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we set a first meeting for September," Romica Ichim added.
In the past weekend, Alina and Costica first saw their lost girl in the hallways of the hospital in Iași, 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could barely contain his tears, and his hands trembled constantly.
He barely has a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was all excited, shaking.
"To see your child after all these years, there is something," says a niece, who came with Costica from Rusinoasa.
Lilie meeting with biological mother and brother
In talks with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-listed university in Italy, Costica Balcan told him, among other things, that if she ever wanted to return to him in the village, she could come quietly: she could give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and build a household.
My mom's nervous too, she's crying, and she hardly thinks anything like this can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I never thought anything like this could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've been thinking these years, I've been hoping, but I never thought I could be like this.
They're very excited.
If only he could forgive me.
I hope we visit each other in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," tells us with great tears on Alina's cheeks, Lily's mother, while holding a napkin tight in her hand.
In him she still hides her tears, from happiness, because soon she will see her face after so much time.
On the other side, Crina, who will be only a few days away, this month, 20 years old, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she sketched a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are the ones who raised me after all.
It'll be a nice date, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a beautiful memory of them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family reunion in Iasi
In the Unirii Square, under the early autumn sky, the family of Ruginosa again joins their destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing high school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
They no longer divide borders or countries, but only one barrier: that of the tongue.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the centre of Iasi, easily crossed.
Those who managed to make this meeting possible say it is the first such event done, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do so again.
It's the first event of its kind organized by such an emotional charge, and I'm glad to be a success.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with the users, the drug addicts.
But we're trying to give society back something good.
"If I am requested for such an event again, I will do so with great love," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Adviser Iași.
Behind him, the Balcans, with Crina in the middle, walk away by telling stories.
They understand: they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice with guns to the leg yesterday at PSD.
Everybody's taking a breath.
Camps in the Iasi PSD branch concluded a truce with a gun at their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Iasi Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for the party's positions.
Far from being over, the internal war in the party seems to have only taken a break to allow the combatants to catch their breath.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He has released a very simple and very current message under the circumstances now: try to find a solution so as not to endanger the party.
On October 3rd, we have an election in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica, said.
The two days of weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing was certain.
In October elections, a fierce competition is expected for the president of the PSD's county branch.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main office of the party's Iasi branch are Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, County Councilman Vasile Ccea and Acting President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
To them could be added the mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
One option considered is the candidacy of the leader of PSD county councillors, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer enter the race, sources within the party claiming that he is not interested in the function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of former branch leader Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, candidates can be submitted on election day, and it would not surprise anyone if they did.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain after October 3rd, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent County Office and all new governing structures," Catea said.
Until the internal elections are held, the management of the PSD county branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
However, Lupu is on leave until September 29th, with the preparation of the elections being practically ensured by the branch's executive secretary, county councilman Mihail Popescu, in cold relations with Camp Nichita.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the discussions of the last few days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached in support of a unitary team dealing with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several options regarding the intentions related to the candidacy for the PSD presidency Iași, the list remaining open," Stanciu commented.
A judge in Iasi refused the Vaslui rape case on the grounds of cohabitation
The seven young men in Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at Iași Court of Appeal.
Vasluians sentenced to punishments between five and eight months and eight years and four months will present today their arguments for their release, after the court of law, Vaslui Court, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence.
The file was registered with the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with magistrate Dan Anton making a request for restraint, accepted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luke defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How Judges Motivated the Sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate at Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young men motivated the sentence.
In motivation, the judge speaks about the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong feeling of outrage among the public.
"The court finds that after placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not a custodial measure, under the impact of the defendants' attitude, their families and their local supporters, a strong feeling of indignation was felt at the level of the local and national community about the fact that people accused of serious crimes are judged under a less restrictive measure," says the Vaslui Court's statement.
The magistrates also disassembled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial claimed that the girl they raped would not be a "church door".
"The court points out that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, which the defendants wanted to highlight by their defences, as a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," the motivation further states.
Corbin, Brexit and the Future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past decades cannot continue the same in the coming years.
By Saturday, probably few people knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he has become the new leader of the UK Labour Party, many wonder to what extent the choice of a politician that, after all, is not in a decision-making position can affect us.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of post-war labor.
Marxist, declared anti-monarchist (at one time asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and the terrorist Hizbollah and Hamas movements, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time considered the murder of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
Following the pattern of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what Tsipras was saying and promising in Greece until he faced the real world and economic laws.
The economic programme of the new Labour Leader foresees, among other things, massive renationalisation and printing of money as a solution to finance projects for the development and coverage of very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution to printing money is not universally adopted around the world, we would then have a general global prosperity!, but who would stumble over such details.
Of course, we can tax the bankers in blood, you become some kind of service enemies of the left, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand and Hollande's mandates.
The extra amounts are quickly swallowed by the generous, uncovered promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher well pointed out, "the problem with socialism is that at some point other people's money runs out.
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in conviction as the new leader of the party, failed miserably in the elections.
And then there was still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more sensitive than they are now.
With the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant throughout the workforce and extensive automation have made the industry need a massively skilled workforce, Corbin's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, it can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In its latest Financial Times issue, Corbyn's election increases the chances of Brexit and Britain leaving the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the EU to the ground, you get explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the Union to lose symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep faults created within it by the Euro crisis and now that of refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
All the more so since for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (where Berlin is becoming more and more the dominant actor anyway).
True, the British business environment, City, are powerful lawyers of the country's stay in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one of the past.
There are a lot of resentments that are increasing in intensity these very weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we have just recently had a sample in Jean Clude Junker's speech, increasingly tends to make major decisions over the head of the large majority of the Member States by consulting with just a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this is when the electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are also Eurosceptics is growing spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the negative-loaded emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever before.
Hence the conclusion that the Financial Times draw when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation starting from national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in today's politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we see greater integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States fuels populist rhetoric from frustrations accumulated in Occidental societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the past decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the coming years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-Immigration area, both caused by hasty decisions that have taken into account only the integrated political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can seriously affect Romania's situation.
And it's hard to rule something out from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncuși, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
But behind his reputation lies something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
That something has a name.
It's called "trude."
What do you write about Constantin Brancusi?
What else is there to say?
His face appeared on the bills.
And recently, a well-known Romanian bank hired an actor to play it in an ad clip.
Brâncuşi produces and delivers money almost 60 years after he is no longer with us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and avenues that bear his name.
Moreover, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with the baby, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to Brâncuși".
The country is littered with its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brâncuși's infiltration capacity is huge.
The communists failed to remove it from Romania's memory and culture.
Its quotes are spreading the Internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and share.
And then, again, what would there be to say, to write about this man?
From the pile of books and articles trying to reconstruct his destiny, Brâncuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you haven't had the chance to be born in a big city and in a little wealthy family, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brâncuși's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe this is where we should start the following text.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Forget the stupid success stories that are delivered to you every day in the newspapers and on TV.
Take a good look at this man's face.
Do you want to know how he managed in life, how, today, did he hear an entire world?
It's simple.
He's worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on 19 February 1876, in Hobița, a small village in Pestișani commune, Gorj county, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncuşi leads a modest life, but one of which will collect the landmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre Țuțea, in Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious.
For millennia, people lived, happily, a patriarchal life.
Everything went smoothly from one season to the next.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has come to us.
Brâncuși's childhood, however, was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these first years of life is highly suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor's years in his hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brancusi. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuși was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the cheese was made, following those who taste the liquid to see if the process was going well, Brâncusi caught a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palms with henry and drinks unbreathed.
He falls in his sleep almost instantly.
The first people don't notice until a few minutes later.
My mother panics, then goes into hysteria, thinking her son died.
Towards the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by the fiddlers, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who wait for him with their breath.
The party's turning into mourning.
Father's already thinking about burying.
However, one finds it good to call Baba Brândusa, a doctor and servant of the Brancus.
Brandusa checks the baby's breath, then puts horse dung under his nose, gathered around.
The baby sneezes heavily.
People applaud.
While the boy is allowed to sleep on his drunkenness, with joy, the party with the fiddlers continues with even more force.
The next day, father and son meet in the orchard.
Radu Brâncuși has Constantine gather some rods and bring them to him.
The father places his child upside down and, with the rods brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the sting of the blows, little Brâncuși has the revelation that the world can be seen from a different perspective and that things around him can appear upside down.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would admit in his old age, if the astral itself was participating in his disorder.
Could the sun have been as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?
Currently, the city is not working
A MP appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on PSD and PNL to stop internal fighting and refocus their agenda on the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a big divide and that's it.
We haven't seen anything from the USL projects since 2012.
No highway, no Regional Emergency Hospital, just see how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let's put the politics aside, get together and talk.
At the moment, the city is not working.
"If you're busy with internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you," Blăjuț said.
He appreciated that the current political class failed the electorate of Iasi, the result being a very small presence in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
He also believes that voters will also turn to traditional parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, such as the "For Iași" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break out of the right electorate, not the PSD.
Such parties rely on active civic people, who are usually right-wing.
"It crumbles even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said Blajuț.
He noted that he was not interested in a bid for the upcoming local elections, denying rumours of his intention to join the mayoral race.
I also said I don't want to run for any local office.
I am also considering whether to continue as a Member in the future term.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iași and in the lobby discussions with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to get a picture.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything anymore," said Blăjuț, who appreciated that the main reason the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
A colleague from Tatarasi said his money wasn't enough and he had to take the bus.
Let's not be hypocritical.
There's little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up money from the cashier.
At the end of my term, I will report on everything I have spent, apart from the salaries of cabinet employees and its maintenance.
I happened to raise 30,000 lei in a month, with all the shipping accounts, accommodation and others.
"Let a parliamentarian say that his money is not enough is pure hypocrisy," Blăjuț concluded.
